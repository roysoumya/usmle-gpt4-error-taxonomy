Diagnosis is confirmed with duplex ultrasound, which shows a thrombus obstructing the blood flow.\n\n'B': Erysipelas, is an acute bacterial skin infection typically caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. It is characterized by well-demarcated, raised borders and is usually accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever and chills.\n\n'C': Erythema nodosum, is an inflammatory condition characterized by tender, erythematous nodules, usually on the anterior surface of the lower legs. It's not typically associated with swelling and does not cause vascular wall thickening.\n\n'D': Varicose veins, are dilated, tortuous veins due to valvular incompetence. They do not typically present with pain, erythema, or a palpable cord.\n\n'E': Superficial thrombophlebitis, is inflammation and thrombus formation in a superficial vein.

Given her history of two hormone-sensitive cancers (breast and endometrial cancer), the most appropriate first-line treatment for osteoporosis in this patient would be a bisphosphonate, such as alendronate. Bisphosphonates work by attaching to hydroxyapatite binding sites on bony surfaces, especially those undergoing active resorption, and are thereby ingested by osteoclasts. The bisphosphonate compounds then induce osteoclast apoptosis, leading to decreased bone resorption and turnover (Choice C). \n\nThe other options all represent different treatments for osteoporosis. However, they would not be appropriate first-line therapies in this patient. Raloxifene (Choice A) is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that acts as an estrogen receptor agonist in bone. However, it acts as an estrogen receptor antagonist in breast and uterine tissue, making it a good choice for osteoporosis prevention in patients with a history of hormone-sensitive cancers (Choice B). Unfortunately, it is less effective than bisphosphonates at increasing bone mineral density and preventing fractures. Calcitonin (Choice D) is a hormone that can be used in osteoporosis to inhibit osteoclast activity, but it is less effective than other treatments and is not typically used as first-line therapy. Lastly, teriparatide (Choice E) is a recombinant form of parathyroid hormone that actually increases bone turnover and bone mineral density.

The description of visual problems with double vision when looking to the sides is consistent with bilateral dysfunction of cranial nerve VI (abducens nerve), which innervates the lateral rectus muscle of the eye and is responsible for lateral gaze. The abducens nerves travel along the base of the brain and are susceptible to injury from increased intracranial pressure, specifically in the case of uncal herniation, where the medial part of the temporal lobes (the uncus) herniates downward, compressing the brainstem and cranial nerves.

This is achieved by increasing the diameter of the blood vessels in the lungs, which reduces the resistance to blood flow and allows more oxygen to be picked up by the red blood cells.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\n'A': Decreased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration would actually impair oxygen-carrying capacity as it refers to the average concentration of hemoglobin in a given volume of blood. Living at high altitudes typically prompts the body to produce more red blood cells and thus more hemoglobin, not less.\n\n'B': Decreased red blood cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) would impair oxygen delivery to tissues. Increased levels of 2,3-DPG actually enhance oxygen delivery by promoting the release of oxygen from hemoglobin in the peripheral tissues.

This can include factors such as urinary retention, urinary tract stones (nephrolithiasis), urinary tract obstruction, renal insufficiency, immunosuppression, or the presence of an indwelling urinary catheter. \n\nPatients with diabetes, like this woman, are also at increased risk for complicated UTIs due to factors such as glucose in the urine that can facilitate bacterial growth and impaired host immune response. UTIs caused by atypical organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is seen typically in hospital-acquired infections, are also generally considered complicated because they may be associated with underlying urinary tract abnormalities and are often resistant to first-line antibiotics.\n\nHowever, the mere presence of an atypical organism, such as Candida albicans, does not in itself define a UTI as complicated. Candida species are not commonly involved in uncomplicated UTIs, but they may cause UTIs in patients with other predisposing risk factors such as immunosuppression or an indwelling urinary catheter. Nonetheless, the organism itself does not dictate whether a UTI is categorized as complicated or uncomplicated, but rather the underlying conditions that predispose to infection.

Aminolevulinate dehydratase.\n\nThis patient's symptoms of dark urine, abdominal pain, and peripheral neuropathy in conjunction with a history of phenytoin use suggest an attack of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). AIP is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a deficiency of porphobilinogen deaminase, which is involved in the heme synthesis pathway. This leads to an accumulation of upstream metabolites, particularly aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen. However, the neurologic manifestations seen in AIP (eg, neuropathy, neuropsychiatric symptoms) are believed to be caused by ALA.\n\nDuring an acute attack, glucose and hemin (a heme analogue) are administered. Glucose administration helps by inducing insulin secretion, which decreases ALA synthase expression. Hemin works by inhibiting ALA synthase-1, the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the heme synthesis pathway in the liver. By suppressing the heme synthesis pathway, hemin reduces the accumulation of neurotoxic precursors (eg, ALA).\n\nThe other enzymes listed are also involved in the heme synthesis pathway, but are not specifically targeted for inhibition in the treatment of acute AIP:\n- ALA synthase (Option B) is the enzyme inhibited by hemin and glucose to prevent further accumulation of porphyrins and precursors.\n- Ferrochelatase (Option C) and uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (Option E) deficiencies are associated with different types of porphyria (eg, erythropoietic protoporphyria and porphyria cutanea tarda, respectively), not AIP.\n- Porphobilinogen deaminase (Option D) is deficient in AIP; however, the treatment is not aimed at inhibiting this enzyme."]},{"id":"item298","serial_num":1835,"text":["<strong>USMLE question:</strong> A 40-year-old man presents with a rash, oral lesions, and vision problems for 5 days.

Bone is the third most common site of metastasis (following lung and liver) for many malignancies, including breast cancer. Back pain is a common symptom of vertebral metastases and may occur because of pathologic fracture, which seems to be the case in this patient, or spinal cord compression.

Risk factors for HAP include mechanical ventilation, which bypasses the upper airway's defense mechanisms, allowing bacteria direct access to the sterile lower respiratory tract. Antibiotic treatment is often ineffective, despite in vitro susceptibility of the pathogen, due to inadequate antibiotic penetration into the lung parenchyma and respiratory secretions, making poor delivery of the medicines to the target tissue (Choice E) the most likely cause of treatment failure.\n\nThe other choices do not typically account for antibiotic treatment failure in cases of pneumonia. For instance, abnormally rapid clearance of the medicines by the kidney (Choice A) is unlikely without evidence of renal dysfunction. Similarly, abnormally rapid metabolism of the medicines by the liver (Choice B) is a less likely cause of treatment failure as neither cefepime nor daptomycin is metabolized by the liver. Inactivation of the medicine in the target tissue (Choice C) is not a common reason for treatment failure in HAP. Lastly, low bioavailability of the medicines (Choice D) is not a concern as both antibiotics are given intravenously, which ensures 100% bioavailability."]},{"id":"item402","serial_num":2352,"text":["<strong>USMLE question:</strong> Two hours after a 2280-g male newborn is born at 38 weeks' gestation to a 22-year-old primigravid woman, he has 2 episodes of vomiting and jitteriness.

Hyperinsulinism.\n\nThis newborn's hypoglycemia (glucose <40 mg\/dL), jitteriness, poor feeding, and high hematocrit are most likely due to maternal smoking, which leads to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and chronic fetal hypoxia. Chronic fetal hypoxia results in increased erythropoiesis and subsequent polycythemia (Hct >65%), which can be seen with facial plethora and symptomatic hyperviscosity (eg, poor feeding, lethargy, irritability). Fetal hypoxia also induces hyperplasia of the pancreatic islets and increased insulin production, leading to neonatal hypoglycemia.\n\nOption A (Transient tachypnea of the newborn) is incorrect.

Asbestos exposure is most commonly associated with shipbuilding, roofing, and plumbing. The most common pulmonary findings in patients with asbestos exposure are pleural plaques, which are areas of fibrous thickening of the pleura that can be seen on x-ray or CT. However, these plaques do not correlate with the extent of exposure and do not result in impaired lung function.\n\nThe most serious complication of asbestos exposure is malignant mesothelioma, a rare and aggressive cancer that primarily affects the pleura. This risk is synergistically increased with concomitant tobacco smoke exposure. Other pulmonary conditions associated with asbestos exposure include asbestosis (fibrosis of the lungs due to asbestos) and bronchogenic carcinoma.\n\nBronchogenic carcinoma (option A) is less likely in this patient despite his heavy smoking history because the radiographic findings are more consistent with asbestos exposure.

Epidural hematomas typically occur after a fracture of the skull during a traumatic event. The fracture damages the middle meningeal artery leading to rapid accumulation of arterial blood between the dura and the skull. The hematoma can compress the brain and shift the midline structures, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure and herniation. The classic clinical presentation of an EDH is a brief loss of consciousness (concussion), followed by a lucid interval, and then progressive loss of consciousness and neurologic symptoms. These symptoms occur due to continued bleeding and increasing intracranial pressure. The CT scan findings typically show a convex or lentiform hematoma that does not cross the suture lines. The treatment of choice is immediate surgical evacuation of the hematoma to decrease the intracranial pressure and prevent herniation. Therefore, the answer is 'B' Surgical evacuation of the clots.\n\nNow, option 'A' Administration of levetiracetam is incorrect because it is used to prevent seizures but there is no evidence of seizures in this patient. Option 'C' Lumbar puncture is contraindicated in patients with increased intracranial pressure as it can lead to brain herniation.

Chronic cocaine use is a recognized cause of dilated cardiomyopathy. \n\nOption 'C' Radiation therapy, can also cause dilated cardiomyopathy. Radiation induces fibrosis and vascular injury, which can result in myocardial damage and eventually cardiomyopathy. \n\nOption 'A' Amyloid production can cause restrictive cardiomyopathy, not dilated.

ACEI-AE is due to the accumulation of bradykinin, a potent vasodilator, which can result in the rapid development of marked angioedema. Management involves discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor (Option D). In addition to discontinuation, acute episodes of AE can be treated with airway management and either C1 esterase inhibitor, ecallantide, or icatibant.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they do not address the root cause of the angioedema.\n\nFresh frozen plasma (Option A) is used for hereditary angioedema, not ACEI-AE.

Acute urinary retention is a urologic emergency that needs immediate catheterization. This patient's symptom could be a side effect of Pregabalin (option B), which is a medication frequently used in the treatment of neuropathic pain, such as that caused by herpes zoster (shingles). Pregabalin has anticholinergic effects, which can lead to urinary retention, particularly in men with BPH.\n\nWhy the other options are wrong:\n\nSimvastatin (option A) is a drug used to lower cholesterol levels and hence reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease.

DKA is caused by absolute or relative insulin deficiency. Lack of insulin results in hyperglycemia, volume depletion due to osmotic diuresis, and a shift from carbohydrate to fat metabolism. This last mechanism results in the production of ketone bodies, which, along with lactic acid, contribute to a high anion gap metabolic acidosis.\n\nInitial treatment for DKA includes insulin and aggressive fluid resuscitation with isotonic saline to restore intravascular volume and decrease counterregulatory hormones, which will decrease ketogenesis. Insulin will decrease serum glucose levels and suppress ketogenesis. Therefore, when glucose levels decrease to <250 mg\/dL, 5% dextrose should be added to the maintenance fluid to allow continued insulin administration until ketogenesis has stopped, while avoiding hypoglycemia. Consequently, the most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous 5% dextrose and 1\/2 isotonic saline (Option E). The administration of sodium bicarbonate is generally not recommended because it does not improve outcomes and can potentially cause harm (Option C). In addition, this patient's potassium level is currently normal, so there is no need to administer potassium chloride (Option D). Subcutaneous insulin glargine is a long-acting insulin that is used for maintenance therapy in stable diabetic patients (Option A). It is not used in the acute management of DKA as it does not have a rapid onset of action."]},{"id":"item397","serial_num":2314,"text":["<strong>USMLE question:</strong> A 14-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of a 1-week history of fever, malaise, and chest pain.

The immune response can result in permanent heart valve damage, predominantly of the mitral valve but also of the aortic valve.\n\nPatients with a history of ARF are at increased risk for recurrent episodes, which can cause or worsen rheumatic heart disease. To prevent recurrent ARF, patients are given continuous antibiotic prophylaxis against Streptococcus.

The most common type of lung cancer in nonsmokers, adenocarcinoma, often arises from the mucous-producing glands in the periphery of the lung. This malignancy is also the most common type of lung cancer in women and individuals under 45 years old. Though the woman has never smoked, her history of peptic ulcer disease with positive H. pylori biopsy indicates a potential risk. It has been observed in studies that H. pylori, an organism capable of provoking a significant inflammatory response, may play a role in the development of extragastric malignancies, including lung cancer. \n\nOption A (Medication) is incorrect as there is no information in the patient's history suggesting any medication that might have predisposed her to lung cancer. \n\nOption B (Occupational history) is incorrect because teaching is not typically associated with an increased risk of lung cancer.

This is achieved primarily in the principal cells of the collecting ducts via increased activity of luminal potassium channels (choice E). This allows for more potassium to be secreted into the tubule and excreted in the urine.\n\nAs for the other options:\nOption A: Increased activity of H+\/K+ antiporter in a-intercalated cells could actually exacerbate hyperkalemia as this antiporter moves potassium into the blood and hydrogen ions into the urine. \nOption B: The activity of epithelial sodium channels in principal cells, which are involved in sodium reabsorption, is not directly related to potassium homeostasis.\nOption C: Decreased activity of the Na+\/K+\/2Cl- cotransporter in the loop of Henle would reduce sodium reabsorption and potentially lead to hyponatremia, not hyperkalemia.\nOption D: Decreased activity of the Na+\/H+ antiporter in the proximal convoluted tubule would impair sodium reabsorption and acid-base balance, but it would not directly impact potassium homeostasis."]},{"id":"item639","serial_num":7863,"text":["<strong>USMLE question:</strong> A 20-year-old man comes to the clinic complaining of shoulder pain for the past week.

The supraspinatus is one of the four muscles of the rotator cuff and contributes to shoulder stability. It is primarily responsible for the first 15 degrees of arm abduction. Injuries are common in athletes who perform overhead throwing movements (e.g., baseball pitchers, tennis players). The \"empty can\" test, in which the patient resists downward pressure on the arm while it is elevated to 90 degrees and internally rotated (thumb pointed down), is commonly used to evaluate for supraspinatus muscle injury. The supraspinatus muscle is innervated by the suprascapular nerve. \n\nOption A, Accessory nerve, is incorrect because this nerve innervates the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles, not the muscles of the rotator cuff. Option C, Long thoracic nerve, is incorrect because this nerve innervates the serratus anterior muscle, not the muscles of the rotator cuff. Option D, Subscapular nerve, is incorrect because this nerve innervates the subscapularis muscle, not the supraspinatus muscle.

The pathogenesis of RA is a result of both type III and type IV hypersensitivity reactions. Thus, the answer is B: 'Both type II and III hypersensitivities'.\n\nIn the early stages of the disease, immune complexes (antigen-antibody) deposit on the synovial membrane leading to the activation of complement and recruitment of inflammatory cells, which is characteristic of type III hypersensitivity reactions. As the disease progresses, T cells (type IV hypersensitivity) become involved and are responsible for the ongoing chronic inflammation in the synovium.\n\nOption A: 'Self-tolerance' is not correct because it is a normal process that prevents the immune system from attacking its own tissues.

An increase in serum phosphate stimulates PTH secretion, which in turn increases the renal excretion of phosphate. This is the body's primary mechanism for preventing hyperphosphatemia.\n\nHigh levels of PTH also increase the conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) in the kidney. Calcitriol increases intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate.\n\nHowever, in this case of hyperphosphatemia, the high phosphate levels would cause a decline in calcitriol synthesis as a feedback mechanism to prevent further increase in phosphate levels. Also, PTH would promote calcium reabsorption in the kidney and bone resorption, to increase serum calcium levels. Despite these compensatory actions, the initial effect of phosphate load may cause serum total calcium to decrease due to formation of calcium-phosphate product.\n\nThe other options are incorrect mainly because they do not account for the body's compensatory mechanisms in response to hyperphosphatemia. For example, any option suggesting a decrease in PTH is incorrect because PTH levels would increase in response to high phosphate levels. Also, any option suggesting an increase in serum total calcium or calcitriol is incorrect because these would decrease as a result of the phosphate infusion."]},{"id":"item651","serial_num":8362,"text":["<strong>USMLE question:</strong> A 9-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician by his parents with a fever, cough, and cold symptoms that began 7 days ago.

First-line treatment for status epilepticus is benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam, diazepam), which enhance \u00ce\u00b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity by prolonging the duration of chloride channel openings. This results in hyperpolarization of the neuron and decreased ability to reach the threshold potential necessary for action potential propagation.\n\nOption B (Increase in frequency of chloride channel opening) is incorrect because this is the mechanism of action for barbiturates such as phenobarbital, not benzodiazepines.\n\nOption C (Blockage of voltage-gated calcium channels) is incorrect because this is the mechanism of action for drugs like gabapentin and pregabalin. These drugs are used primarily for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia, and as adjuncts in epilepsy, not for acute management of status epilepticus.\n\nOption D (Inactivation of sodium channels) is incorrect because this mechanism is seen with drugs like phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproate. These drugs are used for long-term management of seizures, not for acute management of status epilepticus.\n\nOption E (Blockage of T-type calcium) is incorrect because this is the mechanism of action of ethosuximide, a drug used specifically for absence seizures."]},{"id":"item522","serial_num":5432,"text":["<strong>USMLE question:</strong> A vaccination campaign designed to increase the uptake of HPV vaccine was instituted in chosen counties of a certain state in order to educate parents not only about the disease itself, but also about why children should be vaccinated against this viral sexually transmitted disease.

Therefore, it is recommended to vaccinate these patients against these organisms at least two weeks prior to the surgery to allow for adequate development of protective immunity.\n\nThe appropriate timing of antibiotic prophylaxis with penicillin for these patients is less clearly defined, but it is generally started around the time of surgery. It is typically continued indefinitely in patients who have had a splenectomy, especially those older than age 50 or who have had their spleen removed due to a hematologic malignancy or other disorder (like ITP) that affects the immune system. \n\nThe other options are incorrect because they do not align with these recommendations.

HHS is characterized by severe hyperglycemia (>600 mg\/dL), hyperosmolality (>320 mOsm\/kg), and dehydration in the absence of significant ketoacidosis. The profound dehydration is a result of the severe hyperglycemia leading to glycosuria, osmotic diuresis, and eventually hypovolemia.

This condition is typically seen in post-partum women, especially those who are breastfeeding. However, lactational mastitis can also occur in women who are not breastfeeding, as is the case with this patient. The breast becomes engorged with milk that is not being expressed, leading to inflammation and mastitis. This is also known as \"milk stasis.\" The best way to treat this condition is to express the milk, which will relieve the engorgement and inflammation. Therefore, the best next step in management for this patient is breast pumping (Option 'A').\n\nAs for the other options, breastfeeding (Option 'B') could potentially alleviate the symptoms, but the patient has already chosen to feed her baby with formula. It would be inappropriate to ask the patient to change her feeding method. Oxacillin (Option 'C') and Vancomycin (Option 'E') are antibiotics and would be appropriate if the patient had an infection, but there is no indication of that in the case presented. The patient's symptoms are consistent with milk stasis, not infection. Finally, an ultrasound (Option 'D') could potentially be useful for diagnosing other breast conditions, but it is not necessary in this case because the patient's symptoms and history are strongly suggestive of lactational mastitis."]}]
