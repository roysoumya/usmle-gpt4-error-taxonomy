The most likely diagnosis for this patient is 'A': Deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state characterized by increased levels of procoagulant factors, decreased levels of natural anticoagulants, and decreased fibrinolysis. This, along with venous stasis due to the enlarging uterus, puts pregnant women at an increased risk for DVT. The clinical presentation is often unilateral leg swelling, pain, and erythema. Diagnosis is confirmed with duplex ultrasound, which shows a thrombus obstructing the blood flow.  'B': Erysipelas, is an acute bacterial skin infection typically caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. It is characterized by well-demarcated, raised borders and is usually accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever and chills.  'C': Erythema nodosum, is an inflammatory condition characterized by tender, erythematous nodules, usually on the anterior surface of the lower legs. It's not typically associated with swelling and does not cause vascular wall thickening.  'D': Varicose veins, are dilated, tortuous veins due to valvular incompetence. They do not typically present with pain, erythema, or a palpable cord.  'E': Superficial thrombophlebitis, is inflammation and thrombus formation in a superficial vein. Although similar to DVT, with tenderness and erythema along the course of the vein, the ultrasound in superficial thrombophlebitis would show a thrombus in a superficial vein, not in a deep vein as seen in this patient.

The answer is D: Testicular cancer.   The drug referred to in this question is colchicine, which is used to halt cell division during metaphase by inhibiting microtubule polymerization. Colchicine is most commonly known for its use in acute gouty arthritis as it helps to decrease inflammation and pain. However, it is also used in the treatment of testicular cancer (usually as part of a regimen with other chemotherapy drugs) due to its ability to inhibit rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells.  As for the other options:  A: Trichomonas vaginitis is an infection caused by a protozoan parasite and is typically treated with antibiotics like metronidazole or tinidazole, not with drugs that inhibit cell division.  B: While colchicine is used in the treatment of acute gouty arthritis, the question specifically refers to a use of the drug associated with stopping cell division, which is more relevant to its use in treating cancer.  C: Herpes zoster is treated with antiviral drugs such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir, not with drugs that inhibit cell division.  E: Polycythemia vera is a condition characterized by an increased number of red blood cells. It is often treated with phlebotomy or medications that decrease blood cell production (like hydroxyurea), not with drugs that inhibit cell division.

This patient's progressive dyspnea, chronic nonproductive cough, and smoking history are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), likely due to emphysema (given the absence of significant sputum production associated with chronic bronchitis). Emphysema is characterized by destruction of alveolar walls and loss of elastic recoil, which leads to air trapping and hyperinflation of the lungs. This often results in an increased residual volume (ie, the volume of air remaining in the lungs after forceful expiration).   Option B would be incorrect as the diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is typically decreased in restrictive lung diseases and certain conditions that decrease the surface area of the lungs (eg, emphysema), but is not primarily affected in this case of likely chronic bronchitis.  Option C would be incorrect as the FEV1/FVC ratio is usually decreased in obstructive lung diseases like COPD, not increased. This is because the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is disproportionately reduced due to airway obstruction.  Option D would be incorrect as a shift of the flow volume loop to the right is seen in restrictive lung diseases, not obstructive diseases like COPD.  Option E would be incorrect as lung compliance is typically increased in emphysema due to the destruction of alveolar walls. This is opposite to decreased lung compliance, which is seen in restrictive lung diseases. Therefore, the correct answer is 'A' - decreased lung residual volume.

The answer is A: Proximal tubule.  The clinical scenario indicates that the patient's calcium and magnesium levels have decreased, which suggests the use of a diuretic that can cause these changes by increasing their urinary loss. The only diuretic that predominantly acts on the proximal tubule and can cause hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia is the thiazide class of diuretics. These drugs inhibit the sodium-chloride symporter in the proximal tubule, leading to increased excretion of sodium and water. Concurrently, they also promote calcium reabsorption in the distal tubule, which usually leads to hypercalcemia, not hypocalcemia. However, in cases of long-term use or high dosages, thiazides can lead to hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia due to secondary hyperparathyroidism.  Option B (Descending loop of Henle) is incorrect because diuretics acting here (osmotic diuretics like mannitol) do not affect calcium and magnesium levels.  Option C (Thick ascending loop of Henle) is incorrect because the diuretics acting here (loop diuretics like furosemide) would cause hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia, but they are not typically used for hypertension.  Option D (Distal tubule) is incorrect because the diuretics acting here (thiazide diuretics) typically cause hypercalcemia, not hypocalcemia.   Option E (Cortical collecting duct) is incorrect because the diuretics acting here (potassium-sparing diuretics) do not affect calcium and magnesium levels.

This patient's lethargy, headache, nausea, and vomiting in the setting of high serum lactate and low serum bicarbonate are suggestive of salicylate toxicity. The other laboratory findings (respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis on arterial blood gas) can also be seen in salicylate toxicity. Salicylates uncouple oxidative phosphorylation, leading to increased metabolic rate, hyperpnea (ie, respiratory alkalosis), and lactate generation (ie, high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis). Excessive sweating from increased metabolism and vasodilation can cause the flushed skin seen in this patient.  Salicylates are present in many over-the-counter medications and are a common cause of overdose in children and adults. In older adults, they are often used at high doses for their anti-inflammatory effect in conditions such as arthritis. Aspirin, a salicylate, is also used as an analgesic to treat headaches, such as a tension headache (Choice C). The other conditions do not typically require treatment with salicylates.  The other options are incorrect because: - Alzheimer disease (Choice A) is usually treated with drugs like donepezil and memantine which do not cause similar symptoms. - Hypertensive crisis (Choice B) would be treated with antihypertensive drugs which again do not cause such symptoms. - Major depressive disorder (Choice D) would be managed with antidepressants, not causing a similar presentation. - Acute dystonia (Choice E) would be treated with antipsychotics or anticholinergic drugs, not causing a similar presentation.

The correct answer is B: Virus-specific immunoglobulins to remove free virus.  The primary immune response to viral infections such as influenza involves both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Initially, the innate immune response is activated, including natural killer cells and interferon production. However, these responses would not be enough to combat the virus.  The adaptive immune response, which involves the production of virus-specific immunoglobulins (Ig), is crucial for the clearance of the virus. In a primary infection like the scenario described, the body will take several days to produce these specific antibodies. These immunoglobulins, particularly IgM and IgG, will bind to the virus, preventing it from infecting cells and marking it for destruction by other immune cells.  Option A: Eosinophils are more commonly involved in parasitic infections and allergic reactions, not viral infections. Option C: The complement system can help in the clearance of viruses, but it's not the primary mechanism of action. Option D: Presentation of viral peptides on MHC-II of CD4+ T cells is part of the immune response to viruses, but it's a step towards stimulating B cells to produce antibodies rather than a direct antiviral mechanism. Option E: Natural killer cells do play a role in the immune response to viruses, but again, it's not the main mechanism for clearing the virus. They are part of the innate immune response and can kill virus-infected cells, but their action alone would not be sufficient to clear the infection.

The correct answer is 'D: Serum glucose concentration > 800 mg/dL'.  The symptoms described (polydipsia, polyuria, weight loss despite good appetite) are common presentations of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children. The elevated heart rate (tachycardia), increased respiratory rate (tachypnea), and lethargy suggest diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a potentially life-threatening complication of uncontrolled diabetes. DKA is characterised by hyperglycemia (blood glucose >250 mg/dL), ketosis, and metabolic acidosis.  The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:  'A: Increased arterial pCO2'- In DKA, the patient's respiratory system will try to compensate for the metabolic acidosis by blowing off CO2 (a process known as Kussmaul respiration), which can lead to a decrease in arterial pCO2, not an increase.  'B: Increased arterial blood pH' - DKA is a form of metabolic acidosis, which results in a decreased arterial blood pH.  'C: Excess water retention' - The polyuria and polydipsia seen in diabetes are due to osmotic diuresis, which results in a net loss of water, not water retention.  'E: Decreased total body potassium' - While it's true that DKA can lead to a total body potassium deficit (due to loss in the urine), the acidosis can cause a shift of potassium out of cells and into the bloodstream, potentially causing hyperkalemia. Therefore, the serum potassium level may be normal or even elevated, despite the total body potassium deficit.

The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is Dermal mast cell activation (Choice A). The lesion developed at the site of his recent immunization, suggesting that it's a local reaction to the vaccine. Vaccines can cause local inflammatory reactions at the injection site due to activation of the immune system. Mast cells, which reside in the skin, are part of the innate immune response and are one of the first responders to the vaccine. When activated, they degranulate and release histamine and other mediators that cause local vasodilation, edema, and recruitment of other immune cells. This leads to the clinical picture of a red, swollen, and sometimes painful area at the injection site.  Let's discuss why the other options are incorrect:  Choice B: Immune complex deposition is a mechanism of injury in some autoimmune diseases and certain infections, but it is not a typical response to vaccination.  Choice C: Intradermal acantholysis refers to the loss of connections between skin cells, leading to blistering. This is seen in conditions like pemphigus vulgaris, but it is not a typical response to vaccination.  Choice D: Infective dermal inflammation would suggest a secondary infection of the injection site, but this is less likely given the rapid onset of symptoms (the day after vaccination) and the lack of systemic symptoms like fever.  Choice E: T lymphocyte-mediated hypersensitivity can occur in response to certain drugs or in some autoimmune conditions, but it is typically a more delayed reaction. Also, you would expect to see more systemic symptoms if this were the case.

This patient's presentation of pruritus, jaundice, clay-colored stools (acholic stools), dark urine, weight loss, and abdominal mass along with lab findings of high alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels suggest obstructive jaundice due to cholangiocarcinoma (cancer of the bile ducts). Moreover, the presence of multifocal short segmental stenosis of the bile duct outside the liver and hypertrophy of the caudate lobe on CT scan are consistent with cholangiocarcinoma. The biopsy result showing periductal fibrosis with atypical bile duct cells in a desmoplastic stroma confirms the diagnosis. Cholangiocarcinomas are often associated with certain risk factors, including primary sclerosing cholangitis, choledochal cysts, chronic hepatitis C infection, and liver flukes (eg, Opisthorchis viverrini, Clonorchis sinensis). Given the patient's travel to Europe (where Clonorchis sinensis is endemic), the most likely predisposing factor is Option D: Liver fluke induced inflammation leading to metaplastic change.  Option A is incorrect. There is no evidence to suggest that contrast agents used in coronary angiography are associated with cholangiocarcinoma.  Option B is incorrect. Though chronic hepatitis, especially hepatitis C, can increase the risk of cholangiocarcinoma, this patient's serology is negative for hepatotropic viruses.  Option C is incorrect. While primary sclerosing cholangitis, which is characterized by idiopathic inflammatory scarring of the bile duct, is a major risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma, there's no history or evidence suggestive of such a condition in this patient.  Option E is incorrect. Choledochal cysts or abnormal cystic dilation of the biliary tree can predispose to cholangiocarcinoma but the CT scan does not show any cystic dilation in this patient.

This patient's fever, headache, fatigue, splenomegaly, atypical lymphocytosis, and negative heterophile antibody assay suggest infectious mononucleosis (IM) due to cytomegalovirus (CMV). IM is usually caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), in which case the monospot/heterophile antibody test is typically positive. However, about 10% of cases of IM are caused by CMV, and these patients would have a similar clinical presentation but a negative heterophile antibody test. CMV is usually a mild, asymptomatic infection in the immunocompetent host but can cause severe disease in the immunocompromised host, such as those with HIV/AIDS, organ transplant recipients, or patients on chronic immunosuppressive therapy. In the immunocompromised, CMV most commonly causes a retinitis characterized by "pizza pie appearance" on fundoscopic examination due to hemorrhage and exudates (option A). Other presentations include esophagitis with linear ulcers (option E), colitis, and less commonly, pneumonitis, encephalitis, and hepatitis.  Option A: Although CMV can cause neurologic disease in an immunocompromised host, it typically manifests as ventriculoencephalitis or polyradiculomyelopathy, rather than multiple cerebral abscesses. Option B: This option describes Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, which is rarely caused by CMV. Option C: Purplish skin nodules on the distal extremities are a presentation of Kaposi sarcoma, caused by human herpesvirus-8 rather than CMV. Option D: This option describes oral hairy leukoplakia, which is caused by EBV rather than CMV.

The most likely explanation for this patient's current presentation is 'C': Malignancy. This patient's clinical features of cough, weight loss, abdominal pain, hypercalcemia (increased Ca2+), and a history of poorly controlled GERD despite medical treatment are suggestive of an underlying malignancy. Some malignancies can cause paraneoplastic syndromes such as the production of a hormone related to parathyroid hormone (parathyroid hormone-related peptide), which can lead to hypercalcemia.   Option 'A': Increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) is incorrect as this would most likely present with symptoms of hypercalcemia such as constipation, depression, polyuria, and renal stones. There was no evidence of renal stones in her lab results.  Option 'B': Increased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is incorrect as this is unlikely to be the underlying cause given the patient's symptoms and demographics. This condition is more commonly seen in patients with granulomatous diseases like sarcoidosis, which does not align with her presentation.  Option 'D': Antacid overuse can lead to a condition known as milk-alkali syndrome characterized by hypercalcemia, renal failure, and metabolic alkalosis. However, this patient has normal renal function and no evidence of metabolic alkalosis, which makes this option less likely.  Option 'E': Viral illness is incorrect as her lab results and symptoms do not suggest an acute viral infection. Her weight loss, hypercalcemia, and poorly controlled GERD despite treatment are more in line with a chronic condition like malignancy rather than an acute viral illness.

The most appropriate next step in this patient's management is 'B' Endoscopy. Dysphagia to solids and liquids accompanied by progressive worsening of symptoms raises concern for a structural lesion such as esophageal cancer, hence the need for direct visualization and potential biopsy via endoscopy.  Option 'A', Barium swallow, is often used as a first-line diagnostic tool in patients with dysphagia, but given this patient's symptoms and the high suspicion of a structural lesion, an endoscopy is preferred due to its ability to directly visualize the esophagus and potentially biopsy any discovered lesions.  Option 'C', Manometry, measures pressures and the pattern of muscle contractions in the esophagus. It may be used when other tests are normal and the physician suspects a disorder of esophageal motility.  Option 'D', Myotomy, is a surgical procedure that may be used to treat achalasia, a condition that can also cause dysphagia. However, given this patient's presentation, there's no evidence to suggest that he has achalasia.  Option 'E', Nifurtimox, is an antiparasitic medication used to treat Trypanosoma cruzi infection (Chagas disease), which can cause dysphagia due to destruction of the myenteric plexus in the esophagus. However, this patient's presentation is more consistent with a structural lesion, such as a malignancy. While he did travel to South America, he doesn't have any other symptoms suggestive of Chagas disease, like heart failure or megacolon. Without more supporting evidence, it's premature to start treatment for Chagas disease.

The most appropriate next step in this case is 'C': PAP smear. The American Cancer Society, US Preventive Task Force, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that cervical cancer screening begin at age 21, regardless of sexual activity. However, sexually active adolescents should be screened for sexually transmitted infections, as they are at increased risk. This patient who uses condoms inconsistently should be regularly tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea using nucleic acid amplification testing, but not until age 21 unless there are symptoms or other risk factors (eg, multiple partners, partner with sexually transmitted infection).  The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:  Option 'A': Complete blood count - This is not relevant as the patient does not have any symptoms suggestive of a hematological disorder.  Option 'B': Nucleic acid amplification testing - This is used to test for chlamydia and gonorrhea, but it's not necessary until age 21 unless there are symptoms or other risk factors.  Option 'D': Rapid plasma reagin test - This is used to test for syphilis, which the patient does not have any symptoms or risk factors of.  Option 'E': Herpes simplex virus 2 serology - Routine screening for herpes is not recommended by the CDC for people without symptoms. It's best reserved for people with symptoms or those with a known exposure.

The lack of attached image makes it difficult to definitively diagnose this case. However, given the information, it seems like the boy might be suffering from contact dermatitis, particularly if the rash is localized to an area that could have come into contact with something while gardening. Contact dermatitis is a type of skin inflammation that is triggered by direct contact with a substance that the person is sensitive to. Common causes consist of soaps, cosmetics, fragrances, jewelry, and plants, such as poison ivy or poison oak.  The most appropriate treatment for contact dermatitis is topical corticosteroids, so the correct answer is 'D: Topical hydrocortisone.' These medications reduce inflammation and itchiness, helping the skin to heal.  Here's why the other options are less appropriate:  'A: Oral acitretin' is a medication primarily used for psoriasis and has serious side effects, so it would not be a first-line treatment for a simple contact dermatitis.  'B: Oral terbinafine' is an antifungal medication, and there is no indication in the scenario that the rash is due to a fungal infection.  'C: Topical clotrimazole' is also an antifungal agent. While gardening can expose one to fungal agents, the history provided does not strongly suggest a fungal infection.  'E: Topical salicylic acid' is primarily used to treat conditions like psoriasis, warts, and acne, not contact dermatitis.

This patient's DEXA scan showed a bone mineral density 2 standard deviations below the mean, indicating osteoporosis. Given her history of two hormone-sensitive cancers (breast and endometrial cancer), the most appropriate first-line treatment for osteoporosis in this patient would be a bisphosphonate, such as alendronate. Bisphosphonates work by attaching to hydroxyapatite binding sites on bony surfaces, especially those undergoing active resorption, and are thereby ingested by osteoclasts. The bisphosphonate compounds then induce osteoclast apoptosis, leading to decreased bone resorption and turnover (Choice C).   The other options all represent different treatments for osteoporosis. However, they would not be appropriate first-line therapies in this patient. Raloxifene (Choice A) is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that acts as an estrogen receptor agonist in bone. However, it acts as an estrogen receptor antagonist in breast and uterine tissue, making it a good choice for osteoporosis prevention in patients with a history of hormone-sensitive cancers (Choice B). Unfortunately, it is less effective than bisphosphonates at increasing bone mineral density and preventing fractures. Calcitonin (Choice D) is a hormone that can be used in osteoporosis to inhibit osteoclast activity, but it is less effective than other treatments and is not typically used as first-line therapy. Lastly, teriparatide (Choice E) is a recombinant form of parathyroid hormone that actually increases bone turnover and bone mineral density. However, it is only used in severe cases of osteoporosis or in patients who cannot tolerate other treatments due to its potential risk of osteosarcoma.

The correct answer is B. Cardiac troponins.  This patient's presentation of chest pain characterized as substernal and squeezing, associated with diaphoresis in the setting of recent percutaneous coronary intervention, is highly concerning for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The first diagnostic test in patients with suspected ACS is an ECG, ideally performed within 10 minutes of presentation. The purpose of this initial ECG is to identify ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), which requires immediate reperfusion therapy with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or, if PCI is not available, fibrinolytics. If the ECG does not show changes diagnostic of STEMI, the next step is to obtain cardiac biomarkers (eg, troponins).  Option A: Angiography is incorrect because although it might be the next step after ECG and troponins have confirmed an myocardial infarction, the troponins test is still needed to confirm the diagnosis.  Option C: Creatine kinase-MB is used as a cardiac biomarker, but troponins are preferred because they are more specific to cardiac muscle.  Option D: Myoglobin is a nonspecific marker and rises with any muscle injury, not just cardiac. It is also elevated in renal failure.   Option E: Stress testing is not performed in patients with a suspected acute coronary syndrome as it does not change immediate management and can potentially be dangerous.

The correct answer is C: Low X and high Y.  The researcher is studying the Michaelis-Menten kinetics of an enzyme. In this model, the maximum speed of the enzyme reaction is called Vmax (in the question, this is referred to as Y) and the substrate concentration at which the reaction is at half its maximum speed is called Km (in the question, this is referred to as X).   A high Vmax (Y) means that the enzyme can process a large amount of substrate in a given period of time. This implies that the enzyme is very efficient. Therefore, in the context of the Michaelis-Menten model, a high Vmax (Y) is desirable.   The Km (X) is inversely related to the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate. A low Km (X) means that the enzyme has a high affinity for its substrate, as it requires less substrate to reach half of its maximum speed. Therefore, a low Km (X) is also desirable in the context of the Michaelis-Menten model.  Options 'A' and 'B' imply a high Km (X), suggesting a low affinity of the enzyme for glucose. Option 'D' suggests an infinite Vmax (Y), which is theoretically impossible. Option 'E' suggests a low Vmax (Y), indicating a less efficient enzyme. Therefore, these options are incorrect.

This patient is likely suffering from gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), diagnosed based on elevated fasting and post-prandial blood glucose levels. The first line treatment for GDM after lifestyle modification is insulin therapy, which does not have a pharmacologic mechanism listed in the given options. When insulin is not preferred or not available, glyburide, an oral hypoglycemic agent, is used next. Glyburide works by opening ATP-dependent K+ channels in the beta cells of the pancreas (option E). This causes cell membrane depolarization and subsequent insulin release.  Option A - Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase 4: This is the mechanism for gliptins used in type 2 diabetes, not gestational diabetes.  Option B - Binding of tyrosine kinase receptors: This is the mechanism for insulin and insulin-like growth factor, but it is not applicable here as no directly acting insulin analogue is discussed.  Option C - Inhibition of alpha-glucosidase: This is the mechanism for acarbose and miglitol, which are used for postprandial hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes. However, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are not typically used in pregnancy due to lack of safety data.  Option D - Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma: This is the mechanism for thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) used in type 2 diabetes, not gestational diabetes. Moreover, these drugs are generally avoided during pregnancy due to potential fetal toxicity.

The correct statement related to the diagnosis of this patient is: 'C: Gait ataxia in this condition is a pure sensory ataxia'.   The patient's symptoms and the result of the genetic testing indicate that he has Friedreich's ataxia, a rare genetic disease that causes difficulty walking, a loss of sensation in the arms and legs, and impaired speech. This condition is caused by an expansion of GAA trinucleotide repeats in the frataxin gene on chromosome 9. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, not dominant, which eliminates option 'E'.   Patients with Friedreich's ataxia usually present with gait ataxia, which is primarily of sensory origin due to the degeneration of the dorsal columns and spinocerebellar tracts. Hence, the ataxia in this condition can be correctly referred to as a 'pure sensory ataxia'.   Option 'A' is wrong because horizontal, not vertical, nystagmus is typically seen in patients with this condition. Option 'B' is incorrect because although heart disease is a common cause of death in those with Friedreich's ataxia, it is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, not restrictive cardiomyopathy, that is commonly seen.   Finally, option 'D' is wrong because the mutated gene in Friedreich's ataxia is located on chromosome 9q13-q21.1, not just chromosome 9. So, it's location is more specific than merely chromosome 9.

The most likely cause of this patient's visual defects is 'A': Bilateral uncal herniation.   In the context of head trauma in a patient presenting with the worst headache of life, a likely diagnosis is hemorrhage leading to increased intracranial pressure and herniation. The description of visual problems with double vision when looking to the sides is consistent with bilateral dysfunction of cranial nerve VI (abducens nerve), which innervates the lateral rectus muscle of the eye and is responsible for lateral gaze. The abducens nerves travel along the base of the brain and are susceptible to injury from increased intracranial pressure, specifically in the case of uncal herniation, where the medial part of the temporal lobes (the uncus) herniates downward, compressing the brainstem and cranial nerves. When both sides are affected, it is called bilateral uncal herniation.  'B': Central herniation, 'C': Subfalcine herniation, 'D': Tonsillar herniation, and 'E': Unilateral uncal herniation are less likely to cause the bilateral eye movement abnormalities described in this patient. Central herniation involves downward displacement of the brain due to generalized brain swelling, and generally causes a decreased level of consciousness before causing ocular symptoms. Subfalcine herniation involves displacement of part of the frontal lobe under the falx cerebri, causing localized pressure effects. Tonsillar herniation involves downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum, causing brainstem compression and symptoms like loss of consciousness, respiratory depression and neck stiffness. Unilateral uncal herniation would typically cause symptoms on one side, not both.

The correct answer is B: Essential hypertension.  Ischemic colitis is the most common form of intestinal ischemia. It is a condition characterized by reduced blood flow to the colon, leading to inflammation and injury. Some conditions predispose individuals to ischemic colitis, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension. In this case, essential hypertension (option B) is the most likely predisposing factor for this patient's ischemic colitis. Hypertension can lead to atherosclerosis, which can cause narrowing or blockage of the arteries supplying the colon, leading to ischemia.  Option A is not correct because increased splanchnic blood flow following a large meal would not predispose to ischemic colitis. In fact, increased blood flow would be more likely to prevent ischemia.  Option C is also not correct because obstruction of the abdominal aorta following surgery, while it could lead to ischemia of the intestines, is a less likely cause of ischemic colitis in this patient without a stated history of abdominal aortic surgery.  Option D, hyperreninemic hyperaldosteronism secondary to type II diabetes mellitus, would lead to hypertension but is a less common condition than essential hypertension.  Option E, juxtaglomerular cell tumor, is a rare cause of hypertension. While any form of hypertension could theoretically predispose to ischemic colitis, essential hypertension is more common and therefore more likely in this patient.

Option B: Sciatic nerve.   The patient's presentation of cramps in her left leg along with increased muscle tone in the thigh muscles suggests spasticity, a common symptom in multiple sclerosis. Spasticity, or increased muscle tone, can result in spasms, stiffness, and pain. The sciatic nerve, the largest nerve in the body, provides innervation to most of the lower leg and foot. By blocking the sciatic nerve, the muscle tone may decrease, thereby relieving the patient's symptoms.  As for the other options:  Option A: The obturator nerve primarily innervates the medial compartment of the thigh, which includes the adductor muscles. It wouldn't likely be involved with the patient's symptoms.  Option C: The inferior gluteal nerve innervates the gluteus maximus muscle, which is mainly responsible for hip extension and external rotation. Blocking this nerve wouldn't likely address the symptoms in the thigh.  Option D: The femoral nerve innervates the anterior compartment of the thigh, including the quadriceps. However, the patient's symptoms seem to be more generalized rather than specific to the anterior thigh.  Option E: The superior gluteal nerve innervates the gluteus medius and minimus and tensor fasciae latae muscles, which are involved in hip abduction and internal rotation. Blocking this nerve wouldn't likely have a significant effect on the patient's symptoms.

The most likely underlying cause of this patient's fracture is 'C': Interrupted vascular supply.  In elderly individuals, especially those with comorbidities such as hypertension, the vascular supply to certain areas of the body can become compromised. The femoral neck is one such area that has a relatively poor blood supply, making it susceptible to fractures, particularly in the setting of a fall. The limited blood supply to this area can also lead to slow healing and potential complications such as avascular necrosis.   Option 'A': Reduced osteoblastic activity and 'D': Impaired bone mineralization are typically associated with osteoporosis, a condition characterized by low bone mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue. However, this patient's normal serum creatinine and lack of other risk factors for osteoporosis (such as smoking, excessive alcohol intake, and postmenopausal status) make this less likely.  Option 'B': Monoclonal antibody production is associated with multiple myeloma, a cancer of plasma cells that can cause lytic bone lesions and increase fracture risk. However, there is no indication that this patient has multiple myeloma.  Option 'E': Defective osteoclast function is associated with conditions such as osteopetrosis, in which there is increased bone density due to impaired bone resorption. This would not lead to increased fracture risk but rather might make bones more brittle and prone to certain types of fractures. However, this is a rare condition and there is no evidence to suggest it in this patient.

The baby likely has a 'Catlike cry' (option B). The clinical features described in this question are consistent with DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome), which is characterized by cardiac defects, abnormal facial features (like cleft palate, low-set ears, and micrognathia), thymic aplasia leading to a deficiency of T cells, and hypocalcemia. In some cases, affected infants may have a distinctive, high-pitched cry that has been described as similar to the mewing of a cat.  Option A is incorrect because seizures are not a characteristic feature of DiGeorge syndrome. They could potentially occur due to severe hypocalcemia, but this is not specific to DiGeorge syndrome and can occur in any condition that causes severe hypocalcemia.  Option C is incorrect because hyperthyroidism is not a feature of DiGeorge syndrome. The thyroid is typically unaffected in this disorder.  Option D is incorrect because webbing of the neck is a feature of Turner syndrome, not DiGeorge syndrome. Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects females and is characterized by short stature, webbed neck, broad chest with widely spaced nipples, and gonadal dysgenesis.  Option E is incorrect because increased phenylalanine in the blood is a characteristic feature of phenylketonuria (PKU), not DiGeorge syndrome. PKU is a metabolic disorder in which the body is unable to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine, leading to its accumulation in the blood.

The most appropriate next step for this patient is D, Symptomatic treatment. This patient's presentation of an acute sore throat, fever, and anterior cervical lymphadenopathy is suggestive of viral pharyngitis, the most common cause of pharyngitis. It is also important to note that the absence of cough, rhinorrhea, or conjunctivitis does not rule out viral pharyngitis. A physical examination of a patient with viral pharyngitis may reveal inflamed tonsils without exudates, and tender, enlarged anterior cervical lymph nodes. The treatment of viral pharyngitis is symptomatic, including rest, hydration, and analgesics (eg, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) as needed.  Option A, Antibiotics, are not indicated because this patient's presentation is more consistent with viral pharyngitis than bacterial (eg, Streptococcus pyogenes). Unnecessary use of antibiotics should be avoided due to side effects and the potential for developing resistance.  Option B, Rapid strep test, and Option C, Strep culture, would be considered if the clinical presentation was suggestive of streptococcal pharyngitis (eg, sore throat, fever, tonsillar exudates, and tender cervical adenopathy without cough). However, the absence of tonsillar exudate in this patient makes this diagnosis less likely.  Option E, Ultrasound of neck, would be appropriate if there was concern for an abscess or other anatomic abnormalities, which this patient's presentation does not suggest.

The correct answer is 'D': Decreased pulmonary vascular resistance.  When people live at high altitudes, their bodies adapt to the lower oxygen levels in several ways. One of these is by decreasing pulmonary vascular resistance. This is achieved by increasing the diameter of the blood vessels in the lungs, which reduces the resistance to blood flow and allows more oxygen to be picked up by the red blood cells.  The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:  'A': Decreased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration would actually impair oxygen-carrying capacity as it refers to the average concentration of hemoglobin in a given volume of blood. Living at high altitudes typically prompts the body to produce more red blood cells and thus more hemoglobin, not less.  'B': Decreased red blood cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) would impair oxygen delivery to tissues. Increased levels of 2,3-DPG actually enhance oxygen delivery by promoting the release of oxygen from hemoglobin in the peripheral tissues. Chronic exposure to high altitudes is associated with increased 2,3-DPG.  'C': Decreased oxygen binding ability of hemoglobin would mean that less oxygen can be carried in the blood, which would be disadvantageous in a low-oxygen environment. At high altitudes, the body adapts to increase the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen.  'E': Decreased renal erythropoietin production would result in fewer red blood cells, reducing the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity. In response to low oxygen levels, the kidneys actually increase erythropoietin production to stimulate the production of more red blood cells.

This patient's chronic hemolytic anemia, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and diabetes mellitus suggest a diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis, which is characterized by a mutation resulting in increased iron absorption (choice D).   Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder commonly seen in patients of Northern European descent, but it can also occur in other ethnicities. Patients with this condition have a mutation in the HFE gene, which leads to increased intestinal absorption of dietary iron. Over time, the excess iron accumulates in various organs (eg, heart, liver, pancreas, joints), leading to organ damage. Symptoms typically begin in the middle age and include fatigue, arthritis, and diabetes mellitus (bronze diabetes), as seen in this patient. The skin may also darken ("bronze") due to iron deposition and increased melanin.  Option A (Alpha Thalassemia) and option B (Beta Thalassemia) are incorrect. Both are inherited disorders causing a deficiency in the production of hemoglobin chains, leading to a microcytic, hypochromic anemia, but neither is associated with iron overload.   Option C (Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin) is also incorrect. It is a benign condition characterized by the continued production of fetal hemoglobin after birth. It does not lead to iron overload or the clinical features seen in this patient.  Option E (Wilson disease) is incorrect as even though it does lead to hepatic disease due to copper accumulation and can have extrapyramidal symptoms, it does not cause the restrictive cardiomyopathy or diabetes mellitus seen in this patient.

This patient's progressive muscle weakness, calf pseudohypertrophy, and Gower sign (difficulty standing from a seated position) is suggestive of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). DMD is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by a progressive decline in muscle strength, starting with the proximal lower limb muscles. It is typically diagnosed in boys 3-5 years of age. DMD is caused by a mutation in the dystrophin gene, which helps maintain the structural integrity of muscle. The most common type of mutation seen in DMD is a frameshift mutation (option E), leading to an absence of the dystrophin protein.  Now let's discuss why the other options are incorrect:  A: Nonsense mutations (option A) usually result in a premature stop codon, which can cause a wide variety of genetic diseases, but DMD is most commonly associated with frameshift mutations.  B: Missense mutations (option B) result in a single nucleotide change that codes for a different amino acid. This could result in a wide variety of diseases, but is not the typical cause of DMD.  C: Trinucleotide repeat expansions (option C) are the cause of diseases like Huntington's disease and fragile X syndrome, not DMD.  D: Splice site mutations (option D) can cause a variety of diseases by disrupting the normal splicing of exons, but DMD is most commonly associated with frameshift mutations.

The physician is trying to increase 'A': IgG antibodies in the college student as a result of the vaccination.  Explanation: IgG is the most abundant type of antibody and is found in all bodily fluids. It provides long-term protection against most pathogens, as it is the only antibody that can cross the placenta, providing passive immunity to the fetus during pregnancy. IgG antibodies are produced in a secondary immune response, which is what occurs following vaccination. The goal of vaccination is to trigger an immune response so that the body will recognize and quickly respond to the pathogen in the future, and this response is largely mediated by IgG antibodies.  Reasons for incorrect choices: B: IgA antibodies are found in areas of the body such as the nose, breathing passages, digestive tract, ears, eyes, and vagina. IgA antibodies protect body surfaces that are exposed to outside foreign substances.  C: IgM antibodies are the first antibodies to be produced in response to an initial exposure to an antigen. They are primarily found in the blood and lymph fluid.  D: IgD's function isnât very well known, but it is believed to play a role in the activation and suppression of B cell responses.  E: IgE antibodies are associated with allergic reactions and parasitic infections. They are found in the lungs, skin, and mucous membranes.

Without visual cues, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer. However, based on the information given, the most likely diagnosis is A) Infectious mononucleosis, also known as mono or the "kissing disease".  Infectious mononucleosis (EBV infection) is often characterized by a few days of prodromal sore throat, fever, and malaise followed by the onset of a diffuse rash. Administration of aminopenicillins (eg, ampicillin, amoxicillin) to patients with infectious mononucleosis typically results in development of a maculopapular rash (90% of cases) that can be mistaken for an allergic reaction.  Option B) Kawasaki disease typically presents with fever, rash, conjunctivitis, and lymphadenopathy, but it also usually involves changes to the mucous membranes and extremities, including red, cracked lips, strawberry tongue, and redness or swelling of the hands and feet.  Option C) Rheumatic fever is a complication of untreated group A Streptococcus infection, but it typically presents with migratory arthritis, carditis, and other symptoms not mentioned in the stem.  Option D) Scarlet fever, caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, typically presents with a sandpaper-like rash and strawberry tongue, but the rash usually starts on the chest and spreads, sparing the palms and soles.  Option E) Urticaria (hives) is an allergic reaction that causes raised, red, itchy welts on the skin. It can be caused by many factors, including allergic reactions to medications, but the rash's description as "coarse" does not fit with this diagnosis.

The symptoms of this patient suggest a possible intracranial mass. The patient has been experiencing morning vomiting (which generally improves throughout the day) and occasional headaches, which are typical symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Additionally, examination revealed a mild narrowing of the visual fields, which may suggest the presence of a space-occupying lesion, such as a tumor, pressing on the optic chiasm. Therefore, the answer is 'D': Intracerebellar mass.  As for the other options:  Option A, 'Non-enveloped, (+) ssRNA virus,' could refer to a variety of viruses, including norovirus or rotavirus, which cause gastroenteritis. Though the patient did have diarrhea and vomiting, the persistent and especially morning vomiting along with the visual changes are not typical for gastroenteritis.  Option B, 'Gram-negative microaerophilic bacteria,' could refer to Helicobacter pylori, which causes peptic ulcer disease. However, this presentation is unlikely in a child and the patient's other symptoms do not fit this diagnosis.  Option C, 'Gram-positive enterotoxin,' could refer to something like staphylococcal food poisoning, but this would not explain the visual changes or the pattern of morning vomiting.  Option E, "Remnant of Rathke's pouch," could cause a pituitary tumor, which could cause visual field defects. However, this would typically also be associated with endocrine abnormalities, which aren't mentioned in this scenario.

The patient's initial symptoms and low TSH are consistent with hyperthyroidism, likely from subacute (de Quervain) thyroiditis given her recent viral infection. Subacute thyroiditis typically involves a hyperthyroid phase that lasts 2-6 weeks, followed by a hypothyroid phase that can last up to 3 months before eventual return to a euthyroid state.  In this patient, the initial hyperthyroidism was treated with propranolol for symptom control (e.g., palpitations, tremors) and propylthiouracil to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis. However, on follow-up, her elevated TSH is consistent with the expected transition to hypothyroidism. Propylthiouracil is no longer needed and may even be harmful in this phase as it may further decrease thyroid hormone production and worsen symptoms. In symptomatic patients like this one who present with severe fatigue, the best next step in management is a short course of levothyroxine (T4) (Choice C).  Choices A and B are incorrect as this patient's hypothyroid symptoms are likely due to the natural course of subacute thyroiditis rather than over-treatment with medications. Choice D would also be incorrect as liothyronine (T3) has a shorter half-life than levothyroxine (T4) and can cause more side effects due to fluctuating serum levels. Choice E would also not be ideal, as although discontinuing propylthiouracil is necessary, this patient's severe fatigue would benefit from the addition of levothyroxine.

The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is 'A': Deficiency in a coagulation factor.  The boy's prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) suggests a defect in the intrinsic or common coagulation pathway. The fact that mixing studies did not correct the PTT indicates that the cause is likely a deficiency in a factor, as opposed to an inhibitor (which would have been corrected by the addition of normal plasma). This, along with the history of easy bruising, suggests hemophilia, a X-linked recessive disorder that typically presents in male children with excessive bleeding or bruising.  'B': Deficiency of von Willebrand factor would present with a prolonged bleeding time and possibly a mildly elevated PTT, which is not the case here.  'C': Platelet defect is unlikely because the bleeding time, which is most reflective of platelet function, is normal.  'D': Production of an autoantibody, such as in acquired hemophilia or lupus anticoagulant, would cause a prolonged PTT that corrects with a mixing study, which is not the case here.  'E': Warfarin toxicity is unlikely because it usually presents with a prolonged PT, not PTT. Warfarin acts to inhibit the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, which are primarily tested with PT.

This patient has findings that suggest coarctation of the aorta. Coarctation of the aorta is a congenital heart defect characterized by a narrowing of the descending aorta, typically just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. This results in hypertension due to increased afterload and increased left ventricular work, as well as a disparity in pressures (and blood flow) between the upper and lower extremities. Clinical findings include hypertension with decreased blood pressure in the lower extremities and delayed or weaker femoral pulses compared to the brachial or radial pulses. A systolic murmur may be heard best over the left infraclavicular area or between the shoulder blades in the back, due to increased flow through the intercostal and scapular arteries as blood is shunted around the coarctation. Therefore, the correct answer is Option C.  Option A is incorrect as a mid-systolic murmur loudest at the right second intercostal space, with radiation to the right neck, is characteristic of aortic stenosis. Option B is incorrect as a holodiastolic murmur loudest at the apex, with an opening snap following the S2 heart sound, is suggestive of mitral stenosis. Option D is incorrect as a continuous, machine-like murmur at the left infraclavicular area is typical of patent ductus arteriosus. Option E is incorrect as a right supraclavicular continuous murmur which disappears with pressure on the internal jugular vein is suggestive of venous hum, not a structural heart defect.

The correct answer is A: Prospective cohort study.  A prospective cohort study involves identifying patients according to their exposure status (in this case, cocaine use), then following them over time to see if they develop the disease of interest (in this case, syphilis). The exposed and unexposed groups are compared to see if there's a difference in disease rates.  Option B is incorrect because a case-control study involves identifying cases (people with the disease) and controls (people without the disease) then looking backwards in time to see if there's a difference in exposure rates. This is the opposite of the study described.  Option C is incorrect because a meta-analysis involves combining the results from multiple individual studies to get a more reliable estimate of the effect of an exposure on a disease. It doesn't involve collecting primary data.  Option D is incorrect because a cross-sectional study involves measuring the exposure and disease status at the same point in time. It doesn't involve following people over time.  Option E is incorrect because a retrospective cohort study involves identifying people according to their exposure status then looking backwards in time to see if they developed the disease. The study described in the question is following people forward in time, so it's a prospective rather than retrospective cohort study.

The correct answer is A: Short gastric arteries.  The short gastric arteries supply the upper part of the greater curvature of the stomach, where sleeve gastrectomy is typically started. These arteries originate directly from the splenic artery or its branches and are responsible for vascularizing the fundus and upper body of the stomach.  Option B: The splenic artery does not directly supply the stomach; instead, it gives off several branches, including the short gastric arteries, that supply the stomach.  Option C: The right gastric artery usually originates from the common hepatic artery (a branch of the celiac trunk) and runs along the lesser curvature of the stomach. Therefore, it would not supply the greater curvature of the stomach where the incision is made during a sleeve gastrectomy.  Option D: The right gastroepiploic artery (also known as the right gastro-omental artery) does supply the greater curvature of the stomach. However, it supplies the lower part of the greater curvature, not the upper part (or right half) where the surgical incision for a sleeve gastrectomy is usually made.  Option E: The right gastroduodenal artery does not supply the stomach directly. It gives off two branches: the anterior and posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal arteries. These supply the first part of the duodenum and the pancreas, not the stomach.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is cutaneous larva migrans (Option B). This patient's presentation of intensely pruritic and linear papules, especially after recent travel to a tropical location (Miami, in this case), is characteristic of cutaneous larva migrans. This condition is caused by the larvae of dog or cat hookworms (Ancylostoma species) that are present in contaminated soil or sand. Larvae penetrate the skin and migrate, causing serpiginous, pruritic tracks.  Option A, Scabies, presents with intense pruritus, especially at night, along with erythematous papules and burrows in interdigital spaces, wrists, axillae, and the belt line, which is not seen in this patient.  Option C, Bed bug bites, typically present as pruritic, erythematous wheals that follow a linear or clustered distribution, frequently on the face, neck, hands, or arms. The history often includes recent travel or exposure to infested bedding or furniture, which is not mentioned in this case.  Option D, Spider bites, often present as a singular bite with a halo or target-like appearance, and systemic symptoms can occur depending on the species.  Option E, Flea bites, usually occur on the lower legs and feet, and are characterized by small, itchy, red bumps surrounded by a halo. Flea bites are often grouped in clusters or lines of two bites, and not a linear line of papules.

The most likely cause of this patient's neurological symptoms is an embolic cerebrovascular accident, also known as a stroke (option D). The reason being, she was diagnosed with a large saddle embolus in the pulmonary arteries, and although emergency treatment helped to dissolve the thrombus, it's possible that part of it broke off and traveled to the brain.   The symptoms she is showing, including decreased consciousness, dysarthia (slurred speech), and optic disc swelling, are common in strokes. Optic disc swelling (papilledema) can be caused by increased intracranial pressure, which can occur in cerebrovascular accidents.  As for the other options:  Option A (Acute metabolic encephalopathy) is unlikely because there's no indication of metabolic imbalance such as liver or kidney failure, hypoglycemia, or electrolyte imbalances.  Option B (Idiopathic intracranial hypertension) is unlikely since it typically presents with headache, transient visual obscurations or vision loss, not a decrease in consciousness or slurred speech.   Option C (Drug-induced hypotension) could cause altered consciousness if it's severe, but it wouldn't typically cause dysarthria or optic disc swelling.  Option E (Intracerebral hemorrhage) could potentially cause these symptoms, but it's less likely than a stroke given the patient's recent history of a large pulmonary embolus.  So, based on the patient's history and symptoms, an embolic cerebrovascular accident is the most likely cause.

The correct answer is B: 'The causative organism is Candida albicans'.   A complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is one that occurs in a patient with a structural or functional abnormality of the urinary tract that may interfere with normal urinary flow or voiding and predispose to persistent or recurrent infection or treatment failure. This can include factors such as urinary retention, urinary tract stones (nephrolithiasis), urinary tract obstruction, renal insufficiency, immunosuppression, or the presence of an indwelling urinary catheter.   Patients with diabetes, like this woman, are also at increased risk for complicated UTIs due to factors such as glucose in the urine that can facilitate bacterial growth and impaired host immune response. UTIs caused by atypical organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is seen typically in hospital-acquired infections, are also generally considered complicated because they may be associated with underlying urinary tract abnormalities and are often resistant to first-line antibiotics.  However, the mere presence of an atypical organism, such as Candida albicans, does not in itself define a UTI as complicated. Candida species are not commonly involved in uncomplicated UTIs, but they may cause UTIs in patients with other predisposing risk factors such as immunosuppression or an indwelling urinary catheter. Nonetheless, the organism itself does not dictate whether a UTI is categorized as complicated or uncomplicated, but rather the underlying conditions that predispose to infection. Therefore, the answer is option B.

The correct answer is 'D': Obtain an ethics consult.  The patient is a Jehovah's Witness, and it is known that they may refuse blood transfusions. The patient's ex-husband also mentioned the patient's possible refusal. However, the patient herself is in a critical condition and unable to speak, hence, cannot acknowledge her medical wishes. Therefore, given the life-threatening nature of the patient's condition and the complexity of the situation, an ethics consult should be obtained as soon as possible.   Option 'A': Providing transfusions as needed, may violate the patientâs autonomy and specific religious beliefs if she indeed would refuse a blood transfusion.   Option 'B': Asking ex-husband to bring identification to the trauma bay, does not resolve the issue of the patientâs wishes about blood transfusion.   Option 'C': Withholding transfusion based on ex-husband's request, would be appropriate if he was a current spouse and had legally recognized decision-making authority for the patient, but in this case he does not.   Option 'E': Obtaining a court order for transfusion, would be time-consuming and it may not be feasible in an emergency situation. Also, a court would not typically intervene in such cases due to respect for autonomy and religious freedom.

This patient's exertional symptoms (chest tightness, shortness of breath, lightheadedness) and physical examination findings (late systolic ejection murmur heard best in the third right intercostal space) are suggestive of aortic stenosis (AS). AS typically presents in older adults with long-standing hypertension or bicuspid aortic valve. The pathophysiology of symptoms in AS is primarily due to narrowing of the aortic valve lumen, which increases left ventricular afterload and myocardial oxygen demand. This leads to myocardial hypertrophy and eventual left ventricular failure with symptoms of shortness of breath.  Option A ('Inflammatory constriction of the bronchioles') is incorrect as the patient's lungs are clear to auscultation, which makes a respiratory cause like asthma unlikely.  Option C ('Cellular injury of the esophageal epithelium') is incorrect as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a gastrointestinal condition like gastroesophageal reflux disease.  Option D ('Critical transmural hypoperfusion of the myocardium') is incorrect as this would suggest myocardial infarction, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.   Option E ('Increased left ventricular oxygen demand') is incorrect as it is a result of the AS, rather than the primary cause of the patient's condition.  Therefore, the correct answer is B ('Narrowing of the coronary arterial lumen').

This patient's history of recurrent sore throat and fever during childhood followed by migratory polyarthritis suggests a history of acute rheumatic fever, a sequel of group A Streptococcus infections. This disease can cause carditis, which may lead to chronic rheumatic heart disease (RHD), the most common cause of mitral stenosis. The most common presentation of mitral stenosis is dyspnea on exertion, palpitations, and orthopnea, which are symptoms of left-sided heart failure. The murmur of mitral stenosis is best heard at the apex of the heart (mitral area), which corresponds to point 4 in the auscultation sites. Therefore, the correct answer is 'D': Point 4.   Point 1 (the 2nd right intercostal space) is the auscultation point of the aortic valve. Point 2 (the 2nd left intercostal space) is the auscultation point of the pulmonary valve. Point 3 (the 3rd left intercostal space) is the auscultation point of Erb's point, where the S2 heart sound is best heard. Point 5 (the 5th intercostal space in the midclavicular line) is the point of maximal impulse (PMI) and is not typically used for auscultation of specific valves.   All these other points are not directly related to the patient's disease history and current presentation. Therefore, these options are wrong.

The most likely explanation for this patient's glucosuria is option B: 'Decreased SGLT2 expression'.  During pregnancy, the kidneys increase their filtration rate due to increased blood volume and metabolic demand of the growing fetus. Sodium-glucose cotransporters (SGLT) in the proximal tubule, especially SGLT2, reabsorb the majority of the filtered glucose. As the glomerular filtration rate increases, the amount of glucose filtered exceeds the reabsorptive capacity of the proximal tubule, resulting in glucosuria. This is a normal physiological adaptation to pregnancy and does not imply gestational diabetes, which is typically diagnosed with a glucose tolerance test.  Option A, 'Decreased insulin production', is incorrect because insulin production actually increases during pregnancy to compensate for increased insulin resistance. This patient's non-fasting glucose level is within the normal range, suggesting that her insulin production is adequate.  Option C, 'Increased glomerular filtration barrier permeability', is incorrect because changes in the filtration barrier's permeability do not occur in normal pregnancy and would result in proteinuria, not glucosuria.  Option D, 'Decreased insulin sensitivity', is incorrect because, while insulin resistance does increase during pregnancy as a normal physiological adaptation, this patient's non-fasting glucose level is within the normal range, suggesting that her insulin sensitivity is adequate.  Option E, 'Increased glomerular filtration rate', is incorrect because, while the glomerular filtration rate does increase during pregnancy, this alone would not lead to glucosuria. Glucosuria occurs when the amount of glucose filtered exceeds the reabsorptive capacity of the proximal tubule, which is related to SGLT2 expression.

The correct answer is E - Generalized dense, sclerotic bone.  The patient's presentation of increased skull size and bone pain, as well as hearing loss and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, is suggestive of Paget's disease of bone. This is a disorder of the bone remodeling process that leads to enlarged and misshapen bones. The skull, pelvis, spine, and long bones are typically affected. Radiologic findings in Paget's disease show a mixed picture in the early stages, with both lytic and sclerotic areas. However, as the disease progresses, it becomes dominated by sclerosis as seen in this patient, leading to a generalized increase in bone density (option E).  Option A - Lytic lesions with no sclerotic margin - is typically seen in metastatic cancer, not Paget's disease.  Option B - Multiple, well-defined, punched out lytic lesions - are more characteristic of multiple myeloma.  Option C - Mixed lytic and sclerotic lesions - are seen in the early stages of Paget's disease, but as mentioned, the disease progresses to a primarily sclerotic phase.  Option D - Periosteal trabeculations with radiolucent marrow hyperplasia - is indicative of osteopetrosis, a rare genetic disorder characterized by the body's inability to form mature bone tissue. This leads to overly dense, but brittle and easily broken bones. The history and clinical picture provided doesn't fit with this diagnosis.

The most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is 'D': Compression of neurovascular structures in the neck.  This patient's symptoms of arm heaviness and paresthesias, lightheadedness, nausea, blurred vision, and diminished radial and brachial pulses in the right upper extremity are suggestive of subclavian steal syndrome. This condition occurs when there is a stenosis or occlusion of the proximal subclavian artery, usually secondary to atherosclerosis. The resultant proximal blood flow obstruction leads to retrograde flow in the ipsilateral vertebral artery to supply the arm, 'stealing' blood from the vertebrobasilar system. This diversion of blood flow can cause vertebrobasilar insufficiency with resultant symptoms such as dizziness/lightheadedness, visual disturbances, and imbalance.  Option 'A': Adverse effect of medications is incorrect because although some of the medications the patient is taking may have side effects, none of them would create these symptoms.  Option 'B': Reversed blood flow in the right vertebral artery is partially correct, as this is a mechanism of subclavian steal syndrome, but it is the result of the primary pathologic process, not the cause.  Option 'C': Non-enzymatic glycosylation of peripheral nerve is often seen in diabetic patients and may cause peripheral neuropathy, but it would not cause the decreased radial and brachial pulses and cooler skin seen in this patient.  Option 'E': Infarction of the middle cerebral artery would have more focal neurologic findings, such as weakness, speech, or sensory abnormalities. It also would not explain the lack of pulse and cool skin in the arm.

The answer is C, chromosome 17.   The patient is presenting with multiple colorectal adenomas which is suggestive of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP). FAP is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene which is located on chromosome 17. FAP is characterized by the development of hundreds to thousands of adenomatous polyps in the colon and rectum during the second decade of life. If left untreated, there is an almost 100% chance of developing colon cancer by the fifth decade of life.  Option 'A' is incorrect because chromosome 5 is involved in familial adenomatous polyposis, but this is usually in conjunction with a mutation on chromosome 15.  Option 'B' is incorrect as chromosome 7 is related to cystic fibrosis. Option 'D' is incorrect because chromosome 19 is associated with familial hypercholesterolemia. Option 'E' is incorrect as the X chromosome is associated with many X-linked disorders including hemophilia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.   Also, it is important to note that Alzheimer's disease, which is present in the patient's grandfather, is more commonly associated with mutations in the APOE gene on chromosome 19, not the APC gene on chromosome 17. Although Alzheimer's disease has been associated with mutations in other genes, it is not typically associated with FAP.

The patient's presentation of intense pain, redness, and swelling at the first metatarsophalangeal joint is suggestive of acute gouty arthritis. This is a common condition in middle-aged men who consume diets rich in purines, such as red meat. It is also associated with thiazide diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide. Initial pharmacologic treatment usually includes a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), corticosteroids, or colchicine. In this patient, the best treatment option would be oral methylprednisolone and meloxicam (Option B).  Let's discuss why the other options are not ideal:  Option A: Probenecid is a uricosuric drug used in chronic gout to increase the urinary excretion of uric acid. It should not be used in acute gout.  Option C: Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is used for the long-term management of gout to decrease uric acid production. However, it should not be initiated during an acute gout attack as it can potentially worsen the attack.  Option D: While colchicine is used for acute gout, the combination with celecoxib (a type of NSAID) isn't typically recommended due to increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects.  Option E: While NSAIDs alone can be used for acute gout, the use of diclofenac alone might not provide sufficient relief for severe cases. Adding a corticosteroid like methylprednisolone could offer more effective control of symptoms.   In summary, the best answer is Option B, oral methylprednisolone and meloxicam, because it provides the most effective acute gout treatment.

This patient's presentation of bilateral hilar adenopathy, noncaseating granulomas, and a high CD4:CD8 ratio in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is suggestive of sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology that primarily affects the lungs. It is commonly seen in African American women and presents with noncaseating granulomas. The facial rash seen in this patient is likely lupus pernio, a specific skin manifestation of sarcoidosis that presents as reddish-purple lesions on the cheeks, nose, and ears.  However, the history provided points toward another diagnosis: chronic beryllium disease (CBD). CBD is an occupational lung disease caused by exposure to beryllium. This patient works in an airplane factory, an environment where beryllium is commonly used. CBD often presents with noncaseating granulomas and a high CD4:CD8 ratio in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which can make it difficult to distinguish from sarcoidosis.   Therefore, exposure to beryllium (option B) is the strongest predisposing factor in this particular case.   Although sarcoidosis is more common in African Americans (option A), the occupational exposure to beryllium is a more direct and compelling risk factor in this case. Smoking (option D) and alcohol consumption (option C) are risk factors for various lung and systemic diseases but are not directly linked to the formation of granulomas seen in this patient. Exposure to acid-fast bacilli (option E) leads to tuberculosis which does cause granuloma formation, but it is typically caseating, not noncaseating as seen here.

This patient's fever, new murmur, and multiple embolic phenomena (eg, conjunctival hemorrhage, tender nodules on her fingertips [Janeway lesions], and retinal hemorrhages with pale centers [Roth spots]) are suggestive of infective endocarditis (IE). The most common cause of IE is Staphylococcus aureus, followed by Streptococcus viridans and enterococci. However, in this patient, the history of colorectal cancer with a recent colonic surgery is concerning for Streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly S bovis) bacteremia and endocarditis, which is associated with colorectal carcinoma. Diagnosis is confirmed with blood cultures and echocardiography.  Option A: Pulmonary metastases from a primary colorectal cancer can cause symptoms of dyspnea and cough, but would not explain the systemic symptoms (eg, fever, weakness, chills), cardiac murmur, and embolic events seen in this patient.  Option C: Cardiobacterium hominis is a slow-growing, gram-negative organism and a member of the HACEK group. It is a rare cause of endocarditis and is not typically associated with colon cancer or recent surgery.  Option D: Aspergillus species are a rare cause of endocarditis and typically occur in severely immunocompromised patients (eg, prolonged neutropenia, solid organ transplantation). This patient's immune status is not significantly compromised.  Option E: Enterococcus faecalis is a common cause of endocarditis, particularly in patients with a history of genitourinary manipulation or instrumentation. However, it is not typically associated with colon cancer or recent colonic surgery.   Therefore, the correct answer is B: Streptococcus sanguinis infection.

This patient's preoccupation with his stool despite understanding and agreeing with the physician's reassurances is suggestive of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In OCD, individuals suffer from obsessions (persistent thoughts or impulses that are intrusive and unwanted) and compulsions (repetitive behaviors that an individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession). The obsessions or compulsions are time-consuming (e.g., take more than 1 hour per day) and cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Despite his understanding and agreement with the doctor's reassurances, this patient is compelled to continue thinking about his stool and seeking further medical evaluation, indicative of a compulsion. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (option B).  Option A, Tourette syndrome, is characterized by multiple motor tics and at least one vocal tic present for more than a year. These tics are not present in this patient's case.  Option C, Major depression, is characterized by sadness or loss of interest or pleasure in all or nearly all activities, which this patient does not show.  Option D, Paraphilia, involves intense sexual interest in atypical objects or situations, which is not indicated in this scenario.  Option E, Coprophilia, is a form of paraphilia where a person gets sexual pleasure from feces; however, this patient doesn't report any sexual pleasure from his thoughts, implying that this diagnosis is unlikely.

The correct answer is C: 'History of chemotherapy'.  Angiosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that forms in the lining of the blood vessels and lymph vessels. It is known that history of chemotherapy, particularly with anthracyclines, and radiation therapy are the most common risk factors for angiosarcoma. Anthracycline is a type of antibiotic that comes from certain types of Streptomyces bacteria. Anthracyclines work by blocking an enzyme called topoisomerase 2. This enzyme is needed by the cancer cells to divide and grow.  Option A: Inherited dysfunction of a DNA repair protein - While this can increase the risk of certain cancers (like BRCA gene mutations in breast and ovarian cancer), it is not specifically associated with angiosarcoma.  Option B: History of exposure to asbestos - Asbestos exposure is primarily associated with mesothelioma, a type of cancer that develops from the thin layer of tissue that covers many of the internal organs (known as the mesothelium), not angiosarcoma.  Option D: History of mastectomy with lymph node dissection - While this surgery is associated with a risk of lymphedema, it does not in itself increase the risk of angiosarcoma.  Option E: Hereditary disorder - There are some hereditary syndromes that can increase the risk of developing certain types of sarcoma, such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis, but most angiosarcomas are not associated with these conditions.

This patient's presentation of long limbs with an arm span exceeding his height, learning disability, and recurrent deep vein thrombosis suggests a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disorder caused by fibrillin-1 gene mutations. Cardiovascular involvement is common and includes aortic root dilation, aortic dissection, and mitral valve prolapse. Patients are also prone to ectopia lentis (upward lens subluxation), but the correct answer here is 'E': Ascending aortic aneurysm. This is because his presentation of crushing chest pain, ST-segment elevation, and markedly elevated troponin I level is suggestive of myocardial infarction. ST-segment elevation in V1 and V2 suggests occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery, likely due to thromboembolism from a dilated, dissected, or aneurysmal aorta. Marfan syndrome patients have a high risk of aortic dissection and aneurysm due to defective connective tissue.  Option 'A': Bilateral gynecomastia is often seen in Klinefelter syndrome, not Marfan syndrome. Option 'B': Downward lens subluxation is seen in homocystinuria, not Marfan syndrome (where upward lens subluxation is common). Option 'C': Macroorchidism is seen in Fragile X syndrome, not Marfan syndrome. Option 'D': Saccular cerebral aneurysms are seen in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, not Marfan syndrome.

This patient's history of alcohol use and recurrent pancreatitis along with the presence of a well-circumscribed, low-attenuation mass contiguous with the pancreas on CT scan are consistent with a pancreatic pseudocyst. Pancreatic pseudocysts are a common complication of chronic pancreatitis and can present with abdominal pain, early satiety, and weight loss due to compression of the stomach or duodenum. Most pseudocysts resolve spontaneously and can be managed conservatively with bowel rest and observation. However, symptomatic or enlarging pseudocysts (>6 cm or persistent >6 weeks) can be managed with CT-guided percutaneous drainage, endoscopic drainage, or surgical drainage (option E). Surgical intervention is reserved for cases in which there is suspicion of malignancy or complications, such as pseudocysts that are infected, rupture, hemorrhage, or cause biliary obstruction. In this case, the pseudocyst is large and likely causing this patient's symptoms, so drainage should be performed.  Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (option A) would be useful in patients with suspected biliary obstruction or choledocholithiasis, but there is no indication for this in the patient's presentation. Middle segment pancreatectomy (option C) and distal pancreatectomy (option D) are surgical procedures which would be more invasive than necessary in this situation. Percutaneous drainage (option B) is sometimes used, but it has a higher rate of complication (eg, infection, bleeding, pancreatic fistula) and lower success rate compared with endoscopic and surgical approaches.

The most likely cause of the patient's decompensation during resuscitation is E: Persistent intraabdominal bleeding. Given the patient's history of multiple stab wounds and his presentation with hypotension (low blood pressure) and tachycardia (fast heart rate), it's clear that he's in a state of shock, likely due to volume loss from bleeding. Despite receiving whole blood, his condition worsens, indicating ongoing hemorrhage.  A: Congenital long QT syndrome is a cardiac condition that can lead to dangerous arrhythmias, but there's no information in the question stem to suggest that this patient has this disease.   B: COPD or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a chronic lung condition typically seen in long-term smokers, but the patient's young age and relatively short smoking history make this less likely. Furthermore, COPD doesn't usually lead to acute decompensation and shock.  C: Heart failure can cause low blood pressure and tachycardia, but it wouldn't typically lead to an acute decompensation in response to a stab wound.  D: IgA deficiency is an immunological disorder that can increase susceptibility to infections, particularly of the mucosal surfaces. However, it wouldn't directly lead to hypotensive shock and sudden cardiac arrest in the setting of trauma.  Therefore, persistent intraabdominal bleeding is the most likely cause of this patient's decompensation and cardiac arrest. This is a life-threatening situation that requires immediate surgical intervention.

The most likely causal pathogen in this case is Escherichia coli (Option B). The patient's signs and symptoms (painful urination and urinary frequency) are suggestive of urinary tract infection (UTI), which is most commonly caused by Escherichia coli. The presence of leukocyte esterase on urine dipstick is also indicative of UTI, as this enzyme is released by lysed neutrophils and is a marker of inflammation caused by infection in the urinary tract.  Option A, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Option D, Chlamydia trachomatis, are sexually transmitted organisms that typically cause urethritis, cervicitis, or pelvic inflammatory disease, not UTI. These infections usually present with dysuria and vaginal discharge rather than urinary frequency.  Option C, Gardnerella vaginalis, is associated with bacterial vaginosis, a condition that presents with a thin, homogeneous, malodorous discharge rather than UTI symptoms. Also, it often presents without inflammation, and hence, the leukocyte esterase test would be negative.  Option E, Trichomonas vaginalis, is a sexually transmitted parasite that causes vaginitis, characterized by yellow-green frothy discharge and vulvar irritation, not UTI symptoms. Again, this infection usually presents with negative leukocyte esterase.  Therefore, based on the information provided, Escherichia coli is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms.

The correct answer is B: 'Cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, skeletal muscle'.   Muscle type X shows the highest cytosolic calcium concentration post-depolarization, which is characteristic of cardiac muscle. Cardiac muscle cells have extensive T-tubules and a large sarcoplasmic reticulum that houses a lot of calcium, which is released upon depolarization. The sarcoplasmic Ca2+ ATPase is responsible for actively pumping calcium back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thereby lowering the cytosolic calcium concentration. When antibodies against this enzyme are added, it inhibits the reuptake of calcium, leading to a higher cytosolic calcium concentration, which is observed in muscle type X.  Muscle types Y and Z both have lower, equal cytosolic calcium concentrations, which are however higher than their corresponding controls. This indicates that they have less sarcoplasmic Ca2+ ATPase activity than cardiac muscle, suggesting that they could be smooth and skeletal muscle. The distinguishing factor between these two types of muscle is then the presence of titin  a protein prominently found in skeletal muscle but absent in smooth muscle. Since muscle type Y shows a luminescent pattern when stained for titin, it suggests that it is skeletal muscle. This leaves muscle type Z to be smooth muscle.   The other options are incorrect because they do not correctly correlate the experimental observations with the distinguishing characteristics of the three types of muscle cells.

The correct answer is A: Prolactin.  The patient's symptoms of headaches and bitemporal hemianopsia, along with the finding of an anterior pituitary mass on MRI, are consistent with a pituitary adenoma. Pituitary adenomas can cause symptoms due to mass effect (such as headache and visual field defects) and/or hormone hypersecretion.  The pituitary gland is divided into the anterior and posterior pituitary, each of which secretes different hormones. The anterior pituitary secretes prolactin, growth hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH). Of these, prolactin, growth hormone, and ACTH are basophilic and would uptake a basophilic stain.   Given the patient's slight excess of a hormone that uptakes a basophilic stain, the possible hormones are prolactin, growth hormone, and ACTH. However, the most common type of hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma is a prolactinoma, which makes prolactin the most likely hormone detected in her blood.  Option B: Oxytocin and option D: Antidiuretic hormone, are secreted by the posterior pituitary and would not uptake a basophilic stain.   Option C: Growth hormone could also be possible, but patients with growth hormone-secreting adenomas usually present with acromegaly, which is not described in this patient.  Option E: Thyroid stimulating hormone is acidophilic and would not uptake a basophilic stain.

The boy's polyuria (as evidenced by bedwetting), polydipsia (increased water drinking), and unexplained weight loss, along with the presence of glucose and ketones in the urine, suggests new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1). Prolonged hyperglycemia leads to osmotic diuresis, dehydration, and eventually diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) if not treated. DKA is characterized by hyperglycemia (serum glucose >250 mg/dL), ketosis, and metabolic acidosis. The clinical features of DKA include polyuria, polydipsia, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, Kussmaul respirations (ie, rapid, deep breathing), and lethargy to coma. The diagnosis of DKA is confirmed by arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showing a low pH (acidemia) and low bicarbonate concentration due to the metabolic acidosis.   Option E, 'Serum glucose concentration > 600 mg/dL', is the correct answer.   Options A, B, D could be seen in different conditions but not in DKA.  Option A: Total body potassium is usually high in DKA as a result of the acidosis, not decreased.  Option B: Total body sodium can be low, normal, or slightly high during DKA, but not significantly increased.  Option D: Hypervolemia is not a feature of DKA which usually present with dehydration due to osmotic diuresis.  Option C, 'Increased arterial pCO2', is incorrect because the body would be compensating for the metabolic acidosis by hyperventilating (Kussmaul respirations) in an attempt to lower the CO2 level, not increase it. Hence the pCO2 would be expected to be low, not high.

The patient in this vignette is at risk of developing refeeding syndrome (option 'D'), a potentially fatal syndrome that occurs with the nutritional repletion of malnourished patients. Refeeding syndrome typically occurs within four days of starting nutritional rehabilitation. The hallmark of refeeding syndrome is hypophosphatemia, although hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia can also occur. This patient is at risk due to his critical illness and the stress of surgery, both of which increase metabolic demands.  Option 'A' - Cholelithiasis is more associated with rapid weight loss, such as seen in bariatric surgery patients.   Option 'B' - Hypocalcemia is not directly linked to parenteral nutrition or the mentioned surgery. It can occur due to multiple causes such as vitamin D deficiency, renal failure, or low serum albumin.   Option 'C' - Mesenteric ischemia is an acute condition usually associated with cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or shock. Although this patient had a gunshot wound and surgery, there is no mention of a significant blood loss leading to a low-flow state or an embolic event.  Option 'E' - Sepsis is certainly a possibility in any patient in the intensive care unit, especially one with a central line. However, refeeding syndrome is more directly related to the provision of total parenteral nutrition in a critically ill patient.

This patient's findings of breast redness, swelling, and peau d'orange skin changes (skin thickening that resembles an orange peel) are concerning for inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). IBC is a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer that spreads along dermal lymphatics and blocks them, leading to the characteristic skin changes. Given this, the correct answer is 'E': it shows predominant lymphatic spread.   As for the other options:  Option 'A': It is a benign lesion. This is incorrect because the clinical presentation is more suggestive of a malignant condition, specifically inflammatory breast cancer.  Option 'B': The inflammation is due to obstruction of dermal lymphatic vessels. This is partially correct as the inflammation is due to the obstruction of dermal lymphatics, but it's caused by the cancer cells, so this answer is insufficient.  Option 'C': The lesion expresses receptors for estrogen and progesterone. This option is incorrect because, while breast cancers can express these hormone receptors, IBC often does not, and receptor status cannot be determined from the clinical presentation.   Option 'D': The lesion is due to Streptococcal infection. This is incorrect because while a breast infection (mastitis) can present with similar symptoms, it is generally associated with breastfeeding and would be more localized rather than involving the entire breast. Additionally, it would typically respond to antibiotics and the symptoms would not persist for a month.  Always remember, in clinical scenarios, the answer is usually the option that best explains all the findings rather than just one.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is an Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) tear (Option A). ACL tears occur frequently in athletes and often result from a non-contact injury involving rapid deceleration and change in direction, as well as from a direct blow to the lateral aspect of the knee, as seen in this patient's history. The key features of an ACL tear include acute onset of swelling (due to a hemarthrosis) within a few hours of injury and a sensation of instability or "giving way".  Option B, a Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) tear, is less likely as these are usually due to a direct blow to the anterior tibia with the knee flexed (e.g., dashboard injury). They are less common than ACL tears and do not typically cause instability.  Option C, a Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL) tear would more likely present with medial-sided knee pain and swelling, and would likely be due to a direct lateral force to the knee, which is not described in this case.  Option D, a Medial Meniscal tear, typically present with joint line pain, swelling, or mechanical symptoms (eg, locking, popping), but the history of a traumatic injury with symptoms of instability makes an ACL tear more likely.  Option E, Iliotibial Band Syndrome, is a common overuse injury causing lateral knee pain. It does not cause acute swelling or instability, and it's not typically associated with an acute traumatic event.

The correct answer is E. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS).  The patient in this question has type 1 diabetes mellitus, which is a chronic disease that can potentially lead to poor fetal outcomes including neural tube defects, cardiac anomalies, and other birth defects. The recommended HbA1c level for pregnant women is less than 6.5%. Therefore, this patient's high HbA1c level of 8.3% indicates poor glycemic control and increases the risk of congenital anomalies. To examine the fetus for these potential anomalies, a diagnostic test such as CVS would be recommended. CVS is a prenatal test in which a sample of chorionic villi from the placenta is collected to test for specific genetic disorders.  Option A, an oral glucose tolerance test, is used to diagnose gestational diabetes in pregnant women, which is not applicable in this case as the patient has pre-gestational diabetes (type 1 diabetes mellitus).   Option B, a C-peptide assessment, is used to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, which is already known for this patient.  Option C, a triple test, is a maternal blood screening test that looks for three specific substances: AFP, hCG, and Estriol. It is used to assess the risk of certain birth defects, but it is not as definitive or as early as CVS.  Option D, serum creatinine, is a test used to assess kidney function. Although diabetes can lead to kidney disease, there are no signs of kidney disease in this patient. Moreover, it is less relevant to the current situation compared to CVS.

The correct option is B: III, IV.  The patients recent history of streptococcal pharyngitis (sandpaper rash and strawberry tongue) and current findings of facial swelling, irritability, hematuria, and low C3 are suggestive of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). PSGN is a type III hypersensitivity reaction to streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin. It is characterized by deposition of immune complexes in the glomeruli, which in turn triggers complement activation and inflammation. This is the same mechanism of injury seen in acute rheumatic fever (an autoimmune response to group A streptococcus infection) and in polyarteritis nodosa (an immune complex-mediated vasculitis), making option B (III, IV) the correct answer.  The Arthus reaction, listed in options A, C, and E, is a local type III hypersensitivity reaction characterized by immune complex deposition in the skin, but it is not triggered by the same mechanisms as PSGN, acute rheumatic fever, or polyarteritis nodosa.  Myasthenia gravis (option D) is a type II hypersensitivity reaction, characterized by antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor, leading to muscle weakness. Rheumatoid arthritis (option E) is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction involving T cells, not immune complex deposition, and is characterized by chronic inflammation of the joints. Neither of these conditions are triggered by the same mechanism as PSGN, acute rheumatic fever, or polyarteritis nodosa.

The correct answer is 'E: Methylated DNA'. DNA methylation is a biochemical process that adds a methyl group to the DNA molecule, often affecting its function. This process is most commonly associated with the regulation of gene transcription and is often found to be altered in cancer cells. Specifically, hypermethylation of DNA, which often leads to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes, is a common feature of many types of cancer.   By contrast, the other options listed are not as closely associated with an increased potential for malignancy:  A: Euchromatin is a lightly packed form of chromatin (DNA, RNA, and protein) that is rich in gene concentration and is often under active transcription. It is not specifically associated with cancer.  B: Nucleosomes are the basic units of DNA packaging, consisting of a segment of DNA wound around histone proteins. While changes in nucleosome positioning and structure can occur in cancer, they are not usually directly implicated in the development or progression of malignancy.  C: Heterochromatin is a tightly packed form of DNA, which is transcriptionally inactive. It is not directly associated with an increased potential for malignancy.  D: H1 protein is a type of histone protein that assists in the packaging of DNA into a compact, space-efficient structure. Like nucleosomes, changes in H1 protein can occur in cancer, but it is not directly implicated in the development or progression of malignancy.

The most appropriate next step in treatment for this patient's lesions is 'D': Topical estrogen.   This question is describing a postmenopausal woman with symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) due to decreased estrogen levels. VVA, also known as atrophic vaginitis, is a common condition in postmenopausal women and is characterized by symptoms like vaginal dryness, dyspareunia (painful intercourse), and itching. The physical examination can show pale and dry vulvovaginal tissues with loss of elasticity, and sometimes, petechiae or ecchymoses.   Local estrogen therapy (Option D) is the mainstay of treatment for VVA and is preferred over systemic therapy for women with only genitourinary symptoms of menopause. The estrogen in this therapy can come in several forms: cream, tablet, or ring.  The other options are incorrect:  Option A: Topical fluconazole is an antifungal medication used primarily for treating yeast infections of the vagina, which this patient's symptoms do not suggest.  Option B: Topical clobetasol is a corticosteroid used for inflammatory conditions, such as lichen sclerosus or eczema. The patient's well-demarcated white plaque is consistent with lichen sclerosus, but the biopsy did not show this condition.  Option C: Topical progesterone has no role in the treatment of VVA.   Option E: Phototherapy is not commonly used in the management of VVA and is more commonly indicated for conditions such as psoriasis, vitiligo, and other skin disorders.

The newborn's symptoms are most likely caused by 'C': Alcohol. The maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). FAS is characterized by growth retardation (evident with the low birth weight of 2.1 kg), specific craniofacial dysmorphic features (such as a short depressed nasal bridge and wide nose), and neurodevelopmental issues. Additionally, the infant's bilateral cataracts could be attributed to prenatal alcohol exposure.   Here's why the other options are incorrect:  A: Omeprazole - This is a proton pump inhibitor used for the treatment of GERD, but it is not associated with the symptoms described in this newborn.  B: Gentamicin - This is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that can cause ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, but not the symptoms seen in this newborn.  D: Atenolol - This is a beta blocker used for atrial fibrillation. It can cause intrauterine growth restriction, but not the other symptoms seen in this newborn.  E: Warfarin - This is an anticoagulant that can cross the placenta and cause a specific embryopathy (nasal hypoplasia, stippled epiphyses), but this usually occurs with first trimester exposure. Newborns exposed to warfarin during the second and third trimesters can present with central nervous system abnormalities (e.g., Dandy-Walker malformation, intellectual disability), but this newborn does not have any of these symptoms.

This patient's anxiety, insomnia, heat intolerance, weight loss, and neck mass are suggestive of hyperthyroidism, likely due to Graves' disease. Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder in which stimulating antibodies bind to the TSH (thyrotropin) receptor, resulting in increased thyroid hormone production, is the most common cause of endogenous hyperthyroidism. Other symptoms include hyperactivity, emotional lability, and hyperdefecation. Physical findings include warm, moist skin; a diffusely enlarged, nontender thyroid gland; stare due to eyelid retraction (lid lag); pretibial myxedema (nonpitting edema); and proximal muscle weakness. A fine, rapid tremor and hyperreflexia due to increased beta-adrenergic activity can also be present.   However, the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) (option B) in a relatively young person with hyperthyroidism should raise concern for toxic multinodular goiter (TMNG) or functioning thyroid adenoma, rather than Graves disease. Unlike Graves disease, these conditions are not autoimmune in nature but rather are caused by somatic activating mutations of the gene for the TSH receptor within the thyroid gland. The increased thyroid hormone production in these conditions is independent of TSH stimulation. TMNG and thyroid adenoma tend to occur in older individuals and can have a more subtle clinical presentation than Graves disease. AF and weight loss are more common in TMNG and adenoma than in Graves disease.   Although nonpitting edema, hyperreflexia, lid lag, and fine tremor can be seen in Graves' disease, they do not suggest a different underlying etiology.

The correct answer is 'A': Flecainide.  Flecainide is a class IC antiarrhythmic drug, which slows the conduction of sodium ions during phase 0 of the cardiac action potential, slowing the upstroke and prolonging the duration of the action potential, and subsequently the refractory period. This can help stabilize the heart rhythm and prevent arrhythmias.  Option 'B': Mexiletine is a class IB antiarrhythmic drug, which actually speeds up the phase 0 upstroke and shortens the duration of the action potential, opposite to the effects desired in the question.   Option 'C': Procainamide is a class IA antiarrhythmic drug, which does slow the phase 0 upstroke, but it also prolongs the refractory period by blocking potassium channels, which can potentially lead to a longer QT interval and potentially torsades de pointes.  Option 'D': Sotalol is a Class III antiarrhythmic drug that works by prolonging phase 3 of the action potential, not phase 0. This can lead to a longer QT interval and potentially torsades de pointes.  Option 'E': Timolol is a beta-blocker and does not directly act on the phases of the cardiac action potential. Instead, beta-blockers work by reducing the effects of the sympathetic nervous system on the heart, which can slow the heart rate and reduce blood pressure. However, they do not directly slow the phase 0 upstroke or increase the duration of the action potential.

The answer is E: Bronchial branch of thoracic aorta.  The esophagus is located in the mediastinum, posterior to the trachea and heart and anterior to the vertebral bodies. Given its close anatomical relationship, the bronchial arteries (branches of the thoracic aorta) are at significant risk of injury during esophageal surgery.   Option A, Esophageal branch of thoracic aorta, is incorrect as these vessels usually derive from the thoracic aorta and run along the esophagus, though they are smaller and less significant compared to the bronchial arteries.  Option B, Left inferior phrenic artery, is incorrect because this artery supplies the diaphragm and has a small esophageal branch but is located inferiorly and would not typically be at risk during surgery for an upper esophageal mass.  Option C, The inferior thyroid artery, is incorrect because this artery is located in the neck and supplies the thyroid gland. It is unlikely to be damaged during surgery on the upper part of the esophagus, which is located in the thoracic cavity.  Option D, Left gastric artery, is incorrect as it arises from the celiac trunk to supply the lesser curvature of the stomach and the lower part of the esophagus. This would not be at risk during surgery for an upper esophageal mass.   In conclusion, due to the close anatomical relationship between the esophagus and bronchial arteries, the bronchial arteries are at the highest risk for injury during esophageal surgery.

The patient's symptoms of easy fatigability and exercise intolerance along with physical examination findings of a wide fixed split second heart sound, systolic ejection murmur at the left middle and upper sternal border and a mid-diastolic rumble at lower left sternal border are characteristic of an atrial septal defect (ASD), particularly a secundum ASD (option E). In an ASD, oxygenated blood shunts from the left atrium to the right atrium due to a defect in the interatrial septum. Over time, this results in right-sided volume overload, leading to right atrial and right ventricular enlargement and increased flow across the pulmonic valve (manifesting as a systolic ejection murmur). The increased flow through the tricuspid valve can result in a mid-diastolic rumble. ASDs also cause a wide, fixed splitting of S2. This occurs because the extra blood in the right heart delays closure of the pulmonic valve.  The other options do not accurately represent the findings in ASD: Option A: Right ventricular end-diastolic dimension would actually be increased due to increased blood flow from left to right atrial shunting. Option B: Anterior movement of the ventricular septum during systole is characteristic of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, not ASD. Option C: A "gooseneck" deformity of the left ventricular outflow tract is typically seen in patients with congenital mitral stenosis, not ASD. Option D: Left ventricular shortening fraction would not be directly impacted by an ASD, which primarily affects right heart structures.

This patient's long history of smoking, chronic cough with sputum production, and shortness of breath with exertion are suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This diagnosis is further supported by the physical exam findings of cyanosis (indicating hypoxemia) and wheezing with a prolonged expiratory phase. On chest radiograph, findings in COPD would typically include hyperinflated lungs and loss of lung markings, corresponding to option 'C'.   Let's analyze why the other options are wrong: Option 'A' is suggestive of asbestosis which typically occurs in individuals with occupational exposure to asbestos, such as construction workers or ship yard workers.  Option 'B' is suggestive of congestive heart failure (CHF), which can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath and edema, but does not typically cause chronic cough with sputum production. Option 'D' is suggestive of lung cancer, which can definitely occur in a long-term smoker. However, his symptoms are more consistent with COPD rather than lung cancer. Option 'E' is suggestive of lymphangioleiomyomatosis or Langerhans cell histiocytosis which are rare diseases and not likely in this patient without any specific symptoms suggestive of these diseases.   Overall, based on this patient's history and physical exam findings, COPD is the most likely diagnosis.

The most likely cause of this patientâs findings is a parathyroid adenoma (E). The combination of hypercalcemia and elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) suggests primary hyperparathyroidism, the most common cause of which is a single parathyroid adenoma. The fact that the patient's mother had a parathyroidectomy suggests a possible genetic component. In addition, the patient is on lithium for bipolar disorder, which has been associated with hyperparathyroidism, possibly due to an effect on the calcium-sensing receptor that results in increased PTH secretion.   'A' is incorrect because excess calcium intake (eg, calcium supplements, antacids) can cause hypercalciuria but would not cause hypercalcemia unless renal function is compromised.   'B' is incorrect because abnormal calcium sensing receptors would lead to familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, but this option is less likely because the patient's mother had a parathyroidectomy, which is not usually required in familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.  'C' is incorrect because while excessive intake of Vitamin D can cause hypercalcemia, it does this by increasing absorption of calcium from the gut and reabsorption of calcium in the kidney. This would lead to hypercalciuria, not hypocalciuria as seen in this patient.  'D' is incorrect because while lithium can cause hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia, it is not due to toxicity. Rather, lithium can increase set point of calcium-sensing receptor in parathyroid cells, leading to increased PTH release. However, the PTH level in this patient is significantly elevated, more suggestive of a parathyroid adenoma than lithium effect.

The correct answer is E: 'Sensory loss to the dorsal surface of the foot and part of the anterior lower and lateral leg and foot drop'.   This patient has an anterior hip dislocation, which is associated with injury to the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve, composed of the tibial and common peroneal nerves, provides motor innervation to the hamstrings and all muscles below the knee. Sensory innervation includes the entire lower leg and foot except the medial aspect, which is supplied by the saphenous nerve (branch of the femoral nerve). Common peroneal nerve injury can lead to foot drop (loss of dorsiflexion), loss of sensation on the dorsal foot, and inability to evert the foot.  Option A is incorrect because it involves the common fibular (peroneal) nerve, which could be injured in a knee dislocation, not a hip dislocation.  Option B describes a femoral nerve injury, which could occur due to a pelvic fracture or iatrogenic injury during pelvic surgery, but not typically from a hip dislocation.  Option C describes an obturator nerve injury, which could occur due to pelvic surgery or a pelvic fracture, but not typically from a hip dislocation.  Option D describes damage to the ilioinguinal nerve, which could result from lower abdominal surgery or hernia repair, but not typically from a hip dislocation.

This patient's presentation of fever, night sweats, productive cough, and cavitation on chest radiography in the setting of advanced HIV is suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). However, his negative PPD and the presence of partially acid-fast, gram-positive branching rods on bronchoalveolar lavage indicate infection with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), not Mycobacterium tuberculosis. MAC is an opportunistic infection occurring in HIV patients when their CD4 count falls below 50 cell/mm^3. Pulmonary disease due to MAC can resemble TB with upper lobe cavitary disease. Treatment for disseminated MAC or MAC lung disease in HIV-infected patients consists of a macrolide (either azithromycin or clarithromycin) plus ethambutol. Therefore, the best answer is '50S ribosomal subunit inhibitor' (option C) as macrolides work by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit.  Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect as they do not represent the mechanism of action of the primary treatment for MAC. Cell wall synthesis inhibitors (option A) like Beta-lactams are not effective against mycobacteria due to their unique cell wall structure. 30S ribosomal subunit inhibitors (option B) like aminoglycosides are not first-line treatment for MAC. RNA synthesis inhibitors (option D) like rifampin are used in TB but not typically in MAC. Folate synthesis inhibitors (option E) like trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are used in other types of infections (e.g., Pneumocystis pneumonia) but not typically in MAC.

The presentation in this case is consistent with acute pericarditis, a condition characterized by inflammation of the pericardium. The most common cause in developed countries is viral illness, as in this patient who had an upper respiratory tract infection 2 weeks ago. Symptoms include sharp, pleuritic chest pain that is relieved by sitting up and leaning forward, and a pericardial friction rub on auscultation. Electrocardiogram typically shows diffuse ST-segment elevations and PR-segment depressions. In severe cases, pericarditis may lead to pericardial effusion and, rarely, cardiac tamponade.  The option 'D': 'Electrical alternans' is the most likely additional finding in this patient. Electrical alternans is a pathognomonic ECG finding in which there is a beat-to-beat alternation in one or more components of the ECG waveform (eg, P wave, QRS complex, T wave). It is most commonly seen in large pericardial effusions, especially cardiac tamponade, due to swinging motion of the heart in the pericardial fluid.  Option 'A': 'Sarcomere duplication' is seen in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, not in pericarditis.   Option 'B': 'Elevated brain natriuretic peptide' is usually seen in congestive heart failure, not typically in pericarditis unless there is associated heart failure.  Option 'C': 'Opening snap with low-pitched diastolic rumble' would suggest mitral stenosis, not pericarditis.  Option 'E': 'Right ventricular dilation' is more associated with conditions causing right heart strain such as pulmonary hypertension or left heart failure, not typically pericarditis.

Answer: B 'Colonoscopy at age 60'  Explanation: The patient's father had colon cancer at age 70. The American Cancer Society recommends that individuals with a family history of colorectal cancer in a first-degree relative (parent, sibling, child) diagnosed at age 60 or older, or two second-degree relatives with the disease should begin screening at age 40 or 10 years before the youngest case in the immediate family, whichever is earlier. However, if an immediate family member had colon cancer at age 70, then the patient should start her colonoscopy screenings at the age of 60.  Option A, Alcohol cessation, is not necessary as moderate drinking (up to 1 drink/day for women) is not associated with increased mortality.  Option C, Colonoscopy now, is not necessary because of the reasons stated above. Her risk is not high enough to warrant immediate screening.  Option D, Mammography at age 50, is not necessarily wrong but it is not the most appropriate initial step. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends biennial screening mammography for women aged 50 to 74 years. However, this patient has breast implants which can make mammogram interpretation more difficult, and she does not have a family history of breast cancer.  Option E, Mammography now, is not necessary because she is only 35 years old and there is no family history of breast cancer. Plus, as mentioned above, the presence of breast implants can make mammogram interpretation more difficult.

The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is Paramyxovirus, more specifically Measles virus, which is a type of Paramyxovirus.   Measles presents with a prodrome of fever, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis (the "Three Cs"), followed by development of Koplik spots on the buccal mucosa (small white spots on a red background). A maculopapular rash then develops, beginning at the head and descending down the trunk and extremities. The rash often becomes confluent as it spreads downwards. Measles is also associated with postauricular and other posterior cervical lymphadenopathy.   The other options are less likely given the patient's symptoms:  A) Togavirus: This family of viruses includes Rubella, which can cause a similar rash but it is usually less severe, and lacks the initial Three C's and Koplik spots.  B) Varicella zoster virus: This virus causes chickenpox, which presents as a vesicular rash (not maculopapular) that is more concentrated on the trunk than the extremities.   C) Parvovirus: This virus causes "slapped cheek" rash in children (erythema infectiosum, or fifth disease), which presents with mild systemic symptoms and a bright red rash on the cheeks, sparing the area around the mouth.  D) Human herpesvirus 6: This virus causes roseola, which presents with high fever followed by a rash once the fever subsides. The rash is typically pink, maculopapular, and well-circumscribed, usually starting on the trunk and spreading to the extremities and neck.

The correct answer is D. 'Lymphocytic infiltration with germinal follicle formation.'   This patient's symptoms of fever, anterior neck pain, and tender thyroid enlargement, in conjunction with a diffusely decreased uptake on thyroid scan, are classic for subacute thyroiditis (also known as de Quervain's thyroiditis). Subacute thyroiditis is believed to be a viral illness due to its frequent association with a preceding upper respiratory infection.  Histologically, subacute thyroiditis is characterized by granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells. However, one can also see prominent lymphocytic infiltration in the early stages of inflammation with germinal center (or follicle) formation.  Option A ('Follicular epithelial cell hyperplasia') is incorrect as it is more consistent with Grave's disease, which typically presents with hyperthyroidism, diffuse thyroid enlargement, and increased uptake on thyroid scan.  Option B ('Undifferentiated giant cells with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage') is incorrect as it is more consistent with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, which is a rare and very aggressive malignancy seen in the elderly.  Option C ('Concentric intracellular lamellar calcifications') describes psammoma bodies, which are seen in papillary thyroid carcinoma.   Option E ('Noncaseating granulomas with multinucleated giant cells') is incorrect as it describes the histological findings in sarcoidosis or tuberculosis, not thyroiditis. Noncaseating granulomas are never seen in subacute thyroiditis.

The most likely cause of this patient's presentation is 'A: The new dog'. The symptoms of high fever, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea are consistent with an infection caused by Campylobacter jejuni, a common bacterial cause of gastroenteritis. Puppies and dogs are known to carry this bacteria and could have transmitted it to the child. Also, the temporal relationship (symptoms starting approximately 3 weeks after getting a new dog) strengthens the likelihood.  'B: A recent antibiotic prescription' can cause diarrhea, but it would typically not present with high fever or bloody diarrhea. Antibiotics can lead to an infection with Clostridium difficile, which could cause bloody diarrhea in severe cases, but this would be unusual in a healthy 4-year-old.  'C: Reheated fried rice' is typically a cause for Bacillus cereus infection, which can cause vomiting and diarrhea but usually does not cause fever or bloody diarrhea.  'D: Exposure to bacteria at school' is possible, but the connection to the new dog and the specific symptoms make Campylobacter infection more likely.   'E: Failure to appropriately immunize the patient' could lead to various illnesses, but the presented symptoms and recent exposure to a new dog does not suggest a vaccine-preventable disease.

Option A, Tamsulosin, is the best choice in this case. This medication is an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, which functions by relaxing smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, thereby alleviating urinary symptoms including frequency, urgency and nocturia. Importantly, this drug is selective for the alpha-1A receptor subtype that is predominant in the prostate, which minimizes the risk of hypotension, a known side effect of nonselective alpha blockers.  Option B, Finasteride, is a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor that shrinks the prostate by blocking the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. It is also used in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), but it takes several months to take effect and is therefore not the best initial treatment choice.  Option C, Prazosin, is a non-selective alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist used for hypertension and BPH. However, due to the patient's history of symptomatic hypotension and syncope, this would not be the best choice as it may exacerbate these conditions.  Option D, Tadalafil, is a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor used for erectile dysfunction and can also be used to treat BPH. However, it has a slower onset of action compared to alpha blockers and is not typically the first choice for treatment.  Option E, Leuprolide, is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist used to treat prostate cancer and would not be appropriate as the patient's prostate enlargement is benign.

The most likely cause of this patient's sonographic findings is Entamoeba histolytica (Choice E). The patient's history of recent travel to Mexico, a developing country where Entamoeba histolytica infection is endemic, and the presence of liver abscess on imaging studies are highly suggestive of amebic liver abscess. Entamoeba histolytica causes amebiasis, which can present with symptoms ranging from asymptomatic cyst passage to invasive disease, including fulminant colitis and extraintestinal disease. The most common form of extraintestinal disease is amebic liver abscess. Patients typically present with right upper quadrant pain, fever, and hepatomegaly. Lab studies often show leukocytosis.  Option A, Penetrating duodenal ulcer: While the patient has risk factors for peptic ulcer disease (ie, tobacco use, daily NSAID use), the ultrasound findings are not consistent with a peptic ulcer.  Option B, Acute pancreatitis: This patient does not have the typical presentation of acute pancreatitis, such as severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, nausea, vomiting, and findings of acute inflammation (eg, fever, tachycardia).  Option C, Echinococcus granulosus: This is a parasite that causes hydatid disease and can form cysts in the liver. However, this is less likely than Entamoeba histolytica given the patient's history and symptoms. Echinococcosis is also more common in certain regions like the Mediterranean, the Middle East and South America.  Option D, Liver cancer: The patient does have risk factors for liver cancer (eg, tobacco use), but other symptoms such as weight loss, loss of appetite, and jaundice are typically present.

The most likely potential adverse effect of atorvastatin in this patient is myositis (option B). Atorvastatin is a statin medication, which is commonly used to lower cholesterol levels, particularly low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. One of the most significant potential side effects of statins is muscle-related symptoms, including muscle aches, soreness, tenderness, weakness, or, in severe cases, breakdown (rhabdomyolysis). If muscle symptoms occur, it is important to check creatine kinase levels to evaluate for myositis or rhabdomyolysis.  The other options are less likely for the following reasons:  A) Bloating is not typically associated with statin use. It is more often related to dietary factors or irritable bowel syndrome.  C) Elevated transaminases can occur with statin use, but this is less common and typically only occurs at high doses. Additionally, liver function tests are typically monitored in patients taking statins, and the medication would be adjusted if significant liver enzyme elevations occur.  D) Cholelithiasis (gallstones) is not associated with statin use. It is more related to factors such as obesity, female gender, increasing age, rapid weight loss, and certain diseases such as diabetes or hemolytic anemias.  E) Flushing is not typically associated with statin use. It is a common side effect of niacin, another lipid-lowering medication.

The correct answer is A. Aminolevulinate dehydratase.  This patient's symptoms of dark urine, abdominal pain, and peripheral neuropathy in conjunction with a history of phenytoin use suggest an attack of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). AIP is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a deficiency of porphobilinogen deaminase, which is involved in the heme synthesis pathway. This leads to an accumulation of upstream metabolites, particularly aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen. However, the neurologic manifestations seen in AIP (eg, neuropathy, neuropsychiatric symptoms) are believed to be caused by ALA.  During an acute attack, glucose and hemin (a heme analogue) are administered. Glucose administration helps by inducing insulin secretion, which decreases ALA synthase expression. Hemin works by inhibiting ALA synthase-1, the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the heme synthesis pathway in the liver. By suppressing the heme synthesis pathway, hemin reduces the accumulation of neurotoxic precursors (eg, ALA).  The other enzymes listed are also involved in the heme synthesis pathway, but are not specifically targeted for inhibition in the treatment of acute AIP: - ALA synthase (Option B) is the enzyme inhibited by hemin and glucose to prevent further accumulation of porphyrins and precursors. - Ferrochelatase (Option C) and uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (Option E) deficiencies are associated with different types of porphyria (eg, erythropoietic protoporphyria and porphyria cutanea tarda, respectively), not AIP. - Porphobilinogen deaminase (Option D) is deficient in AIP; however, the treatment is not aimed at inhibiting this enzyme.

The correct answer is C - Direct immunofluorescence analysis of perilesional skin biopsy.   This patient's presentation is suggestive of a condition called Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). SJS is a rare, serious disorder of the skin and mucous membranes, and is usually a reaction to a medication or an infection. The urinary tract infection and subsequent use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in this patient likely precipitated the development of SJS. The characteristic features include a prodrome of fever and malaise, followed by the development of painful mucosal erosions and cutaneous vesicles/bullae that eventually rupture and lead to skin detachment. The severity of SJS is determined by the extent of skin detachment: <10% body surface area (BSA) is SJS, 10-30% BSA is SJS/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) overlap, and >30% BSA is TEN. The diagnosis of SJS is made clinically with the aid of skin biopsy showing full-thickness epidermal necrosis and a sparse dermal infiltrate. Direct immunofluorescence is usually negative.  Option A - Gram stain and culture of skin sample would be more appropriate in a suspected skin infection, not in SJS. Option B - Biopsy and histopathologic analysis of skin lesions could be useful, but direct immunofluorescence is more specific for SJS. Option D - Urine collection (24-hour) would be more appropriate in a suspected metabolic or endocrine disorder, not in SJS. Option E - Flow cytometry would be more appropriate in a suspected hematological disorder, not in SJS.   Therefore, option C is the most appropriate choice to confirm the diagnosis of SJS in this patient.

The patient's long-term exposure to asbestos as a shipyard laborer and insulation technician, combined with his new lung nodules, suggests a diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is a rare and aggressive cancer that primarily arises from the pleura and, less commonly, the peritoneum. It is strongly associated with asbestos exposure and can arise decades after initial exposure. The tumor is locally aggressive and often presents with non-specific symptoms like dyspnea and fatigue. Radiographically, pleural mesothelioma may manifest as pleural thickening or nodules. Histologically, these tumors are composed of pleomorphic ("varying in size and shape") cells, including both spindle cells and multinucleated giant cells.  Option A - "Flat cells with keratin pearls and intercellular bridges" describes squamous cell carcinoma, which is associated with smoking but not asbestos exposure.  Option B - "Mucin-producing glands with squamous components" describes adenocarcinoma, which is not typically associated with asbestos exposure.  Option D - "Psammoma bodies" are characteristic of papillary carcinomas, including ovarian, thyroid, renal, and breast cancers, and serous carcinoma of the endometrium, but not mesothelioma.  Option E - "Small dark blue cells that stain for chromogranin" describes small cell lung cancer, which is also associated with smoking but not asbestos exposure.

This patient's history of type II diabetes, altered mental status, and laboratory findings of anion gap metabolic acidosis (HCO3-: 16 mEq/L), hyperglycemia (Glucose: 202 mg/dL), and renal insufficiency (Creatinine: 2.7 mg/dL) are suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is a medical emergency that typically presents with polyuria, polydipsia, abdominal pain, vomiting, and altered mental status. The most common precipitant is infection, but other causes include medication noncompliance, myocardial infarction, and stroke.   The mainstays of DKA treatment are intravenous fluids, insulin, electrolyte repletion (especially potassium), and treatment of the underlying precipitant.   Insulin therapy (Option A) is needed to suppress hepatic glucose production and lipolysis and to stimulate glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue. However, insulin therapy alone could lead to hypokalemia, as insulin shifts potassium into cells and thus lowers plasma potassium concentrations.   Potassium repletion (Option B) is necessary to correct the total body potassium deficit that is common in DKA. However, potassium repletion alone would not address the underlying metabolic derangement.  Bicarbonate (Option C) is generally not recommended for treatment of DKA.   Discontinuing the patient's home medications (Option E) would not address the acute metabolic derangement and could worsen his long-term glucose control.  Combining insulin and potassium (Option D) allows for correcting the metabolic derangement and preventing hypokalemia, thus it represents the best next step in management.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient with painless vaginal bleeding in the third trimester is placenta previa, which is when the placenta implants over or near the internal cervical os. Risk factors for placenta previa include prior cesarean section, multiparity, and advanced maternal age. The primary symptom of placenta previa is sudden, painless bleeding that usually occurs in the third trimester, as in this patient. Given the risk of provoking massive hemorrhage, digital cervical examination is contraindicated in any patient with suspected placenta previa until the diagnosis is excluded. Therefore, the best next step in management is transabdominal ultrasound (option D), which can safely establish the diagnosis.  Transvaginal ultrasound (option A) is used when transabdominal ultrasound is not diagnostic. However, caution should be taken to avoid inserting the ultrasound probe into the vagina too deeply, which could cause trauma and bleeding if placenta previa is present.  Digital cervical examination (option B) is contraindicated because it can lead to massive hemorrhage.  Coagulation studies (option C) can be useful in patients with suspected disseminated intravascular coagulation or coagulation disorders, but there is no indication for these conditions currently.  Amniocentesis and fetal lung maturity testing (option E) is not indicated because there is no current evidence of fetal distress or need for immediate delivery.

This patient's generalized fatigue, shortness of breath, lower extremity edema, and S3 gallop are suggestive of heart failure. Pregnancy is a state of increased circulatory volume and cardiac output that can unmask a previously asymptomatic cardiac condition. Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a dilated cardiomyopathy that presents with heart failure secondary to left ventricular systolic dysfunction towards the end of pregnancy or in the months following delivery, where no other cause of heart failure is found. It is a diagnosis of exclusion. The initial diagnostic test should be an echocardiogram (choice A) to evaluate left ventricular function.  Urinalysis (choice B) could be useful in diagnosis of preeclampsia, but this condition typically presents with hypertension and proteinuria which this patient does not have.  Lower extremity Doppler (choice C) would be indicated if deep vein thrombosis were suspected, which typically presents with unilateral leg pain and swelling, and erythema which this patient does not have.  Ventilation-perfusion scan (choice D) could be indicated if there were a high suspicion of pulmonary embolism, but this patient's lungs are clear to auscultation and there are no signs of deep vein thrombosis.  Reassurance and monitoring (choice E) would not be appropriate given this patient's symptoms and physical exam findings which are suggestive of a potentially serious condition like peripartum cardiomyopathy.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient's condition is D: Typhoid fever.   Typhoid fever is a systemic infection caused by Salmonella Typhi. It is characterized by fever, relative bradycardia, splenomegaly, and a rash of rose-colored spots on the torso and abdomen. The rash is seen in the second week of disease and is comprised of faint, salmon-colored macules that blanch on pressure. Severe cases can present with altered sensorium and shock, as seen in this patient, due to complications such as intestinal hemorrhage or perforation.  The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:  A: Addison disease is a condition where the adrenal glands do not produce enough steroid hormones. While this can lead to hyperkalemia, the patient's other symptoms such as the rash and fever are not typically seen in this condition.  B: Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a severe form of dengue fever, characterized by fever, thrombocytopenia, and increased vascular permeability leading to shock. The presence of a rose-spotted rash is not typical in this condition.  C: Diabetic ketoacidosis would present with acidosis and hyperkalemia, however, it would not typically present with a rash or a fever.  E: Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome is characterized by adrenal hemorrhage associated with septicemia, often following a bacterial infection. This condition may result in shock and widespread purpura, but not the characteristic rose spots seen in typhoid fever.

The most appropriate action in this situation would be Option C: 'Confront the colleague in private'. This is based on the principle of peer responsibility and the importance of addressing concerns directly with colleagues when there is a perceived impairment in their professional performance due to any reason including personal issues, substance abuse, etc. This might involve expressing concern about the observed behaviors and encouraging the colleague to seek help.  Option A: 'Advise resident physicians to report future misconduct to the department chair' is not wrong but it's an indirect approach and does not address the issue directly with the colleague.   Option B: 'Alert the State Licensing Board' is not the initial step unless there is an imminent risk to patient safety and the colleague has not responded to internal efforts to address the issue.  Option D: "Contact the colleague's friends and family" is not appropriate because it breaches professional boundaries and confidentiality.  Option E: 'Inform the local Physician Health Program'. This would be a step to take if the colleague does not respond to the direct confrontation or if there is an immediate threat to patient safety. The Physician Health Program is designed to provide help to physicians who are struggling with substance abuse, mental health issues, or other personal problems that affect their ability to safely practice medicine. However, it should not be the first step in this situation.

This patient's symptoms of intermittent epigastric pain and nausea, in association with her risk factors of hypertension, diabetes, and smoking, suggest the diagnosis of gastric outlet obstruction secondary to peptic ulcer disease. Given that the pain is intermittent and not persistent, perforation is less likely. However, the absence of vomiting does not rule out gastric outlet obstruction. This could cause her to have a ventricular gallop (option B) due to volume depletion from poor oral intake or vomiting, if present. A ventricular gallop, or third heart sound (S3), is associated with increased left ventricular filling pressure (eg, due to heart failure) and more rapid deceleration of early diastolic filling. An S3 is a low-frequency sound best heard at the apex in left lateral decubitus position.   Let's see why other options are incorrect: Option A: Decrescendo diastolic murmur - This is characteristic of aortic regurgitation, which this patient does not have any symptoms of. Option C: Atrial gallop - This is also known as a fourth heart sound (S4) and is seen in conditions with a stiff or hypertrophic left ventricle such as hypertension, aortic stenosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. While this patient has hypertension, the question does not provide information supporting increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Option D: Mid-systolic click - This is characteristic of mitral valve prolapse, which this patient does not have any symptoms of. Option E: Muffled heart sounds - This is seen in conditions like pericardial effusion or cardiac tamponade. Again, there is no evidence to suggest these conditions in this patient.

The correct answer is 'A': Tensor tympani.  This patient's history and presentation are consistent with a peripheral lesion of the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII), as evidenced by the ipsilateral facial paralysis (including the muscles of facial expression and eyelid closure) and hyperacusis (sound intolerance). The facial nerve provides motor innervation to the stapedius muscle in the middle ear, which contracts to dampen loud sounds. Injury to the facial nerve can result in stapedius muscle paralysis and subsequent hyperacusis. The facial nerve also provides sensory innervation to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and parasympathetic innervation to the lacrimal, submandibular, and sublingual glands. Although the tensor tympani (choice A) also dampens loud sounds, it is innervated by the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V), not the facial nerve.  The other options are incorrect based on the patient's symptoms:  - Stylopharyngeus (choice B): This muscle is involved in swallowing and is innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve. - Cricothyroid (choice C): This muscle is involved in vocal pitch control and is innervated by the superior laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve. - Anterior belly of the digastric (choice D): This muscle is involved in opening the mouth and is innervated by the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve. - Stylohyoid (choice E): This muscle elevates the hyoid bone and is innervated by the facial nerve. However, its paralysis would not be expected to cause the facial droop or hyperacusis seen in this patient.

The correct answer is D. Immediate laparotomy.  The most important determinant of survival in patients with abdominal gunshot wounds is the time from injury to surgery. Thus, early operative intervention is essential. Gunshot wounds to the abdomen are an indication for immediate laparotomy due to the high likelihood of intestinal, vascular, and solid organ injuries.   Option A, CT scan of the abdomen, is not the best choice because it would delay definitive treatment. Imaging studies are not necessary when the physical examination and mechanism of injury clearly indicate abdominal trauma.  Option B, Close observation, is not the best choice because the patient has a gunshot wound to the abdomen. This type of injury cannot be managed conservatively due to the high risk of organ and vascular damage.  Option C, Diagnostic laparoscopy, is not the best choice because it is not typically used in trauma settings. It is less sensitive and specific than open laparotomy and requires more time to perform, which is a critical factor in this scenario.  Option E, Diagnostic peritoneal lavage, is not the best choice because it has been largely replaced by focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) in the initial evaluation of trauma patients. Moreover, in this patient with an obvious indication for laparotomy, this diagnostic step would simply delay definitive treatment.

The correct answer is A: Left homonymous hemianopia.  This patient's head trauma resulted in a fracture of the sphenoid bone, which lies at the base of the skull and contains the sella turcica and the optic chiasm. The optic chiasm is located directly above the pituitary gland and is the site where part of the optic nerves cross. Damage to the optic chiasm can result in visual field defects, the most common of which is bitemporal hemianopsia. However, if the damage is lateral to the chiasm (eg, affecting one of the optic tracts), the patient will experience homonymous hemianopia, which is a form of horizontal visual field loss that affects the same (ie, homonymous) side of the visual field in both eyes.   The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:  B. Inward deviation of the left eye - This would suggest a problem with the lateral rectus muscle or the abducens nerve (CN VI), which are not associated with the sphenoid bone.  C. Left facial paralysis - This would suggest a problem with the facial nerve (CN VII), which is not associated with the sphenoid bone.  D. Decreased hearing in the left ear - This would suggest a problem with the cochlear nerve (CN VIII), which is not associated with the sphenoid bone.  E. Deviation of uvula to the right - This would suggest a problem with the vagus nerve (CN X), which is not associated with the sphenoid bone.

The correct answer is B: Colonoscopy only.  This patient's positive fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and history of a first-degree relative with colorectal cancer (CRC) are concerning for colorectal malignancy, of which anemia is a common paraneoplastic syndrome. The anemia in CRC is typically normocytic and normochromic, but in advanced disease, it can be microcytic and hypochromic due to chronic blood loss resulting in iron deficiency. Therefore, these findings warrant further investigation with colonoscopy, which is the most sensitive test for detecting colorectal polyps and cancer.  Option A: Endoscopy only would be incorrect because it would not provide visualization of the colon where the suspected malignancy is likely located.  Option C: Endoscopy and colonoscopy might seem like a good option, given the patient's iron deficiency anemia (which could signal an upper gastrointestinal source of blood loss). However, given the patient's personal history and positive FOBT, colonoscopy should be the first test. If negative, it may then be appropriate to perform endoscopy.  Option D: Iron supplementation may be necessary to correct the patient's iron deficiency anemia, but it does not address the underlying issue likely causing the anemia, which is the suspected colorectal malignancy.  Option E: Transfusion is generally reserved for patients with severe anemia causing symptoms such as chest pain, syncope, or heart failure. This patient's hemoglobin level, while low, is not low enough to warrant transfusion in the absence of such symptoms. Transfusion also does not address the likely underlying issue.

The patient's recent hospitalization, antibiotic use, and symptoms of profuse, foul-smelling watery diarrhea suggest antibiotic-associated diarrhea due to Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection. This infection typically occurs due to disruption of the normal intestinal flora by antibiotics, allowing for overgrowth of C. diff. Clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and penicillins are most commonly associated with C. diff infections. Diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of C. diff toxins A and B in stool.  The initial treatment for C. diff infection includes discontinuing the inciting antibiotic, if possible, and starting oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin. Metronidazole is less effective and is no longer recommended as initial therapy for C. diff infection, but can be used if other treatments are unavailable.   So, the most appropriate therapy would be either oral vancomycin (Option B) or oral fidaxomicin (Option C). However, in this scenario given the options, we would go with oral vancomycin (Option B) because it is the standard initial therapy for C. diff infection and is more cost-effective than fidaxomicin.  Oral rifaximin (Option D) is used in the management of hepatic encephalopathy and traveler's diarrhea but not C. diff infection. Intravenous metronidazole (Option E) is inferior to oral vancomycin for initial therapy of severe C. diff infection and is used only when oral therapies cannot be given.

The correct answer is E. Bone metastases.  This patient's history of breast cancer, new onset lower back pain, and an isolated elevation in her alkaline phosphatase (ALP) with a normal gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) are concerning for bone metastases. Bone is the third most common site of metastasis (following lung and liver) for many malignancies, including breast cancer. Back pain is a common symptom of vertebral metastases and may occur because of pathologic fracture, which seems to be the case in this patient, or spinal cord compression. ALP is often elevated in patients with bone metastases because it is produced by osteoblasts, which are stimulated when there is increased bone turnover, as can occur in malignancies of the bone. GGT, while also a marker of cholestasis, is more specific for biliary origin when elevated in conjunction with ALP, which is not the case in this patient.  Type 1 osteopetrosis (Choice A) is a genetic disorder that presents in childhood with pancytopenia, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and cranial nerve deficits due to bone overgrowth. Primary biliary cholangitis (Choice B) typically presents in middle-aged women with pruritus, jaundice, and hepatomegaly and is characterized by elevation in both ALP and GGT. Rheumatoid arthritis (Choice C) would manifest primarily as joint complaints, not lower back pain, and would not explain the elevated ALP. Paget disease of bone (Choice D), characterized by excessive bone remodeling, would present with bone pain, deformity, or fracture but would not be expected to present with an acute fracture, as in this patient.

The correct answer is B. Postural drainage of the chest.  This patient's sputum culture is characteristic of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an aerobic, non-lactose fermenting, oxidase-positive, gram-negative bacillus that is a common cause of chronic pulmonary infections in patients with cystic fibrosis. Pseudomonas species are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics, and treatment often requires combination antibiotic therapy, including an aminoglycoside (e.g. tobramycin) and an antipseudomonal beta-lactam (e.g. piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime).  However, despite the identification of Pseudomonas, the most effective treatment regimen for a cystic fibrosis patient with chronic cough and sputum production does not necessarily include immediate antibiotics. The mainstay of management in cystic fibrosis is chest physiotherapy to help clear the thick mucus from the airways. Techniques include postural drainage, percussion, and vibration, as well as the use of devices that create positive expiratory pressure. This approach reduces the risk of infection by preventing mucus from accumulating and serving as a growth medium for bacteria.  Options A, D, and E (Amoxicillin/clavulanate, Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and IV ciprofloxacin) are all antibiotics, and while chronic Pseudomonas infection in cystic fibrosis does often require antibiotic treatment, the first-line strategy is chest physiotherapy. Option C (Surgical therapy) would not be recommended in this patient without evidence of complications such as lung abscess, which are not present based on the information given.

The patient's symptoms of postprandial colicky right upper quadrant pain and the ultrasound findings of multiple round, hyperechoic structures within the gallbladder lumen are suggestive of cholelithiasis (gallstones). Gallstones are more common in individuals with the Four F's: "Fat, Forty, Female, and Fertile," which this woman certainly fits. The most common type of gallstone in the US is the cholesterol stone, which is associated with conditions of increased cholesterol secretion (eg, obesity, pregnancy, estrogen therapy), decreased bile acid secretion (eg, cirrhosis, ileal disease), and gallbladder stasis (eg, rapid weight loss, fasting).  Of the options provided, E) Morbid obesity is the most likely associated condition. Obesity increases the risk of gallstones by increasing cholesterol secretion into bile.   A) Diabetes mellitus is associated with a number of complications, but it is not specifically associated with gallstones.   B) Primary hyperparathyroidism can cause hypercalcemia, which can lead to calcium-based gallstones. However, these form a much smaller percentage of gallstones compared to cholesterol stones.  C) Chronic hemolytic anemia can cause pigment gallstones due to the increased turnover of red blood cells and subsequent increased bilirubin load for the liver to process. However, these usually appear as dark, radio-opaque stones on imaging.  D) Menopausal symptoms are not directly associated with gallstones. Although post-menopausal hormone replacement therapy has been associated with an increased risk of gallstones, menopause alone is not a risk factor.

This patient's symptoms of severe abdominal pain, changes in mental status, and peripheral neuropathy in the setting of heavy alcohol consumption are suggestive of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). AIP is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a deficiency in porphobilinogen deaminase, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of heme. During periods of fasting, illness, stress, or alcohol consumption, there is increased induction of aminolevulinic acid synthase, the first enzyme in the heme synthesis pathway. The resulting accumulation of porphyrin precursors can lead to the characteristic symptoms of AIP. The most common presentation is severe abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting that can be mistaken for an acute abdomen. Neurologic symptoms, such as peripheral motor neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and psychiatric symptoms, can also be present.   Initial treatment is glucose loading to decrease heme synthesis, making 'E' the correct answer.   'Hemin therapy' (option B) is also a treatment for AIP, but it is reserved for severe cases not responding to glucose.   'Chlordiazepoxide' (option A) is a long-acting benzodiazepine used in alcohol withdrawal, which is not suggested by this patient's presentation.   'Haloperidol therapy' (option C) is an antipsychotic medication, and while this patient does have psychiatric symptoms, treating the underlying cause of AIP will likely resolve these.   'Chloroquine' (option D) is used as treatment for malaria and certain autoimmune conditions, but does not have a role in the management of AIP.

The most likely cause of her vomiting is option D: Toxin ingestion from spore-forming organism. This is typical for food poisoning from Bacillus cereus or Clostridium perfringens, which are spore-forming bacteria often found in improperly stored or cooked foods, such as the picnic foods she consumed. Symptoms usually occur within a few hours after ingestion and include nausea, vomiting, and sometimes diarrhea. The illness is usually self-limiting and resolves within 24 hours.  Option A, viral infection, is less likely given the sudden onset of her symptoms immediately after eating the picnic food. Viral gastroenteritis usually has a longer incubation period.   Option B, hepatitis, is unlikely because it usually presents with jaundice, dark urine, and right upper quadrant pain, which the patient does not have.   Option C, gallstones, can cause vomiting, but are usually associated with right upper quadrant pain, which the patient does not have.  Option E, toxin ingestion from non-spore-forming organisms, could be a possibility. However, Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens (option D) are more commonly associated with food poisoning and the patient's rapid onset and resolution of symptoms. Non-spore-forming organisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus, also cause food poisoning but symptoms usually appear more rapidly (within 6 hours) compared to spore-forming organisms.

From the given description of the patient's presentation, the best fit diagnosis is likely Marfan syndrome. Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder characterized by tall stature, arachnodactyly (long fingers), and ectopia lentis (dislocation of the lenses of the eye). Cardiovascular manifestations, such as aortic root dilation and mitral valve prolapse, are common and can be life-threatening.  The midsystolic click followed by a late systolic, crescendo murmur described in the vignette is characteristic of mitral valve prolapse. This condition is typically best heard over the mitral area, which is essentially in the 'Area A' of the chest, also known as the apex of the heart.   The other options are less likely based on the typical locations of other heart sounds. 'Area C' corresponds to the aortic area where aortic valve sounds are best heard. 'Area E' corresponds to the tricuspid area where tricuspid valve sounds are best heard. 'Area F' corresponds to the pulmonary area where pulmonary valve sounds are best heard. 'Area G' represents an area on the chest where heart sounds are typically not auscultated. Thus, the correct answer is 'A: Area A'.  In this case, the other heart sounds are not relevant to the presenting condition, making 'Area A' the most appropriate choice.

The patient's polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, and mild intellectual disability suggest a diagnosis of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), which is characterized by renal resistance to vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone). This leads to an inability to concentrate urine, polyuria, and compensatory polydipsia. The most common form of hereditary NDI is X-linked and due to mutations in the V2 receptor, which is responsible for reabsorption of free water in the collecting tubules (answer choice E). Without appropriate V2 receptor stimulation, the renal collecting ducts remain impermeable to water regardless of the body's hydration status. The polyuria often causes secondary enuresis. Patients may also have nonspecific findings such as failure to thrive and intellectual disability.  Answer choice A (Defect of NaCl reabsorption at distal collecting tubules) describes Gitelman syndrome, which leads to a hypotonic urine and results in metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia.  Answer choice B (Defect of Na/K/2Cl cotransporter at thick ascending loop of Henle) is seen in Bartter syndrome, which also leads to a hypotonic urine and results in metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, and hypercalciuria.  Answer choice C (Generalized reabsorptive defect in proximal convoluted tubule) describes Fanconi syndrome, which leads to a hypotonic urine and results in metabolic acidosis, hypophosphatemia, aminoaciduria, and glycosuria.  Answer choice D (Hereditary deficiency of 11B-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) describes Apparent Mineralocorticoid Excess syndrome, which would result in hypertension and hypokalemia, not seen in this patient.

The patient's symptoms and history suggest a diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma, which is most likely caused by hyperplasia of spindle cells in the kidney (Option D). Renal cell carcinoma can present with nonspecific symptoms like fatigue, low back pain, and urinary frequency. This woman's history of smoking also puts her at increased risk for renal cell carcinoma. Furthermore, the presence of right costovertebral angle tenderness is suggestive of kidney pathology.  The other options are incorrect because they are not associated with the symptoms presented in this case.  Option A: Hyperplasia of chief cells in the parathyroid gland would result in hyperparathyroidism, which presents with symptoms of hypercalcemia such as constipation, depression, bone pain, and kidney stones, not the symptoms this patient is experiencing.  Option B: Chromaffin cells in the adrenal gland are associated with pheochromocytoma, which typically presents with episodic hypertension, headache, palpitations, and sweating.  Option C: Parafollicular cells in the thyroid gland produce calcitonin, a hormone that lowers blood calcium levels. Hyperplasia of these cells can cause medullary thyroid carcinoma, but this patient does not have symptoms suggestive of this condition.  Option E: Kulchitsky cells in the lung, when hyperplasic, can cause carcinoid syndrome, which presents with flushing, diarrhea, and wheezing due to the release of serotonin and other vasoactive substances. This is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

The correct answer is B: Ribulose-5-phosphate. This patient's symptoms of dermatitis, glossitis, neurologic abnormalities (eg, peripheral neuropathy), and fatigue are suggestive of vitamin B7 (biotin) deficiency. Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin and an essential cofactor for several carboxylation reactions, including the conversion of propionyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA, pyruvate to oxaloacetate, and acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. By consuming raw egg whites daily for the past year, his body has absorbed a protein called avidin, which is found in raw egg whites and binds biotin, preventing its absorption in the gut. Ribulose-5-phosphate is a precursor to nucleotide synthesis and needs biotin as a coenzyme in its synthetic pathway, thus this would be the substance most likely decreased in this patient as a result of biotin deficiency.  Option 'A' Cystathionine is an intermediate in the synthesis of cysteine from homocysteine, a process that requires vitamin B6, but biotin does not play a role in this pathway. 'C' Adenine is involved in nucleotide synthesis, but its synthesis is not directly dependent on biotin. 'D' Lactate is a product of anaerobic glycolysis and is not directly influenced by biotin levels. 'E' Oxaloacetate is a component of the citric acid cycle and while its conversion from pyruvate does involve biotin, it is not a substance that would be measured in the context of a deficiency. It is produced from other sources as well.

This patient's decreased visual acuity, photosensitivity, and brown corneal deposits can be explained by the long term use of Thioridazine, making option D the most likely answer. Thioridazine is a first-generation antipsychotic known to cause retinal pigmentation, which can lead to visual impairment. The retinal changes are dose-dependent and can occur with doses above 800 mg/day. Symptoms include difficulty seeing in the dark or low light and loss of visual acuity. Initial ocular findings are fine granular pigmentation in the area centralis of the retina. As the condition progresses, the pigmentation coalesces into a "salt and pepper" or "leopard-skin" pattern. In advanced cases, pigmentation is diffuse and involves the entire fundus, and visual acuity can drop to the 20/200 range.  Option A: Chlorpromazine, another first-generation antipsychotic, can cause corneal deposits, but these deposits are typically reversible and do not cause visual impairment. They also appear more whitish-grey rather than brown.  Option B: Clozapine, a second-generation antipsychotic, is not associated with significant ocular side effects.  Option C: Haloperidol, a first-generation antipsychotic, is associated with oculogyric crisis (a dystonic reaction), but not with visual impairments or corneal deposits.  Option E: Ziprasidone, a second-generation antipsychotic, is not associated with significant ocular side effects.

This patient's severe, constant, localized back pain, history of breast cancer, and elevated alkaline phosphatase level (suggestive of bone involvement) are concerning for metastatic disease. Breast cancer commonly metastasizes to bone, liver, and lung. Bone metastases may be osteolytic (from secretion of parathyroid hormone-related peptide), osteoblastic (from secretion of bone morphogenetic proteins), or mixed.  The initial imaging modality of choice to evaluate suspected bone metastasis is plain radiography ('C': 'X-ray of the spine'). If the x-ray is negative but suspicion remains high, additional imaging with MRI is recommended because of its high sensitivity. If multiple sites of disease are suspected, radionuclide bone scanning (technetium-99m scintigraphy) can be performed because of its ability to assess the whole skeleton. However, it has lower sensitivity and specificity compared with MRI. PET scan is even more sensitive but is usually reserved for cases in which other imaging modalities are inconclusive. Biopsy is typically reserved for cases in which the diagnosis is in doubt.  So, the correct answer is 'C': 'X-ray of the spine'. Other options are not wrong but based on the given scenario and guidelines, X-ray of the spine is the initial step. Other options may be considered later based on the outcomes of the X-ray.

The correct answer is C. Gastrointestinal endoscopy.  This patient's lack of response to appropriate iron supplementation suggests a more sinister underlying cause, such as gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, that is not being addressed. Her history of chronic dyspepsia and minimal improvement in iron studies and hemoglobin level despite iron supplementation suggest a possible upper GI source (eg, gastric or duodenal ulcer). In a patient over 40 years of age with iron deficiency anemia, especially accompanied by GI symptoms, it is vital to rule out a GI malignancy as the cause of bleeding and anemia. Upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy is often the most appropriate next step in these patients to visualize the GI tract and to find and biopsy any potential malignancies.  Option A (Hemoglobin electrophoresis) would be useful if a hemoglobinopathy (eg, thalassemia, sickle cell disease) were suspected, but this patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are more consistent with iron deficiency anemia.  Option B (Fecal occult blood tests) can detect blood not visible in the stool, but it does not localize the source of bleeding.  Option D (Bone marrow biopsy) might be considered if there were suspicion of a primary bone marrow disorder, which is not suggested in this case.  Option E (Helicobacter pylori fecal antigen) could be considered given the patient's chronic dyspepsia, but the anemia should take precedence as it is the more severe symptom. If an upper endoscopy is performed and an ulcer is found, it would be appropriate to test for H. pylori at that time.

This patient's presentation of hypertension, headache, abdominal pain, and seizure at 36 weeks' gestation is concerning for eclampsia, which is the occurrence of seizures in a patient with preeclampsia (ie, new-onset hypertension and either new-onset proteinuria or end-organ dysfunction after 20 weeks' gestation). Management involves stabilizing the mother and delivering the fetus as soon as it is feasible. Initial management should focus on ensuring a secure airway and preventing maternal injury during the seizure. After the seizure, intravenous magnesium sulfate should be initiated immediately to prevent recurrent seizures. Antihypertensive therapy should also be initiated for systolic blood pressure >160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure >105 mm Hg to prevent maternal stroke. Intravenous labetalol and hydralazine are first-line agents, and oral nifedipine is an alternative for patients who cannot receive these medications. Therefore, the correct answer is D.  Option A is incorrect because diazepam is not indicated in the management of eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate is the drug of choice to prevent recurrent seizures. Option B is incorrect because although magnesium and monitoring are important, they are not sufficient. This patient also requires antihypertensive therapy to prevent maternal stroke. Option C is incorrect as Cesarean section should not be done immediately as maternal stabilization is required before delivery. It also does not mention the use of antihypertensive medication. Option E is also incorrect as it does not include magnesium sulfate for seizure prevention, and also unnecessarily suggests cesarean section without stabilization of the patient.

The correct answer is 'B': 'A+, B+, AB+, O+'.   This is because the patient's blood type is AB+, which means that they have A, B, and Rh antigens on the surface of their red blood cells (RBCs). Therefore, they can receive blood from any blood type as their body will not produce antibodies against these antigens.   Option 'A' is incorrect because it only includes negative Rh blood types. This patient is Rh positive and can receive both Rh positive and Rh negative blood.   Option 'C' is incorrect because it doesn't include AB+ and O+, both of which the patient can receive.  Option 'D' is also incorrect because it excludes A+ and B+, which the patient can receive.  Option 'E' is incorrect because, although it includes all blood types, it unnecessarily includes negative Rh blood types. While not harmful, there is no need to restrict to negative Rh blood types for a patient with Rh positive blood. The supply of Rh negative blood is often limited and is usually reserved for patients with Rh negative blood.   Therefore, the correct answer is 'B' as it includes all blood types that the patient can receive (A+, B+, AB+, O+) and does not unnecessarily restrict to Rh negative blood types.

The answer is A: Insufficient CFTR channel production.  Cystic Fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) gene. The most common mutation, called the F508del mutation, leads to the production of a CFTR protein that does not fold properly. This misfolded protein is detected by the cells quality control system and is degraded, leading to insufficient amounts of CFTR at the cell surface.  The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:  Option B: Defective post-translational glycosylation of the CFTR channel. Glycosylation does take place during the processing of the CFTR protein, but it is not the main defect in cystic fibrosis. The primary problem is a folding defect that leads to degradation of the protein before it reaches the cell surface.  Option C: Excess CFTR channel production. This is incorrect; the problem in cystic fibrosis is insufficient CFTR at the cell surface, not excess.  Option D: Defective post-translational hydroxylation of the CFTR channel. Hydroxylation is not a major post-translational modification of the CFTR protein.  Option E: Defective post-translational phosphorylation of the CFTR channel. Phosphorylation does play a role in the function of the CFTR protein, but the primary defect in the most common form of cystic fibrosis is a failure of the protein to reach the cell surface in adequate amounts due to a folding defect and subsequent degradation.

The patient's clinical presentation and occupational history are highly suggestive of asbestosis, which is characterized by inspiratory crackles, lower lobe fibrosis, and calcified pleural plaques. Asbestosis is a result of long-term exposure to asbestos, which is often found in construction and demolition industries. Of the options provided, the most likely condition this patient is at risk of developing is Mesothelioma (Choice D), a malignant tumor of the mesothelium often associated with asbestos exposure.   The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:  Thyroid carcinoma (Choice A) is not typically associated with asbestos exposure or the symptoms the patient is exhibiting.  Tuberculosis (Choice B) could present with similar respiratory symptoms, but the patient's occupational history and absence of systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss) make it less likely. Also, TB would not typically cause bilateral calcified pleural plaques.  Sarcoidosis (Choice C) is a systemic granulomatous disease that typically presents with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on imaging, noncaseating granulomas on biopsy, and may have systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue. It would not typically cause the lower lobe fibrosis or calcified pleural plaques seen in this patient.  Bronchogenic carcinoma (Choice E) is indeed associated with smoking and asbestos exposure, but it would not typically cause the lower lobe fibrosis or calcified pleural plaques seen in this patient. It is important to note that the patient is at increased risk for bronchogenic carcinoma due to his smoking history and asbestos exposure, but this question is asking for the disease most directly linked to the patient's current symptoms and findings.

Based on the information provided, the patient's symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, and diarrhea along with the noted findings on physical examination are indicative of inflammatory bowel disease, specifically Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition that can affect any part of the GI tract from the mouth to the anus. Abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and anemia are common symptoms.  The presence of Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) is commonly associated with Crohn's disease, thus the correct answer is B.  The other options are associated with different conditions:  Option A: A positive lactose hydrogen breath test is used to diagnose lactose intolerance. There is no indication that this patient has lactose intolerance.  Option C: Perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA) are commonly associated with ulcerative colitis, another form of inflammatory bowel disease. However, the patient's symptoms and colonoscopy findings are more consistent with Crohn's disease.  Option D: PAS-positive cytoplasmic granules are seen in Whipple's disease, a rare bacterial infection that affects the small intestine. Symptoms may include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss, but the colonoscopy image likely does not show this.  Option E: Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies are associated with celiac disease, a condition that causes damage to the lining of the small intestine when gluten is eaten. While diarrhea and weight loss may occur, the patient's symptoms and the findings on colonoscopy are more indicative of Crohn's disease.

The correct answer is D. This patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are consistent with sickle cell anemia. This is a genetic disorder that predominantly affects African-Americans, with clinical presentations such as fatigue, jaundice, and bone and abdominal pain. Sickle cell patients are at an increased risk of infection, especially from encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Neisseria meningitidis, due to functional asplenia that occurs as a result of repeated splenic infarctions. Pneumococcal infection is a common cause of death in patients with sickle cell disease. Therefore, these patients should receive pneumococcal vaccinations. They should receive the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in infancy and the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) beginning at age 2.  'A' is incorrect because these vaccines are actually recommended for patients with sickle cell disease, not contraindicated. 'B' is incorrect because the serogroup B meningococcal vaccine is generally recommended for individuals at increased risk of meningococcal disease, such as those with anatomical or functional asplenia, but the recommended age is between 16 and 23 years old, not 10. 'C' is incorrect because there is no serogroup D meningococcal vaccine, and sickle cell patients do not have an increased risk of serogroup B infection. 'E' is incorrect because sickle cell patients are at an increased risk of infection due to functional asplenia, so additional vaccinations are definitely advised.

Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means it is carried on a non-sex chromosome and both parents must contribute a copy of the defective gene for a child to be affected. If both parents are carriers (heterozygous) for the disease, each child has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being a carrier like the parents, and a 25% chance of not carrying the mutation at all.  In this case, the patient's two siblings died from Tay-Sachs disease, implying that both of her parents were carriers. Since the patient is unaffected, she could either be a carrier (inherited one defective gene) or not carry the mutation at all (inherited no defective genes). Therefore, the possible genotypes for this woman are either heterozygous carrier or homozygous non-carrier.  Since there are two possibilities, and one of them is being a carrier, the probability is 50% that she is a heterozygous carrier of the mutation that causes Tay-Sachs disease. So, the correct option is 'E: 50%'.  The other options are incorrect because they either underestimate or overestimate her risk. For example, 'A: 0%' would be the risk if both parents were unaffected and non-carriers, and 'D: 66%' would be the risk if one parent was affected and the other was a carrier. 'B: 25%' and 'C: 33%' do not accurately represent the risk of being a carrier when both parents are carriers.

The clinical presentation in this question is consistent with a hydrocele, likely due to a patent processus vaginalis allowing fluid entry into the scrotum (B). A hydrocele is a fluid-filled sac surrounding a testicle that results in the swelling of the scrotum. The processus vaginalis is an outpouching of the peritoneum that normally closes after the testis descends into the scrotum. If it remains patent, it can allow peritoneal fluid to enter the scrotum, leading to a hydrocele.  Option A: Compression of the left renal vein at the aortic origin of the superior mesenteric artery is a description of nutcracker syndrome, which usually presents with left flank pain and hematuria due to increased venous pressure and ruptured small vessels.  Option C: Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection leads to epididymitis, which is characterized by acute onset of severe pain, redness, and swelling, and is usually unilateral. It often presents with symptoms of a urinary tract infection and is less likely to cause a palpable, painless mass.  Option D: Unilateral failure of the testis to descend into the scrotum is known as cryptorchidism. This would result in an absence of one testis in the scrotum rather than the presence of an additional mass.   Option E: Testicular torsion, due to the twisting of the spermatic cord, presents with sudden severe testicular pain, nausea, and vomiting. It is a surgical emergency and does not usually present as a painless, palpable mass.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is B: Depression. The patient exhibits several key symptoms of depression: feelings of sadness and hopelessness, loss of interest in activities (school), feelings of worthlessness, guilt, recurrent thoughts of death or suicide (Grandfather's death), and insomnia. It is important to note that depression can occur without the presence of a clear precipitating factor and is often multifactorial. This patient's depression may be tied to his academic stress, relationship concerns, and unresolved guilt over his grandfather's death.  'A': Acute stress disorder is incorrect because this disorder occurs within 3 days to 1 month after exposure to a traumatic event and can cause dissociative symptoms, re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal, none of which are mentioned in this patient's case.  'C': Generalized anxiety disorder is incorrect because this condition is characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry about everyday things, generalized and not specific to any one concern. The patient's worries seem to be about specific concerns related to school, relationships, and his grandfather's death.  'D': Obsessive-compulsive disorder revolves around compulsions, actions taken to minimize the obsessive thoughts. The patient does not exhibit any specific compulsive behaviors aimed at alleviating his distress.  'E': Post-traumatic stress disorder is inappropriate as this disorder is characterized by re-experiencing of a traumatic event (not a relative's natural death), avoidance of stimuli associated with the event, negative alterations in thoughts/mood, and increased arousal/reactivity. This patient's symptoms do not fully meet these criteria.

The patient's hospital-acquired diarrhea following antibiotic use, accompanied by leukocytosis and a fever, suggests a diagnosis of Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile infection (CDI). CDIs are often caused by clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins, including ceftriaxone. This occurs because these antibiotics disrupt the normal gut flora, allowing C. difficile to proliferate. The bacteria then release toxins that cause inflammation and damage to the colon resulting in symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever.  The most sensitive test for diagnosing a CDI is the nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) (Option D), which is a PCR test for the toxin B gene. This test has mostly replaced other diagnostic methods due to its high sensitivity (>90%).  Option A (Endoscopy) is not typically used for diagnosis of CDI as it is invasive and potentially risky for elderly patients or those with comorbidities.   Option B (Enzyme immunoassay glutamate dehydrogenase) is a test for a common antigen produced by both toxigenic and nontoxigenic C. difficile. However, it has a high false-positive rate and is less sensitive than the NAAT.  Option C (Gram stain of stool sample) can be used to identify C. difficile, but the sensitivity is relatively low because the organism may be present in small numbers and can be missed.  Option E (Stool culture for bacterial isolation and toxin presence) is the most specific test for detecting C. difficile, but it is less sensitive and more time-consuming than the NAAT, and therefore not the first-line test.

The correct answer is B: 'Bacterial peptidyl transferase activity at the 50S subunit'.  The clinical features and laboratory findings of this patient suggest a diagnosis of Ehrlichiosis, which is a tick-borne disease commonly found in the southeastern and south-central United States. Ehrlichiosis is caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis, an intracellular, gram-negative bacterium that primarily infects mononuclear phagocytes. Clinical features include fever, headache, myalgia, and malaise. Laboratory findings may demonstrate leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver transaminases. The pathognomonic finding is morulae (clusters of organisms) in monocytes on peripheral blood smear.  The treatment of choice for Ehrlichiosis is Doxycycline, a bacteriostatic antibiotic that reversibly binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit and prevents the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the acceptor site on the mRNA-ribosome complex, thus inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis.  Explanation for other options:  A: Transcription of bacterial DNA by RNA-polymerase is inhibited by the antibiotic Rifampin, not Doxycycline.  C: Bacterial topoisomerase II and topoisomerase IV activity are inhibited by Fluoroquinolones, not Doxycycline.  D: Peptidoglycan crosslinking and bacterial cell wall synthesis are inhibited by beta-lactam antibiotics (e.g., penicillins, cephalosporins), not Doxycycline.  E: While Doxycycline does interfere with bacterial protein synthesis, it does not do so by directly inhibiting the binding of bacterial tRNA to the acceptor site of ribosomes. Instead, it prevents the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the acceptor site on the mRNA-ribosome complex.

The correct answer is A. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) system.  Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic medication used in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute asthma exacerbations. It works by blocking muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the smooth muscles of the bronchi in the lungs, preventing bronchoconstriction and increasing airway caliber. It leads to the inhibition of the parasympathetic system, which results in an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This increase in cAMP leads to bronchodilation.  Option B, the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) system, is not directly affected by ipratropium bromide. It is more related to medications such as nitrates and sildenafil, which enhance the effect of nitric oxide leading to an increase in cGMP and vasodilation.  Option C, the arachidonic acid system, is more related to the production of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes. It is not directly affected by ipratropium bromide.  Option D, the phosphoinositol system, is not directly affected by ipratropium bromide. It is involved in the action of hormones and growth factors, leading to the production of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which trigger the release of calcium and protein kinase C activation, respectively.  Option E, the tyrosine kinase system, is associated with the action of growth factors and cytokines. It is not directly affected by ipratropium bromide.

The answer is A. The PCV13 vaccine is contraindicated in patients over the age of 65 years.  The PCV13 (Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) is not routinely recommended for adults over the age of 65 years unless they have specific risk factors for pneumococcal disease (e.g. immunocompromised states such as HIV, chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin disease, generalized malignancy, multiple myeloma, solid organ transplant, congenital immunodeficiency). Healthy patients over the age of 65 should receive PPSV23 (Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine).  Option B is incorrect because intussusception is not a contraindication to receiving the PCV13 vaccine. Intussusception is a potential side effect of the rotavirus vaccine, not the pneumococcal vaccine.  Option C is incorrect because an allergic reaction to the Tdap (Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) vaccine does not contraindicate the use of the PCV13 vaccine. These are two different vaccines, and an allergy to one does not indicate an allergy to the other.  Option D is incorrect because taking aspirin does not contraindicate the use of the PCV13 vaccine. There is no known interaction between aspirin and the pneumococcal vaccines.  Option E is incorrect because hyperlipidemia does not contraindicate the use of the PCV13 vaccine. There is no known interaction between hyperlipidemia and the pneumococcal vaccines.

The correct answer is B. Linear dsRNA virus.   This patient's presentation of acute diarrhea after travel is consistent with gastroenteritis. The most common cause of acute viral gastroenteritis in adults is norovirus, which has a linear dsRNA genome. Norovirus is known for its predilection for causing outbreaks of gastroenteritis in closed settings (eg, cruise ships), but it can also be acquired through sporadic community transmission. The infection is typically self-limited, with symptoms usually resolving within 2 to 3 days. Diagnosis is usually clinical, and treatment is supportive.  Option A, Linear dsDNA virus, is incorrect because most dsDNA viruses (eg, herpesviruses, poxviruses, papillomaviruses) cause diseases that affect the skin or mucous membranes, and not gastroenteritis.  Option C, ssDNA virus, is a characteristic of Parvovirus B19 which causes erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) in children and aplastic crises in patients with sickle cell disease, but does not cause gastroenteritis.  Option D, (+) ssRNA virus, includes many different families of viruses. Some, like coronavirus and rhinovirus, can cause upper respiratory tract infections, but are not typically associated with gastroenteritis.  Option E, (-) ssRNA virus, includes many different families of viruses. Some, like influenza and parainfluenza, can cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections, but are not typically associated with gastroenteritis.

The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is cryptococcal meningitis, which is a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS, especially when the CD4+ count falls below 100/mm3. Cryptococcus is a fungus that can be seen in cerebrospinal fluid using an India ink stain.   The answer is 'D': Focal neurologic deficits. In addition to headache and altered mental status, patients with cryptococcal meningitis may present with focal neurologic deficits due to increased intracranial pressure or cryptococcoma formation.   Now let's discuss why the other options are wrong:  'A': Ataxia - This is not a characteristic symptom of cryptococcal meningitis.  'B': Chancre - This is a symptom of primary syphilis and is not associated with cryptococcal meningitis.  'C': Cranial neuropathy - This is not a characteristic symptom of cryptococcal meningitis. It can be seen in several other conditions including diabetes, certain infections, and tumors.  'E': Pulmonary symptoms - This is not a typical presentation for cryptococcal meningitis. Although Cryptococcus can cause pneumonia, it is generally asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on chest imaging. When symptoms do occur, they are non-specific and can include cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Moreover, pulmonary symptoms are not specific and can be seen in many other conditions.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is (C) Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The disorder is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder characterized by increased proliferation of myeloid cells in the bone marrow. It is caused by a translocation between chromosome 9 and 22, creating a fusion gene known as BCR-ABL which encodes a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that drives the proliferation of the myeloid cells. The most frequent symptoms at presentation are fatigue, weight loss, and splenomegaly. Symptoms due to increased metabolic demand (eg, night sweats) and extramedullary hematopoiesis (eg, splenomegaly) are also common. Laboratory findings often include leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and anemia.   The other options are incorrect because:  (A) Myelofibrosis is characterized by fibrosis of the bone marrow leading to pancytopenia and extramedullary hematopoiesis, but it does not present with thrombocytosis.  (B) Essential thrombocythemia is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by sustained megakaryocyte proliferation and increased number of circulating platelets, but it does not present with splenomegaly and it is not associated with a mutation in chromosome 9.  (D) Polycythemia vera is characterized by an increased number of red blood cells. This patient's blood count does not indicate an increase in red blood cells.  (E) Aplastic anemia is characterized by pancytopenia and hypoplastic bone marrow. This patient's blood count does not indicate pancytopenia and his bone marrow is not hypoplastic.

The answer is E: 'Poor delivery of the medicines to the target tissue'.  This patient has developed hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), which is often due to gram-negative bacilli (eg, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) or Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA). Risk factors for HAP include mechanical ventilation, which bypasses the upper airway's defense mechanisms, allowing bacteria direct access to the sterile lower respiratory tract. Antibiotic treatment is often ineffective, despite in vitro susceptibility of the pathogen, due to inadequate antibiotic penetration into the lung parenchyma and respiratory secretions, making poor delivery of the medicines to the target tissue (Choice E) the most likely cause of treatment failure.  The other choices do not typically account for antibiotic treatment failure in cases of pneumonia. For instance, abnormally rapid clearance of the medicines by the kidney (Choice A) is unlikely without evidence of renal dysfunction. Similarly, abnormally rapid metabolism of the medicines by the liver (Choice B) is a less likely cause of treatment failure as neither cefepime nor daptomycin is metabolized by the liver. Inactivation of the medicine in the target tissue (Choice C) is not a common reason for treatment failure in HAP. Lastly, low bioavailability of the medicines (Choice D) is not a concern as both antibiotics are given intravenously, which ensures 100% bioavailability.

The correct answer is C. Hyperinsulinism.  This newborn's hypoglycemia (glucose <40 mg/dL), jitteriness, poor feeding, and high hematocrit are most likely due to maternal smoking, which leads to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and chronic fetal hypoxia. Chronic fetal hypoxia results in increased erythropoiesis and subsequent polycythemia (Hct >65%), which can be seen with facial plethora and symptomatic hyperviscosity (eg, poor feeding, lethargy, irritability). Fetal hypoxia also induces hyperplasia of the pancreatic islets and increased insulin production, leading to neonatal hypoglycemia.  Option A (Transient tachypnea of the newborn) is incorrect. It typically presents with respiratory distress (eg, tachypnea, grunting, nasal flaring, retractions) shortly after birth in term or late preterm infants. Chest x-ray shows hyperinflation and prominent perihilar streaking.  Option B (Intraventricular hemorrhage) is incorrect. It is most common in premature infants, typically presenting with abrupt deterioration (eg, lethargy, hypotonia, seizures) and rapidly progressive, severe illness.   Option D (Congenital heart disease) is usually accompanied by other symptoms such as cyanosis, heart murmurs, or signs of heart failure (eg, hepatomegaly, respiratory distress).  Option E (Intrauterine hypoxia) is incorrect. Although maternal smoking can lead to intrauterine hypoxia, it does not directly cause the clinical findings in the newborn. Hypoxia can lead to polycythemia and hypoglycemia, which are due to adaptation mechanisms (increased erythropoiesis and insulin secretion, respectively) rather than the hypoxia itself.

This patientâs epigastric pain that worsens with meals, early satiety, and bloating are suggestive of peptic ulcer disease (PUD). PUD is most commonly caused by Helicobacter pylori and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Other risk factors include smoking, alcohol, and physiological stress. Her recent diet history of consuming large volumes of caffeinated drinks and fast food are also contributing to her symptoms. The most appropriate next step in the management of patients with symptoms of PUD, like this patient, is a trial of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) like omeprazole (choice D). PPIs suppress gastric acid secretion, providing an environment for ulcer healing and symptom relief.  Upper endoscopy (choice A) is not indicated as an initial diagnostic test for PUD in patients who are younger than 55 years old and have no alarm symptoms (eg, weight loss, recurrent vomiting, dysphagia, evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, early satiety). Barium swallow radiograph (choice B) is not as sensitive or specific as upper endoscopy for diagnosing PUD. Fecal antigen testing for Helicobacter pylori (choice C) and treatment with metoclopramide (choice E), a prokinetic agent that enhances gastric emptying, would not be the best initial approach for this patient without alarm symptoms.

The patient's history of chronic ankle swelling that reduces with rest, varicosities, and skin changes (stasis dermatitis) in the setting of prior deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is suggestive of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). In CVI, dysfunction of the venous valves in the deep, superficial, or perforating veins leads to venous hypertension. This can cause edema, skin changes and, eventually, ulceration. Reflux (ie, reversal of blood flow direction) due to valve dysfunction is a common finding in CVI.   The great saphenous vein is the longest vein in the body and is commonly affected in CVI. Normally, blood flows from the superficial venous system (eg, great saphenous vein) into the deep system (eg, femoral vein) to return to the heart. Therefore, reversal of this flow (ie, 'Great saphenous vein to femoral vein' (Choice D)) would indicate venous insufficiency.  Flow from the 'Anterior tibial vein to popliteal vein' (Choice A), 'Femoral vein to external iliac vein' (Choice C), and 'Dorsal venous arch to great saphenous vein' (Choice E) are all normal flow directions.   Flow from the 'Popliteal vein to small saphenous vein' (Choice B) would indicate reflux, but this is less likely the cause of her symptoms because the small saphenous vein is in the posterior leg and would not typically cause medial ankle skin changes.

The correct answer is B. Cricopharyngeus and circular muscle of the esophagus.  This patient's symptoms of difficulty swallowing solids, regurgitation of undigested food, and halitosis (bad breath) are suggestive of Zenker's diverticulum. Zenker's diverticulum is a false diverticulum that develops in the posterior hypopharynx, between the cricopharyngeus muscle (superior part of the inferior constrictor of the pharynx) and the circular muscle of the esophagus. Over time, the diverticulum can expand and cause progressively worsening symptoms. The halitosis is due to stagnation of food in the diverticulum, leading to bacterial overgrowth and subsequent bad breath.  Option A is incorrect because the circular and longitudinal muscle layers of the esophagus are not the location of a Zenker's diverticulum. Both these layers are part of the esophageal wall, not the transition zone where the diverticulum forms.  Option C is incorrect because the thyropharyngeus muscle is not involved in the formation of a Zenker's diverticulum. The thyropharyngeus is part of the middle pharyngeal constrictor muscle, located superior to the cricopharyngeus muscle.  Option D is incorrect because the superior and inferior pharyngeal constrictors are not involved in the formation of a Zenker's diverticulum. These muscles form the side and back walls of the throat, not the transition zone where the diverticulum forms.  Option E is incorrect because a Zenker's diverticulum does not form between two parts of the cricopharyngeus muscle. It forms between the cricopharyngeus and the circular muscle of the esophagus.

The correct answer is B. Intravenous regular insulin.   Gestational diabetes (GD) is associated with fetal macrosomia, increased risk of birth trauma, and neonatal hypoglycemia. It is important to manage GD with blood glucose control which reduces the risk of these complications. During labor, women with GD should be managed with a combined infusion of dextrose and insulin to maintain a blood glucose level between 70-110 mg/dL.   Option A, 5% dextrose, is a part of management but it should be combined with insulin. Administering dextrose alone may contribute to hyperglycemia without the insulin to allow it to be utilized.  Option C, 25% magnesium sulphate, is used for seizure prophylaxis in pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, not indicated in this patient.  Option D, Erythrocyte mass, would be used in cases of severe anemia, but this patient's Hb is within the normal range for a pregnant woman.  Option E, subcutaneous insulin, is used for long-term control of diabetes but during labor, intravenous regular insulin is preferred for its rapid onset and short duration of action, allowing for quick adjustments based on blood glucose monitoring.   This patient's fasting glucose and HbA1c levels are elevated, indicating poor glycemic control, and the baby's estimated weight is at the high end of normal, suggesting potential macrosomia, both of which are common in poorly controlled GD. These factors support the choice of intravenous regular insulin to manage her blood glucose levels during labor.

The correct answer is E. Absorption of 7?-dehydroxylated bile will decrease.   The terminal ileum is the primary site of bile salt absorption. When a significant length of ileum is resected, as in this patient, the body's ability to absorb bile salts is compromised. 7?-dehydroxylated bile acids, the major components of bile salts, are absorbed in the terminal ileum. Because they are not being absorbed as efficiently, fecal loss of bile salts will increase.  Now, let's consider why the other options are incorrect.  A: Vitamin K is absorbed in the terminal ileum, similar to bile salts, so its absorption could be impaired after an ileal resection.   B: The synthesis of cholesterol in the liver is not related to the absorption of bile salts in the ileum. Therefore, liver cholesterol synthesis is not expected to decrease after an ileal resection.  C: The balance of the components in bile is maintained by the liver and gallbladder, not the ileum. Thus, ileal resection does not directly alter the composition of bile.  D: The bacterial population in the small intestine could potentially be affected by an ileal resection. If bile salts are not being absorbed as efficiently, more will remain in the intestine, which could affect the types and quantities of bacteria present.

This patient's irregularly irregular pulse and absence of P waves on ECG suggest a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF). Because atrial contraction is absent in AF, blood can stagnate and form a clot, or thrombus, within the atria. The left atrial appendage is particularly susceptible to thrombus formation due to its complex structure with areas of blood flow stasis. This is concerning because if a thrombus dislodges and embolizes, it may lead to a stroke.  Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a highly sensitive and specific method for detecting thrombus in the left atrium and appendage. During a TEE, the patient swallows an ultrasound probe, which is then positioned in the esophagus directly posterior to the heart. This provides excellent images of the posterior cardiac structures, such as the left atrium and left atrial appendage. Therefore, the answer is 'Thrombus in the left atrial appendage' (Option D).  Option A: The left pulmonary artery is best visualized by a chest CT with contrast, not TEE. Option B: While a TEE can be used to visualize a myxoma in the left atrium, this patient's presentation does not suggest a myxoma. Option C: An aneurysm of the descending aorta is better visualized by a CT scan or MRI. Option E: A tumor in the right main bronchus would best be visualized by a bronchoscopy or a CT scan of the chest.

The correct answer is E, 'No vaccination'.   This patient's history of HIV infection places him at increased risk for several vaccine-preventable diseases. However, because of his consistently good response to antiretroviral therapy and a CD4+ count above 200/mm3, he should receive vaccinations according to the standard adult immunization schedule, with exceptions for certain vaccines.   In his case, given the fact that he has a good immune response to the hepatitis B vaccine (anti-HBs >10 mIU/mL), a history of chicken pox (no need for varicella vaccine), and a recent tetanus and diphtheria booster (within 10 years), there is currently no indication for further vaccinations.   Regarding the other options,  Option A, Hepatitis B vaccine is not needed as he had already received three doses and also has evidence of immunity. Option B, the Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine is not generally recommended for adults and is contraindicated in HIV-infected individuals because it is a live, attenuated vaccine. Option C, Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine and is contraindicated in patients with HIV and a CD4+ count <200/mm3. However, this would not be a routine recommendation given his past medical history. Option D, Yellow fever vaccine is a live virus vaccine and is typically indicated for travelers to endemic areas. However, Thailand is not an endemic area for yellow fever. Additionally, the vaccine may pose a risk to HIV-infected individuals with CD4 counts <200/mm3.

The most likely cause of this patient's bleeding is 'C' - Chorionic villi invading into the myometrium.   This condition is known as placenta accreta, a severe obstetric complication occurring when the placenta attaches too deeply into the uterine wall. Normally, the chorionic villi attach to the decidua basalis, the functional layer of the endometrium in pregnancy. However, in cases like placenta accreta, they invade beyond this layer and into the myometrium. This can lead to severe bleeding at the time of attempted placental delivery, as is seen in this patient. Risk factors for placenta accreta include advanced maternal age, multiparity, and prior cesarean delivery.  Option 'A' - Chorionic villi attaching to the decidua basalis is the normal attachment site of the placenta and would not cause this patient's bleeding.  Option 'B' - Chorionic villi attaching to the myometrium is incorrect as the chorionic villi do not 'attach' to the myometrium, they 'invade' it. Attachment to the myometrium is not a known cause of postpartum hemorrhage.  Option 'D' - Chorionic villi invading into the serosa, describes a condition known as placenta percreta, a severe form of placenta accreta where the placenta penetrates through the entire uterine wall and can attach to other organs. This is less likely given the absence of severe intraabdominal bleeding or signs of hemodynamic instability in this patient.  Option 'E' - Placental implantation over internal cervical os, describes placenta previa, which presents with painless third-trimester bleeding. This patient's bleeding is postpartum, not antepartum, making placenta previa an unlikely diagnosis.

The answer is E. Inferior division of the left middle cerebral artery.  The patient's symptoms are consistent with a stroke affecting the dominant hemisphere, which in a right-handed person is typically the left hemisphere. The symptoms of decreased sensation to light touch on the right leg, and weakness on her left leg and foot indicate a lesion affecting the motor and sensory cortex. This location correlates with an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery, specifically its inferior division. In addition to motor and sensory defects, patients with left middle cerebral artery strokes may also experience aphasia and/or neglect, both of which are apparent in this patient.  The other options are incorrect:  Option A (Right anterior cerebral artery) is incorrect because occlusion of this artery usually leads to contralateral lower limb deficits, with minimal upper limb involvement. This patient's deficits are not confined to the lower limb.  Option B (Right middle cerebral artery stem (M1)) and Option C (Superior division of the right middle cerebral artery) are incorrect because occlusion of these areas would likely cause left-sided deficits, not right-sided deficits as seen in this patient.  Option D (Inferior division of the right middle cerebral artery) is incorrect because occlusion of this area would likely cause left-sided deficits, not right-sided deficits as seen in this patient. Additionally, this patient's diminished speech (aphasia) points towards a lesion in the dominant hemisphere, which is typically the left hemisphere in right-handed individuals.

This patient's intravenous drug use, weight loss, fatigue, and ongoing cough are concerning for tuberculosis (TB), which is more common in populations with close living quarters and impaired immunity. The first-line treatment for active TB includes isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Optic neuritis (Option C), presenting as color vision changes, visual acuity decrease, and visual field defects, may be caused by ethambutol. Thus, optic neuritis is a main indication to discontinue or change TB treatment regimen.  Let's discuss why other options are incorrect: - Elevated liver enzymes (Option A) are commonly seen with isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide use. However, mild liver function test abnormalities are often monitored without a change in treatment unless there are symptoms of hepatitis (eg, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice). - Hyperuricemia (Option B) can be caused by pyrazinamide, but is generally asymptomatic and does not necessitate discontinuing treatment. - Isoniazid can cause peripheral neuropathy (Option D), but this is typically prevented with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation. If peripheral neuropathy does occur, isoniazid may be stopped, but the treatment regimen as a whole would likely continue. - Red body excretions (Option E) are a harmless side effect of rifampin and do not require discontinuation of treatment.

This infant's dysmorphic features (microcephaly), ocular abnormalities (posterior uveitis), neurologic signs (lethargy, poor feeding, seizures), and imaging findings (ventriculomegaly, intracerebral calcifications) suggest a congenital infection. The most common congenital infections are grouped under the acronym TORCH (Toxoplasmosis, Other [syphilis, varicella-zoster, parvovirus B19], Rubella, Cytomegalovirus [CMV], Herpes). Of these, CMV is the most common and is associated with the symptoms exhibited by this infant. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Congenital cytomegalovirus infection.  A (Congenital Treponema pallidum infection) is incorrect because although it can cause hepatosplenomegaly, rash, and bone changes seen at birth, the neurologic findings usually present later in infancy or early childhood.  C (Congenital rubella infection) is incorrect because it typically presents with cataracts, sensorineural hearing loss, and cardiac defects (eg, patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary artery stenosis), not with the symptoms described.  D (Congenital parvovirus infection) can lead to nonimmune hydrops fetalis in the fetus, but it's not associated with the neurologic and ocular findings seen in this infant.  E (Congenital Toxoplasma gondii infection) is incorrect because even though it can present with intracranial calcifications, chorioretinitis, and hydrocephalus, there's typically an associated history of raw or undercooked meat consumption, living in a region with high prevalence, or exposure to cat feces during pregnancy. This case does not provide such a history.

The correct answer is C. 'Seek a court order for medical treatment of the son'.   In general, parents are permitted to make medical decisions on behalf of their minor children. However, when a parent's decision places a child's life in immediate danger due to refusal of a life-saving treatment (such as refusal of a blood transfusion in an exsanguinating patient), physicians are legally and ethically justified in seeking court intervention to override parental refusal. In this case, the court usually sides with the physician in interest of preserving the life of the child.  Option A: Consult hospital ethics committee for medical treatment of the son - While consulting an ethics committee may be appropriate in some situations, it is likely too time-consuming in this emergency situation.  Option B: Proceed to surgery on the son without transfusion - This could place the child's life at immediate risk.   Option D: Transfuse packed red blood cells to the son but not to father - The father, as an adult, has the capacity to refuse medical treatment for himself. However, the child's life is in immediate danger and a transfusion should not be withheld simply due to parental religious belief.  Option E: Wait for the son's mother before providing further treatment - Waiting could put the child's life at unnecessary risk. In this type of emergency situation, delaying treatment could lead to significant harm or death of the child.

This patient's symptoms of fatigue, reduced libido, joint pain, small testes, and skin hyperpigmentation as well as hepatomegaly and Prussian blue staining of liver biopsy are suggestive of hereditary hemochromatosis. This is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by increased intestinal absorption of dietary iron, which is deposited in the tissues causing damage and organ dysfunction. Affected organs include the liver (cirrhosis), skin (hyperpigmentation), heart (restrictive cardiomyopathy), pancreas (diabetes), and pituitary (hypogonadism). Hereditary hemochromatosis also increases the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, but only in the presence of cirrhosis. This patient does not have cirrhosis but does have hepatomegaly due to iron deposition.   The other options can be explained as follows: A. Colorectal carcinoma: There is no direct association between hereditary hemochromatosis and colorectal carcinoma. B. Restrictive cardiomyopathy: This is a potential complication of hereditary hemochromatosis but is much less common than hepatocellular carcinoma. C. Rheumatoid arthritis: The joint involvement in this case is more indicative of pseudogout or osteoarthritis, both of which can be complications of hereditary hemochromatosis. Rheumatoid arthritis is not associated with this condition. D. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma: There is no direct association between hereditary hemochromatosis and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. E. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma: There is no direct association between hereditary hemochromatosis and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  So, the correct answer is 'A': Colorectal carcinoma.

The most ideal donor for organ transplant is usually one whose human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype matches that of the recipient as closely as possible. HLA are proteins found on the surface of most cells in your body. Your immune system uses these proteins to recognize which cells belong in your body and which do not. When an organ, such as a kidney, is transplanted from one person to another, the immune system will attack the transplant if the HLA proteins on its cells are too different from those on the cells of the recipient.  For this particular patient, the correct answer is 'E': Donor C: A7/A4, B2/B4, C8/C3. Donor C shares one allele at each locus (A7, B2, and C8) with the patient, making them the closest match.  The other donors are less ideal:  - Donor D has only one match at the C locus (C8), but no matches at the A or B loci. - Donor E has one match at the A locus (A7) and one at the C locus (C3), but none at the B locus. - Donor A has no matching alleles with the patient. The alleles are the same but they are in reverse order, which constitutes a mismatch. - Donor B has only one match at each of the A (A5) and C (C3) loci, but none at B.   Thus, Donor C is the best match for this patient because they share the most alleles.

This patient's altered mental status, hypertension, bradycardia, and irregular respirations (Cushing triad) are concerning for increased intracranial pressure (ICP) due to a space-occupying lesion (eg, epidural or subdural hematoma) from his bike accident. Initial management of increased ICP includes rapid sequence intubation for airway protection and to allow for control of ventilation, head elevation to 30 degrees to promote venous outflow, and sedation and analgesia to reduce agitation, which can increase ICP. Hypertonic saline or mannitol can be used to reduce brain edema. Ventilation should be adjusted to maintain a normal partial pressure of carbon dioxide, as hypocapnia (commonly caused by hyperventilation) can reduce ICP but may lead to cerebral ischemia. Hyperventilation should therefore be used in the short term only for impending herniation.   The best option is therefore 'B': 'Head elevation, sedation, hypertonic saline, hypoventilation'.   The other options are incorrect or less ideal because:  A) Norepinephrine is not typically used in the initial management of elevated ICP. Hyperventilation is a temporizing measure for herniation and not typically used first line. C) Hyperventilation is a temporizing measure for herniation and not typically used first line. D) Lowering the head would increase ICP, which is the opposite of the desired effect. Hyperventilation is a temporizing measure for herniation and not typically used first line. E) Lowering the head would increase ICP, which is the opposite of the desired effect. Hyperventilation is a temporizing measure for herniation and not typically used first line.

This patient's severe abdominal pain, elevated amylase, and metabolic acidosis (low HCO3) strongly suggest a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (Choice E).   The most common causes of acute pancreatitis are gallstones and alcohol abuse, but there are many other etiologies. This patient has multiple risk factors, including age >65 years, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and a significant smoking history (he has a 50-pack-year history). In addition, his use of omeprazole suggests that he may also have dyspepsia and/or gastroesophageal reflux disease, other risk factors for pancreatitis.   The other options can be ruled out for several reasons:   Peptic ulcer perforation (Choice A) would be accompanied by peritoneal signs (eg, rebound tenderness, guarding), which this patient does not have.   Acute cholecystitis (Choice B) would present with right upper quadrant pain, fever, and possibly a positive Murphy's sign; this patient's pain is diffuse rather than localized to the right upper quadrant.   Acute mesenteric ischemia (Choice C) is a possibility given the patient's atrial fibrillation, but it typically presents with "pain out of proportion to physical findings" rather than the diffuse tenderness seen here.   Finally, diabetic ketoacidosis (Choice D) can cause abdominal pain and metabolic acidosis, but it is less likely in this patient given the absence of hyperglycemia and other symptoms (eg, polyuria, polydipsia). The presence of an elevated amylase also makes this diagnosis less likely.

The most correct answer is D - "Disorganized proliferation of mature thyroid cells".  Anaplasia is a term used in histopathology to describe cells that lack differentiation (i.e., they have lost the morphological characteristics of mature cells), and often have the ability to metastasize. It is a hallmark of malignant neoplasms (cancers). In other words, anaplasia refers to cells that have lost their original structure and function, and have an irregular, often disorganized growth pattern.   Now let's discuss why the other options are incorrect:  Option A: Negative staining for thyroglobulin - Thyroglobulin is a glycoprotein produced by the thyroid gland. While a negative staining for thyroglobulin might indicate that the cells in the tumor are not thyroid cells, it does not necessarily indicate anaplasia.  Option B: Replacement of thyroid cells by normal squamous epithelium - This would be more indicative of a process like metaplasia or normal tissue regeneration, not anaplasia.  Option C: Reduced number of functional thyroid cells - While a reduced number of functional thyroid cells could result from anaplasia, it could also be caused by a number of other conditions that affect the thyroid, such as autoimmune diseases or radiation exposure.  Option E: Increased expression of thyroid transcription factor-1 - Increased expression of a transcription factor like TTF-1 could be indicative of a number of processes, including both normal and abnormal growth. It does not specifically indicate anaplasia.

This boy's pallor, jaundice, and family history of blood transfusions suggest a diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis (HS). This condition is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by defects in erythrocyte membrane proteins (ankyrin, band 3, protein 4.2, spectrin, or pallidin). These defects lead to loss of membrane surface area, resulting in spherically shaped erythrocytes (spherocytes) which have decreased deformability, and are prematurely sequestered and destroyed by the spleen, leading to hemolytic anemia. Additional findings in HS can include splenomegaly and cholelithiasis, secondary to chronic hemolysis. HS is often unmasked during times of oxidative stress, such as during an infection (as in this patient), which can precipitate an aplastic crisis. On peripheral smear, spherocytes (option E) are seen. These cells are small and lack central pallor.  Codocytes (option A), also known as target cells, are seen in conditions of decreased RBC turnover (eg, thalassemia, iron deficiency, post-splenectomy). Degmacytes, or "bite cells" (option B), are typically seen in G6PD deficiency, a condition that can cause hemolysis following oxidative stress. Echinocytes, or "burr cells" (option C), are seen in kidney disease and liver disease. Finally, schistocytes (option D), or fragmented cells, are seen in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia such as disseminated intravascular coagulation or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

This patient's history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and smoking, in combination with his symptoms of pain in the legs that worsens with walking and is relieved with rest, is suggestive of peripheral artery disease (PAD). PAD is caused by atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities and presents as intermittent claudication. Intermittent claudication is characterized by pain in the lower extremities that is reproduced with exertion and relieved with rest. The diagnosis of PAD is established by an ankle-brachial index (ABI) <0.90 at rest or decrease in the ABI by >20% following exercise (Choice A).   Choice B: Cilostazol is a medication used to treat intermittent claudication in patients with PAD. However, you need to confirm the diagnosis first before starting the treatment.  Choice C: CT angiography of the lower extremities is a diagnostic modality that can be used when the diagnosis of PAD is uncertain after the ABI or when revascularization is being considered. However, it is not the initial diagnostic test.  Choice D: Epidural corticosteroid injection is used to treat radicular pain, not intermittent claudication.  Choice E: MRI of the spine is indicated in patients with back pain suggestive of a more severe etiology such as cancer, infection, fracture or cauda equina. This patient's symptoms are not suggestive of these conditions.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is Schizophrenia (Answer D). This patient's symptoms of delusions (government spying on him), disorganized behavior (running around the park naked), disorganized speech (talks non-stop, third person reference), and negative symptoms (gaunt appearance likely due to self-neglect) that have been present for several years are indicative of schizophrenia. According to the DSM-5, the diagnosis of schizophrenia requires the presence of at least two of the following symptoms for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated): delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, and negative symptoms. At least one of the symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months, which fits with this patient's medical history.  As for the other options: - Bipolar 1 disorder (option A) could explain his psychotic features and depression but there is no mention of manic episodes in his history. - A brief psychotic disorder (option B) is characterized by a sudden onset of psychotic symptoms that last more than 1 day but less than 1 month. - Schizoaffective disorder (option C) is a possibility but it requires concurrent, uninterrupted period of mood episode (e.g., major depressive episode) and active-phase symptoms of schizophrenia, which is not clearly seen in this case. - Major depressive disorder (option E) could account for the bouts of severe depression but doesn't explain the psychosis and disorganized behaviour seen in this patient.

The correct answer is A: Necrosis.  The patient's presentation is indicative of yellow fever, a mosquito-borne flavivirus endemic to tropical areas of Africa and South America. The initial 3-6 days after infection (infective period) are typically asymptomatic, followed by an abrupt onset of fever, chills, headache, and myalgias. After a brief remission, a second, more toxic phase may occur in some patients, manifesting as high fever, jaundice (due to hepatocellular damage), and hemorrhagic phenomena (eg, epigastric pain, vomiting, petechiae). Multiorgan dysfunction, including renal failure (as evidenced by anuria in this patient), can also occur.  The liver biopsy findings of eosinophilic (pink) degeneration and condensed nuclear chromatin within hepatocytes are features of necrosis, a form of cell death resulting from severe cell injury. Necrosis is characterized by cell and organelle swelling, breakdown of plasma and organelle membranes, and spillage of intracellular contents, which can cause inflammation. In contrast, apoptosis (option C) is a process of programmed cell death that does not release cellular contents and therefore generally does not cause inflammation.  Steatosis (option E) refers to the abnormal retention of lipids within a cell and is not indicated in this scenario. Regeneration (option B) and proliferation (option D) refer to processes of cell growth and division that occur in response to injury or loss of cells. These processes would not result in the pathologic findings seen in this patient's hepatocytes.

The most likely explanation for this patients symptoms is 'D': 'Neurosyphilis'. Neurosyphilis typically presents with a multitude of neurological symptoms including altered mental status and seizure-like activity. This patient's past medical history of syphilis, even though adequately treated, puts her at an increased risk for neurosyphilis. The CSF findings of lymphocytic pleocytosis and increased protein are characteristic of neurosyphilis, further supporting the diagnosis.  Option 'A': Brain abscess would most likely show focal neurologic signs related to the area of the brain affected, and this patient's symptoms are more generalized. Additionally, the CSF study would likely show neutrophilic pleocytosis, not lymphocytic.  Option 'B': Infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) often presents with fever, headache, and altered mental status, but temporal lobe involvement typically results in characteristic findings on neuroimaging, such as temporal lobe edema or hemorrhage, which was not seen in this patient.  Option 'C': Infection with Streptococcal pneumoniae often results in bacterial meningitis. The CSF findings in bacterial meningitis usually show a high neutrophil count, low glucose levels, and high protein levels.  Option 'E': Undiagnosed bipolar disorder could explain the patient's reported abnormal behavior, but it does not explain the fever, altered mental status, or the CSF findings. Additionally, the physical findings of neck stiffness suggest a central nervous system infection.

Without more information about the patient's symptoms or the CT scan results, it's hard to provide a definitive answer. However, given the patient's elevated blood pressure and pulse, the most appropriate next step might be intravenous labetalol therapy (Option B).   This is because labetalol is a medication used to lower blood pressure in hypertensive crises, which this patient might be experiencing given his high blood pressure and elevated pulse rate.   Option A, decompressive surgery, involves removing part of the skull to relieve pressure on the brain. This would typically be reserved for severe cases of brain injury or swelling, which we cannot confirm from the information given.  Option C, oral aspirin therapy, is often used for its antiplatelet effect in the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular disease, which doesn't seem to be the immediate issue here.  Option D, intravenous alteplase therapy, is used to dissolve blood clots in conditions such as ischemic stroke or heart attack. Again, without more information on the patient's symptoms and CT scan results, it's hard to say if this is the right course of action.  Option E, surgical clipping, is a procedure used to treat brain aneurysms. Unless the CT scan result showed an aneurysm, this would not be the most appropriate next step.   Of course, without more information, these are mostly educated guesses. The answer could change depending on additional details.

This patient's symptoms of clubbing (gradual enlargement of fingertips with increased convexity of the nail fold), hoarse voice, and non-resolving wheeze are suggestive of a paraneoplastic syndrome secondary to underlying lung cancer. Clubbing is typically associated with lung malignancies, as well as other conditions such as interstitial lung disease, congenital heart disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. The hoarse voice could be due to recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy secondary to a tumor in the superior sulcus (Pancoast tumor) or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Wheezing is often associated with obstruction of the airways, which can also be caused by a lung tumor.  The most likely radiographic finding in this case would be 'D: Reticular opacities on chest x-ray'. This could indicate an underlying mass, consolidation, or interstitial changes associated with lung cancer.  The other choices are less likely:  A: Increased serum ADH (antidiuretic hormone) occurs in syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion, often due to small cell lung cancer, which would present with symptoms of hyponatremia, including nausea, headache, seizures, or altered mental status.  B: Miosis (constricted pupils) is not associated with lung cancer or clubbing. It is typically seen in opiate use or Horner syndrome.  C: Increased serum ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) could suggest sarcoidosis, but this patient's presentation is not consistent with that disease.  E: Peripheral cyanosis (blue discoloration of the extremities) suggests poor perfusion or oxygenation, which is not indicated in this case.

The correct answer is D. Malignant mesothelioma.  This patient's history of working in a shipyard for several decades combined with his symptoms and radiographic findings of diffuse bilateral infiltrates, pleural reticulonodular opacities, pleural plaques, and subpleural linear opacities suggest asbestos exposure. Asbestos exposure is most commonly associated with shipbuilding, roofing, and plumbing. The most common pulmonary findings in patients with asbestos exposure are pleural plaques, which are areas of fibrous thickening of the pleura that can be seen on x-ray or CT. However, these plaques do not correlate with the extent of exposure and do not result in impaired lung function.  The most serious complication of asbestos exposure is malignant mesothelioma, a rare and aggressive cancer that primarily affects the pleura. This risk is synergistically increased with concomitant tobacco smoke exposure. Other pulmonary conditions associated with asbestos exposure include asbestosis (fibrosis of the lungs due to asbestos) and bronchogenic carcinoma.  Bronchogenic carcinoma (option A) is less likely in this patient despite his heavy smoking history because the radiographic findings are more consistent with asbestos exposure. Aspergilloma (option B) and mycobacterial infection (option C) are less likely because these typically present with more acute symptoms and signs of infection, which this patient does not have. Spontaneous pneumothorax (option E) is also less likely because this typically presents with acute-onset chest pain and dyspnea.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is Cocaine intoxication (Option A). The patient has a positive urine test for cocaine and is displaying symptoms that are common with cocaine use such as increased heart rate and rapid, high-volume speech. Cocaine is a powerful stimulant that can produce effects such as euphoria, increased energy, talkativeness, and visual hallucinations.   Option B, an illusion, is a misperception or misinterpretation of a real external stimulus, such as seeing something in the clouds that isn't actually there. However, this patient's symptoms are not consistent with a simple misinterpretation of an external stimulus; his visual experiences are entirely generated by his mind, reflecting a hallucination rather than an illusion.  Option C, Visual hallucination, while present in this case, is a symptom rather than a diagnosis. It is important to identify the underlying cause of the hallucinations, which here is most likely cocaine intoxication.  Option D, delusion, is a fixed, false belief held with strong conviction despite superior evidence to the contrary. However, the patient does not exhibit any such beliefs.  Option E, Alcohol withdrawal, can produce visual hallucinations, but the patient's alcohol test is positive, indicating current use rather than withdrawal. Furthermore, alcohol withdrawal hallucinations are typically simple and transient, unlike the complex, persistent hallucinations described here.   Overall, the symptoms and positive urine test for cocaine suggest that this patient is experiencing cocaine intoxication.

The clinical picture and imaging is suggestive of an epidural hematoma (EDH), which is a neurosurgical emergency. Epidural hematomas typically occur after a fracture of the skull during a traumatic event. The fracture damages the middle meningeal artery leading to rapid accumulation of arterial blood between the dura and the skull. The hematoma can compress the brain and shift the midline structures, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure and herniation. The classic clinical presentation of an EDH is a brief loss of consciousness (concussion), followed by a lucid interval, and then progressive loss of consciousness and neurologic symptoms. These symptoms occur due to continued bleeding and increasing intracranial pressure. The CT scan findings typically show a convex or lentiform hematoma that does not cross the suture lines. The treatment of choice is immediate surgical evacuation of the hematoma to decrease the intracranial pressure and prevent herniation. Therefore, the answer is 'B' Surgical evacuation of the clots.  Now, option 'A' Administration of levetiracetam is incorrect because it is used to prevent seizures but there is no evidence of seizures in this patient. Option 'C' Lumbar puncture is contraindicated in patients with increased intracranial pressure as it can lead to brain herniation. Option 'D' Decompressive craniectomy is used in cases of extremely high intracranial pressure that did not respond to other measures, or in cases of massive brain infarction, but this is not the case here. Option 'E' Administration of methylprednisolone is used in acute spinal cord injury, which is not indicated in this patient.

The patient is likely taking metformin, which is a biguanide used to treat type 2 diabetes. A common side effect of metformin is lactic acidosis. Therefore, the answer is 'B': Lactic acidosis.  Explanation:  The symptoms of flushing, nausea, and palpitations that the patient experiences after consuming alcohol is indicative of a disulfiram-like reaction, which is a common side effect of sulfonylureas, a class of drugs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The drug from this class which is most commonly associated with this side effect is chlorpropamide.   If the physician switched the patient to a different drug that targets the same pathway (i.e., reducing blood glucose levels), but at a different binding site, a reasonable choice would be metformin, which is a biguanide.  Metformin primarily works by decreasing hepatic glucose production and increasing insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. It does not cause hypoglycemia or disulfiram-like reactions. However, a well-known, though rare, side effect of metformin is lactic acidosis, especially in patients with impaired renal function.  Options 'A': Hepatotoxicity,'C': Pancreatitis,'D': Urinary tract infection, and 'E': Weight gain are possible side effects of other antidiabetic medications but not typically associated with metformin.

This patient's history of drug abuse, along with his symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea, decreased exercise tolerance, and an S3 gallop on physical examination, strongly suggest a diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by dilatation of the ventricles and impaired systolic function, leading to heart failure. Chronic cocaine use is a recognized cause of dilated cardiomyopathy.   Option 'C' Radiation therapy, can also cause dilated cardiomyopathy. Radiation induces fibrosis and vascular injury, which can result in myocardial damage and eventually cardiomyopathy.   Option 'A' Amyloid production can cause restrictive cardiomyopathy, not dilated. In this case, amyloid protein is deposited in the heart tissue, causing stiffness and preventing the ventricles from properly filling with blood.   Option 'B' Myosin mutation, is associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, not dilated. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is characterized by asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, often with greatest involvement of the interventricular septum.  Option 'D' Turner syndrome, is associated with coarctation of the aorta and bicuspid aortic valve, not dilated cardiomyopathy.  Option 'E' Vitamin B1 deficiency, also known as beriberi, can cause wet beriberi, which is characterized by high output heart failure, not dilated cardiomyopathy. The high output failure is due to peripheral vasodilation and increased venous return, not a primary issue with the myocardium itself.  So, the answer is 'C' Radiation therapy.

The patient's chief complaint is a dry, persistent cough, which developed after the start of lisinopril therapy. The adverse effect of ACE inhibitors, such as lisinopril, is a dry, persistent cough which is due to elevated levels of bradykinin secondary to inhibition of its breakdown. Therefore, option 'A' (Serum levels of bradykinin will be elevated) is the most likely explanation for this patient's chief complaint.  Here's why the other options are incorrect: Option 'B': Loratadine is an antihistamine used to treat allergic symptoms such as runny nose, itching, and sneezing. It would not be effective in this case as the patient's cough is not allergy-related. Option 'C': Beta agonists are used to treat asthma by relaxing bronchial smooth muscle. This patient's cough is not due to asthma. Option 'D': Non-caseating granulomas on biopsy of mediastinal lymph nodes would be suggestive of sarcoidosis or other granulomatous diseases, but there's no indication of such conditions in this patient. Option 'E': Omeprazole is used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and other conditions involving excessive stomach acid. While the patient does mention a burning sensation in her sternum during meals, her chief complaint is the dry cough, which is not related to GERD.

This patient's tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in the setting of a low TSH and an elevated total T4 suggest hyperthyroidism. One common cause of hyperthyroidism in women of childbearing age is Graves' disease. The most specific test for Graves' disease is the thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb) test (option E). TRAb is an autoantibody that stimulates the thyrotropin receptor, leading to unregulated production of thyroid hormone.   Let's discuss why the other options are not as useful: - Total triiodothyronine (T3) levels (option A) are often elevated in hyperthyroidism, but are less specific than TRAb for Graves' disease.  - Free thyroxine (T4) levels (option B) are already suggested to be elevated based on the total T4 level, and would be elevated in any type of hyperthyroidism. - Elevated thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) levels (option C) can increase total T4 levels, but free T4 and TSH levels would be normal, which is not the case in this patient. - Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies (option D) are seen in many autoimmune thyroid diseases, including Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, but they are not specific to Graves' disease. They can also be found in euthyroid patients.

This patient's history of recurrent pregnancy loss, thrombosis, and diffuse joint discomfort suggests the presence of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), a hypercoagulable state associated with both arterial and venous thrombosis. APS is defined by the presence of =1 clinical criteria (vascular thrombosis, pregnancy morbidity) and =1 laboratory criteria (presence of lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody, or anti-ß2-glycoprotein I antibody on =2 occasions at least 12 weeks apart). Pregnancy morbidity includes =1 unexplained deaths of a morphologically normal fetus at =10 weeks' gestation, =1 premature births of a morphologically normal neonate at <34 weeks of gestation due to eclampsia, severe preeclampsia, or placental insufficiency, or =3 unexplained consecutive spontaneous abortions at <10 weeks' gestation. APS is also associated with livedo reticularis, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia. Elevated activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) due to lupus anticoagulant is common but may not be present in all patients with APS. Therefore, the answer is D, 'Positive antihistone antibodies'.  Option A: Elevated TSH levels are associated with hypothyroidism, which can lead to menstrual irregularities, but does not typically cause recurrent pregnancy loss.  Option B: Autosomal dominant mutation in factor V (Factor V Leiden) increases the risk of venous thrombosis but is not associated with recurrent pregnancy loss.   Option C: Positive VDRL is a screening test for syphilis. Congenital syphilis can cause stillbirth, but it does not cause maternal thrombosis or joint discomfort.   Option E: Vasoconstriction with reduced placental blood flow can contribute to intrauterine growth restriction and preeclampsia but does not typically cause recurrent pregnancy loss.

The most appropriate course of action in this case would be 'D: Add glyburide to the medication regimen'. This patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus has poor glycemic control, as evidenced by her elevated hemoglobin A1c of 9.8% (normal <7% in diabetic patients). When diet, weight loss, and monotherapy with metformin fail to achieve the glycemic target, as in this patient, the next step is to add a second oral agent to the treatment regimen. Glyburide, a sulfonylurea, is a common choice for a second agent.  Options 'A: Refer the patient to a dietician', 'B: Schedule more frequent follow-up visits', and 'C: Refer the patient to an endocrinologist' are not the best choices as the patient's primary issue is poor glycemic control, which needs to be addressed by adjusting her medication regimen. While nutritional counseling and more frequent follow-ups may be beneficial, they are not the primary interventions needed given her high A1c. Referral to an endocrinologist would not be the first step in management in a case like this; adjustments to the medication regimen can typically be managed by the primary care physician.  Option 'E: Stop metformin and begin an insulin regimen' is not the best choice because insulin is not typically the first line of treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes. Insulin is usually reserved for patients who cannot achieve glycemic control despite multiple oral agents, or for patients with symptomatic hyperglycemia.

The patient's clinical picture is consistent with coarctation of the aorta, a congenital heart defect characterized by a narrowing of the aorta. This condition leads to hypertension in the upper body (as seen in the right arm/left arm pressure measurements above), hypotension in the lower body (as seen in the right leg/left leg pressure measurements), and weak/delayed femoral pulses. The murmur heard in the interscapular area further supports the notion of coarctation.  The most appropriate next step in management is echocardiography (Answer C). This test will provide an assessment of the structure and function of the heart, and can confirm the diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta.  Administration of alprostadil (Answer A) is a treatment for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), which keeps the ductus arteriosus open to help improve blood flow. It is not applicable to this patient's condition.   Arteriogram (Answer B) is an invasive procedure that is not typically the first-line diagnostic test in newborns with suspected congenital heart disease.  Indomethacin (Answer D) is used to close a patent ductus arteriosus, which is not the issue in this case.  Lower extremity Doppler (Answer E) would detect blood flow problems in the lower extremities, but it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms in this case, which is the suspected coarctation of the aorta.

The most likely diagnosis is myelofibrosis (not an option) or aplastic anemia (option B). The presence of the epidural mass (extramedullary hematopoiesis), anemia, and signal changes on MRI are suggestive of bone marrow pathology. The marrow is being replaced by something, leading to extramedullary hematopoiesis, which is often seen in severe anemias, such as myelofibrosis or aplastic anemia.  Option A, G6PD deficiency, would typically present with episodes of hemolytic anemia triggered by certain medications, infections, or fava beans. There's no evidence of hemolysis (eg, no increase in bilirubin), making this less likely.  Option C, Lead poisoning, usually presents with neurological symptoms (such as developmental delay or behavioral problems), abdominal pain, and anemia. However, it's not typically associated with extramedullary hematopoiesis or the MRI changes described.  Option D, Multiple myeloma, is a malignancy characterized by proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow. It typically occurs in older adults (over the age of 60) and presents with bone pain, anemia, renal failure, and hypercalcemia. It's extremely rare in children.  Option E, Beta-thalassemia, is a genetic disorder that results in the reduced synthesis of the beta-globin chains of hemoglobin, leading to microcytic anemia. It can cause extramedullary hematopoiesis, but the MCV (mean corpuscular volume) would be low (microcytic), making this less likely in this case.

This patient's presentation of recurrent angioedema without urticaria following exposure to ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) suggests a diagnosis of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema (ACEI-AE). ACEI-AE is due to the accumulation of bradykinin, a potent vasodilator, which can result in the rapid development of marked angioedema. Management involves discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor (Option D). In addition to discontinuation, acute episodes of AE can be treated with airway management and either C1 esterase inhibitor, ecallantide, or icatibant.  The other options are incorrect because they do not address the root cause of the angioedema.  Fresh frozen plasma (Option A) is used for hereditary angioedema, not ACEI-AE. It can potentially worsen or precipitate an attack of ACEI-AE due to the additional kininogen content.  Ecallantide (Option B) is a kallikrein inhibitor used for acute attacks of hereditary angioedema, not ACEI-AE.  Danazol (Option C) is an attenuated androgen that is used for long-term prophylaxis against attacks in patients with hereditary angioedema.  Prednisone (Option E) is a corticosteroid often used in the treatment of various allergic reactions, but it is not effective in ACEI-AE because histamine is not the main mediator in this condition.   Therefore, option D, discontinue lisinopril, is the correct answer as this drug is causing the AE. An alternative class of drug such as a calcium channel blocker or a thiazide diuretic should be used instead for hypertension management in this patient.

The symptoms experienced by this patient - lower abdominal pain, absence of urination for 24 hours, absence of bowel movement for over 3 days, and a palpable suprapubic mass - are all suggestive of acute urinary retention, which is frequently due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in older men. Acute urinary retention is a urologic emergency that needs immediate catheterization. This patient's symptom could be a side effect of Pregabalin (option B), which is a medication frequently used in the treatment of neuropathic pain, such as that caused by herpes zoster (shingles). Pregabalin has anticholinergic effects, which can lead to urinary retention, particularly in men with BPH.  Why the other options are wrong:  Simvastatin (option A) is a drug used to lower cholesterol levels and hence reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. It does not have urinary retention as a side effect.  Amlodipine (option C) is a calcium channel blocker used for treating hypertension and coronary artery disease. It does not cause urinary retention.  Valproate (option D) is used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder, and to prevent migraine headaches. It does not cause urinary retention.  Desipramine (option E) is a tricyclic antidepressant. While other tricyclic antidepressants can cause urinary retention due to their anticholinergic properties, desipramine is less likely to do so. Furthermore, there is no information given in the vignette that suggests this patient is receiving treatment for depression.

The patient's headache, loss of consciousness, and post-traumatic seizure suggest an acute subdural hematoma, which is most commonly caused by a rupture of bridging veins (Choice C). Subdural hematomas typically develop over the cerebral convexities due to tearing of the bridging veins that traverse the subdural space to drain into the dural sinuses. Bridging veins are particularly susceptible to rupture due to shearing forces during acceleration-deceleration injuries, such as falls. Elderly patients are at an increased risk due to cerebral atrophy, which stretches and makes more vulnerable the bridging veins.   Option A, Intracerebral hemorrhage, is less likely as this typically presents with focal neurological deficits related to the area of the brain affected. While this patient does have a gaze preference, this could be due to seizure activity.  Option B, Cerebrospinal fluid production/absorption mismatch, typically leads to hydrocephalus, which presents with headache, nausea and vomiting, but would not be expected to cause loss of consciousness or seizures.  Option D, Acute insufficiency of cerebral blood flow, could lead to a stroke which typically presents with focal neurological deficits and not loss of consciousness.  Option E, Bleeding between dura mater and skull, refers to an epidural hematoma, which is typically associated with a fracture of the skull, especially temporal bone fracture, and a period of lucidity, but this would typically last for hours and not just 15 minutes before symptoms develop.

This patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of nephrotic syndrome, characterized by peripheral edema and proteinuria >3.5 g/day. The renal biopsy findings of subepithelial deposits and a spike and dome pattern are characteristic of membranous nephropathy, a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. Membranous nephropathy can be either primary (idiopathic) or secondary. Secondary causes include drugs (eg, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, penicillamine), infections (eg, hepatitis B and C, syphilis, malaria), malignancies (eg, lung, colon, breast), autoimmune diseases (eg, lupus), and monoclonal gammopathies. Thus, the correct answer is E. Monoclonal protein spike is associated with this patient's condition.  Option A is incorrect as HIV infection is associated with other renal pathologies, such as HIV nephropathy, not typically membranous nephropathy. Option B is incorrect as High HbA1C is a marker of poor glycemic control in diabetes. Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease and typically presents with different biopsy findings (eg, mesangial expansion, nodular glomerulosclerosis). Option C is incorrect although Hepatitis B infection can be a cause of membranous nephropathy, it's not as specific as monoclonal gammopathy. Option D is incorrect as Hodgkin's lymphoma typically presents with lymphadenopathy, fatigue, weight loss, and night sweats. It is not typically associated with membranous nephropathy.

The patient is presenting with symptoms of diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN), including gastroparesis (early satiety, bloating, vomiting) and diabetic diarrhea (profuse, watery diarrhea). Autonomic neuropathy is a common complication in patients with long-standing, poorly controlled diabetes, such as this patient with a hemoglobin A1c of 13%. Diabetic diarrhea is the result of autonomic neuropathy of the GI tract, leading to abnormal motility. The best initial treatment is better glycemic control (A), as poorly controlled diabetes is the underlying cause of the neuropathy.  Elimination of dairy from the diet (B) might be a reasonable approach if the patient had a lactose intolerance, but there is no indication of this in the clinical scenario. Metoclopramide (C) improves gastric emptying and can be used to treat gastroparesis, but it does not have any effect on diarrhea. Rifaximin (D) and Vancomycin (E) are antibiotics which can be used to treat diarrhea caused by bacterial overgrowth or Clostridium difficile infections, respectively. However, there is no indication that this patient's diarrhea is due to a bacterial infection. Antibiotics were recently given to this patient, but the diarrhea has a duration of two months, so it is less likely to be a side effect of the antibiotics used for the ear infection.

The patient's hypertension and the description of a murmur after S2 over the left sternal border is consistent with aortic regurgitation (AR). AR is commonly caused by hypertension, aortic root dilation, and bicuspid aortic valve. It leads to increased stroke volume due to the addition of regurgitant blood to the normal volume of blood entering the left ventricle during diastole. This increased volume of blood leads to eccentric hypertrophy (volume overload) of the left ventricle. The murmur of AR is a diastolic, high-pitched, decrescendo murmur heard best at the left sternal border. Thus, another finding in this patient could be a murmur that radiates to the carotids (Choice C).  The other options described do not occur commonly with AR: - An audible click heard at the cardiac apex (Choice A) is associated with mitral valve prolapse. - A femoral artery murmur (Choice B) is associated with patent ductus arteriosus, which is unlikely in an adult patient. - A rumbling heard at the cardiac apex (Choice D) often describes a diastolic murmur caused by mitral stenosis. - Wedge pressure lower than expected (Choice E) would be unusual unless there is associated severe left-sided heart failure or another condition causing hypovolemia such as bleeding or dehydration. In AR, the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and consequently the wedge pressure may be high.

This patient's recurrent infections, congenital heart disease (VSD), and characteristic facial features (cleft palate, abnormal facial appearance) suggest a diagnosis of DiGeorge syndrome, which is a disorder caused by abnormal migration and development of certain cells and tissues during fetal development. DiGeorge syndrome is characterized by defects in the heart, parathyroid glands, and thymus and facial abnormalities. Therefore, the B-cell deficiency (Option B) is consistent with DiGeorge syndrome as it results in immune deficiency. Most of these patients have T-cell deficiency due to thymus hypoplasia, but B-cell function may also be affected.  Option A (Kidney stones) is incorrect as DiGeorge Syndrome does not typically present with kidney stones.   Option C (A positive Chvostek's sign) is associated with hypocalcemia, which can occur in DiGeorge syndrome due to parathyroid hypoplasia. However, this sign does not indicate a B-cell deficiency but rather a calcium imbalance.  Option D (A shortened QT Interval) is not directly associated with DiGeorge syndrome. In fact, some studies suggest that a prolonged QT interval may occur in some cases.  Option E (Hypoactive deep tendon reflexes) is not typically associated with DiGeorge syndrome. This finding may occur in conditions that affect the peripheral nerves or muscles, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome or hypothyroidism.

The correct answer is B: McBurney's point.  The clinical presentation of the patient is consistent with acute appendicitis, which commonly presents with periumbilical pain that migrates to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and fever. McBurney's point is the point that is one-third of the distance from the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus; this is the most common location of maximum tenderness in acute appendicitis. A surgical procedure, such as an appendectomy, is typically performed to prevent complications such as rupture and peritonitis.  Option A: Teniae coli are three separate longitudinal ribbons of smooth muscle on the outside of the ascending, transverse, descending and sigmoid colon. They are not typically used in the surgical identification of the appendix.  Option C: The transumbilical plane is a horizontal plane across the abdomen at the level of the umbilicus. While it may provide a general location for surgical orientation, it is not as specific as McBurney's point.  Option D: Linea semilunaris is a curved tendinous line on the lateral edge of the rectus abdominis muscle. It is not used to locate appendix in abdominal surgery.  Option E: The arcuate line is the border where the lower limit of the posterior rectus sheath is absent. It does not play a role in the identification of the appendix during surgery.

This patient's history of diabetes and presentation of confusion, lethargy, diaphoresis (sweating), and difficulty talking suggest hypoglycemia, which is likely due to her use of insulin. The "pill to calm her nerves" could be a benzodiazepine, which increases gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity and can cause sedation (Choice B). However, it wouldn't cause the other symptoms of hypoglycemia. Diaphoresis is a sympathetic response to low blood glucose. It is therefore incorrect to say that sympathetic nervous system dependent symptoms are being masked (Choice A). Anticholinergic side effects (Choice C) typically include dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, and blurred vision, which this patient doesn't have. Opioids, which stimulate the mu receptor (Choice D), cause miosis, respiratory depression, and decreased bowel sounds, which also aren't present in this patient. Although hyperosmolar nonketotic coma (Choice E) can occur in type 2 diabetes, it presents with severe dehydration, neurological impairment, and hyperglycemia.   So, the correct answer is Increased GABAergic activity(B). The confusion and lethargy seen in this patient are likely due to the "pill to calm her nerves," which is most likely a benzodiazepine. Benzodiazepines enhance GABA activity, a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, leading to the CNS depression seen in this patient. In contrast, symptoms of hypoglycemia (eg, diaphoresis) are not typically seen with benzodiazepines.

The correct answer is C, 'Positive anti-dsDNA antibodies'.   This patient's arthritis, renal disease (as evidenced by urinary WBCs), and mother's history of an autoimmune disorder with characteristic malar rash suggest a diagnosis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). The diagnosis of SLE is based on the American College of Rheumatology criteria, which includes at least 4 of 11 possible criteria. Renal disease and arthritis are two of these criteria, as are the presence of antinuclear antibodies or anti-dsDNA antibodies.   As for other options -   A - A hiking trip two months ago could hint towards Lyme disease, but symptoms of Lyme disease typically include a bull's eye rash, fever, headache, and fatigue. There's no mention of these in the patient's history.  B - Recent norovirus gastroenteritis might cause renal disease due to dehydration, but there's no gastrointestinal symptoms mentioned.  D - Chondrocalcinosis of the left knee refers to calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate crystal deposition disease (CPPD). This patient's symptoms don't fit with CPPD.  E - HLA-B27 positive genotype is associated with spondyloarthropathies such as ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis. But these diseases usually present with lower back pain, not knee pain, and don't typically involve the kidneys.

The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is 'A': Adenosine.   This patient's presentation of a regular, narrow complex tachycardia that did not terminate with carotid sinus massage is consistent with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). PSVT is a common arrhythmia that can occur in patients of any age. It is often precipitated by alcohol, caffeine, or stress. Initial treatment of PSVT is with vagal maneuvers (eg, carotid sinus massage, Valsalva maneuver). If these maneuvers are unsuccessful in terminating the PSVT, the next step in management is administration of adenosine. Adenosine is a short-acting, endogenous nucleoside that slows conduction time through the atrioventricular (AV) node and can interrupt reentry pathways. Adenosine is first-line therapy for stable PSVT due to its rapid onset of action (seconds) and short half-life (<10 seconds).   Option 'B': Amiodarone is a Class III antiarrhythmic often used in the management of ventricular and atrial tachyarrhythmias, but it is not first-line for PSVT.   Option 'C': Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside that increases contractility and slows AV nodal conduction, but again is not first-line therapy for PSVT.  Option 'D': Propranolol is a beta-blocker that may be used in the long-term management of PSVT to prevent recurrence, but it is not used in the acute setting.  Option 'E': Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, can also be used for rate control in atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, but it is not first-line for PSVT.

This patient's symptoms of bilateral lower extremity discomfort and erectile dysfunction, which are exacerbated by walking and relieved by rest, are suggestive of neurogenic claudication due to lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). LSS is a common cause of pain and disability in patients >60 years of age, but it can also occur in younger patients with significant risk factors (eg, chronic laborers, obesity). The stenosis can lead to compression of the cauda equina nerve roots and result in a variety of symptoms including lower extremity discomfort, weakness, and numbness as well as changes in bowel/bladder function and sexual dysfunction (eg, impotence). On physical examination of patients with LSS, neurologic signs such as hyperreflexia, clonus, and bilateral Babinski signs are generally absent. However, signs of nerve root impingement such as decreased anal tone may be noted. Hence, 'Decreased anal tone' (Option E) is the correct answer.  Decreased bilateral femoral pulses (Option A) would suggest peripheral artery disease, which can also cause claudication but would not explain his erectile dysfunction or other reported symptoms. Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (Option B) is a disorder of eye movement, often caused by multiple sclerosis or stroke, which does not fit his symptoms. Papular rash over the palms and soles (Option C) could suggest secondary syphilis, but his neurologic symptoms are not consistent with this diagnosis. Jugular venous distention (Option D) is often seen in heart failure, but this patient's symptoms are not suggestive of heart failure.

The correct answer is B. 'Ultrasound of the pelvis'  This patient's presentation of right lower quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis is suggestive of acute appendicitis, which is the most common abdominal surgical emergency. However, in female patients of reproductive age, the differential diagnosis is broader because gynecologic pathology (e.g., ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease [PID]) can present similarly. Given the overlapping signs and symptoms among these conditions, the next best step in management is to perform a pelvic ultrasound. This non-invasive imaging can assess for gynecologic pathology and help rule in or rule out acute appendicitis, especially if a secondary sign of appendicitis (eg, periappendiceal fluid, echogenic mesentery) is present.  In contrast, a pelvic exam (Choice A) can be done, but it will not rule out the possibility of appendicitis. Also, it is less helpful in diagnosing other potential causes of right lower quadrant pain like ovarian torsion or PID, which are better evaluated with ultrasound.   Ultrasound of the appendix (Choice C) will not help in diagnosing gynecologic conditions. Although ultrasound can be used to diagnose appendicitis, it is not as sensitive as CT scan.   An upper gastrointestinal series or endoscopy (Choices D and E) would not be appropriate given that her symptoms are suggestive of a lower abdominal process. These procedures are typically reserved for evaluation of upper GI symptoms (e.g., dysphagia, upper abdominal pain).   The patientâs presentation is not suggestive of an upper gastrointestinal pathology, making these choices incorrect.

The correct answer is C: Binding of virus-specific immunoglobulins to free virus.  Explanation: During an influenza infection, the immune system combats the virus through both the innate and adaptive immune responses. However, during the first exposure to the influenza virus, it is the adaptive immune response, and more specifically the humoral immunity that plays a crucial role. B cells produce specific antibodies (immunoglobulins) that bind to the free viruses and neutralize them. This not only prevents the virus from infecting the cells but also marks them for destruction by cells of the immune system.  Why the other options are wrong:  A: Natural killer cell-induced lysis of virus-infected cells does occur but is part of the innate immune response and is not as specific as the adaptive immune response. During the first exposure to a virus, the main response is from the adaptive immune system.  B: Presentation of viral peptides on MHC class I is a part of the cellular immune response and involves CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, not CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cells recognize antigens presented on MHC class II molecules.  D: Complement-mediated lysis of virus-infected cells does occur but is not the primary mechanism during a first time infection. The complement system is part of the innate immune response and is not as specific as the adaptive immune response.  E: Eosinophil-mediated lysis of virus-infected cells is incorrect because eosinophils are typically associated with parasitic infections and allergic reactions, not viral infection.

The correct answer is A: Usually idiopathic in nature.   The patient's presentation and lab findings are consistent with medullary sponge kidney (MSK), a condition that is typically idiopathic in nature. MSK is characterized by cystic dilatations of the distal collecting ducts (usually precalyceal) within one or both renal pyramids. It is typically bilateral and can result in nephrolithiasis due to urinary stasis, which can lead to recurrent episodes of renal colic, as seen in this patient. Hematuria and urinary tract infections can also occur. Imaging often reveals nephrocalcinosis (calcium deposits within the renal parenchyma), as suggested by the "dense echogenic foci" on this patient's ultrasound.   The remaining answer choices are incorrect:  Option B: Acquired condition secondary to dialysis: Dialysis can lead to a number of renal changes, but it is not associated with the development of MSK.  Option C: Developmental anomaly characterized by cystic dilatation of the collecting tubules in the renal pyramids: While MSK does involve cystic dilatations in the renal pyramids, it is not considered a developmental anomaly.  Option D: Neoplastic changes in the proximal tubular cells of the kidneys: Neoplastic changes would likely present with different symptoms and lab findings. They are also not associated with MSK.  Option E: Vascular anomalies and genetic mutations leading to maldevelopment of the kidneys: While some cases of MSK have been associated with genetic mutations, the majority of cases are idiopathic in nature. Vascular anomalies are not typically associated with MSK.

This patient's symptoms of new-onset language impairment with relative sparing of repetition is consistent with a diagnosis of Broca's aphasia. Broca's aphasia is characterized by non-fluent, effortful speech output with intact comprehension. Patients with Broca's aphasia are often aware of their speech difficulties, resulting in significant frustration. The lesion responsible for Broca's aphasia is typically in the posterior portion of the frontal lobe, specifically in the inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant cerebral hemisphere (which is the left hemisphere in about 95% of right-handed individuals and 70% of left-handed individuals). This area is supplied by the superior division of the middle cerebral artery (Option E).   Option A and C are incorrect because they describe watershed (border zone) areas, which are vulnerable during systemic hypoperfusion (e.g., shock, severe hypotension). The clinical presentation would usually involve higher cognitive functions like problem-solving, and changes in personality rather than isolated speech problems.   Option B and D are incorrect because infarctions in these vascular distributions would lead to different clinical presentations. The inferior division of the middle cerebral artery (Option B) supplies Wernicke's area, and damage to this area leads to Wernicke's aphasia characterized by fluent, nonsensical speech with poor comprehension. Proximal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (Option D) would result in a combination of motor, sensory, and cortical signs including contralateral hemiparesis and hemisensory loss, homonymous hemianopia, and possibly aphasia (if the left hemisphere is affected).

The correct answer is A: Gallstones. The medication that her physician is considering starting is a bile acid sequestrant, such as cholestyramine, colestipol, or colesevelam. These drugs work by binding bile acids in the gut, thereby preventing their reabsorption and effectively forcing the liver to use more cholesterol to produce new bile acids. This can lead to a reduction in cholesterol levels. However, a potential adverse effect of these medications is the formation of gallstones. This is because bile, which is normally stored in the gallbladder, is made up of water, fats, and bile salts. By forcing the liver to use more cholesterol to produce bile salts, the balance of these components can be disrupted, leading to an increase in the concentration of cholesterol in the bile, thus setting the stage for gallstone formation.  Option B (Pruritis) is usually associated with bile flow blockage, not bile acid sequestrants. Option C (Acanthosis nigricans) is typically associated with insulin resistance. Option D (Facial flushing) is a common side-effect of niacin, another cholesterol-lowering medication. Option E (Fat malabsorption) can occur with other cholesterol-lowering drugs like Orlistat, which inhibits pancreatic lipase and thus fat digestion. It can also occur with bile acid sequestrants, but it is less common than gallstones.

This patient has diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is characterized by hyperglycemia (blood glucose >250 mg/dL), ketosis, and metabolic acidosis (bicarbonate <15 mEq/L). DKA is most commonly triggered by infections, reduced insulin compliance, first presentation of type I diabetes, or increased insulin requirement from stress or pregnancy.  Initial treatment of DKA involves simultaneous administration of insulin and intravenous fluids. Insulin helps to suppress hepatic glucose production and lipolysis and also promotes glucose utilization in peripheral tissues. Fluids are essential to correct the severe volume depletion seen in DKA.   Hypokalemia, as seen in this patient (K+ 2.9 mEq/L), is common during treatment as insulin drives potassium into cells. As such, if serum potassium is <3.3 mEq/L or the patient is about to receive insulin, potassium replacement should be initiated to prevent life-threatening hypokalemia.   Therefore, the best initial step in management for this patient is Option D - Normal saline, insulin, and potassium.   Option A is incorrect as it does not include the necessary fluid resuscitation.  Option B is incorrect because it does not address the patient's hypokalemia. Option C is incorrect because it does not include insulin, which is necessary to reduce blood glucose levels and suppress ketone production. Option E is incorrect because sodium bicarbonate is not typically used in the treatment of DKA unless the pH is <6.9. In this case, the bicarbonate level is low, but the actual arterial blood pH is not given.

This patient's history of bloody diarrhea followed by ascending paralysis with sensory abnormalities is suggestive of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). GBS is often preceded by a gastrointestinal or respiratory infection and is thought to be an immune-mediated attack on peripheral nerves. Motor symptoms usually begin in the lower extremities and ascend over hours to days, and may even affect respiratory muscles, leading to potentially life-threatening respiratory failure. Deep tendon reflexes are typically decreased or absent.  The best initial step in managing this patient is to assess her respiratory function, and the most direct method for doing this is spirometry (Choice E). Specifically, forced vital capacity (FVC) and negative inspiratory force (NIF) are two easy bedside tests that can be used to assess the strength of the respiratory muscles. An FVC <20 mL/kg or an NIF <25 cm H2O suggests impending respiratory failure and is an indication for intubation.  Intubation (Choice B) would be the correct answer if the patient showed signs of respiratory distress or had poor spirometry results. However, the patient's respiratory status is not in immediate danger with an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air and a respiratory rate of 29/min.   Dexamethasone (Choice A) is a glucocorticoid which is not effective for GBS and is not recommended.   IV immunoglobulin (Choice C) and plasmapheresis are both equally effective treatment options for GBS, but are not the first step in management.   Pyridostigmine (Choice D) is used to treat myasthenia gravis, another disorder of the neuromuscular junction, but is not effective for GBS.

Tadalafil is a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor. The drug works by preventing the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) by phosphodiesterase 5 in the smooth muscle cells lining the blood vessels supplying the lungs. The increase in cGMP results in vasodilation by relaxing of smooth muscle cells. cGMP is a second messenger in the nitric oxide pathway, which is known for its role in vasodilation. Hence, the most likely mechanism of beneficial effect of tadalafil in this case is 'Increased activation of protein kinase A' (Option C), as cGMP activates protein kinase G, which then leads to activation of protein kinase A, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation.  Option 'A' is incorrect as blockade of endothelin-1 binding at the endothelin receptor is the mechanism of action of drugs like bosentan, not tadalafil. Endothelin-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor.  Option 'B' is incorrect as tadalafil does not have any significant effect on the sensitivity of smooth muscles to norepinephrine.   Option 'D' is incorrect as reduction of transmembrane calcium current is not the primary mechanism of action of tadalafil. This is more characteristic of calcium channel blockers.  Option 'E' is incorrect as tadalafil does not directly enhance the activity of nitric oxide. Rather, it works downstream of nitric oxide by preventing the breakdown of cGMP, a molecule that is produced in response to nitric oxide.

The correct answer is 'D': 'Presence of cytokines'.   Cytokines are protein molecules that are released by immune cells and play a crucial role in cell signaling during immune responses. Certain cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukins, can stimulate the inflammatory response in vascular endothelial cells, which may trigger plaque rupture leading to myocardial infarction. Therefore, the presence of cytokines may indicate an ongoing inflammatory process that can predict myocardial necrosis.  Option 'A': 'Cholesterol crystal presence' is incorrect because cholesterol crystals are a part of atheromatous plaques that contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease, but their presence does not necessarily predict myocardial necrosis.  Option 'B': 'Rate of plaque formation' is incorrect as it is more related to the progression of atherosclerosis rather than acute plaque rupture that leads to myocardial necrosis.  Option 'C': 'Calcium content' is incorrect because although calcium can be a component of atheromatous plaques, it is not a direct predictor of myocardial necrosis.   Option 'E': 'Amount of foam cells' is incorrect because foam cells are indicative of atherosclerosis, not of the imminent risk of myocardial necrosis. Foam cells are formed when macrophages consume low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and become laden with lipid (fat), but the amount of foam cells does not necessarily correlate with the risk of myocardial infarction or necrosis. 

The correct answer is 'D': Spinach.   The patient in the vignette is on warfarin for stroke prevention. Warfarin is an anticoagulant that works by inhibiting vitamin K-dependent clotting factors in the liver. Thus, dietary changes that increase vitamin K intake can interfere with the effectiveness of warfarin, leading to a decreased anticoagulant effect and an increased risk for thromboembolic events. Green leafy vegetables such as spinach are high in vitamin K and if consumed in large amounts, can potentially counteract the effects of warfarin. This could have led to the intracranial bleed seen in this patient.  Now let's discuss why the other options are incorrect:  'A': St. Johns wort: This is a plant that's often used as a dietary supplement for depression. It can reduce the effectiveness of many drugs, including warfarin, by inducing cytochrome P450 enzymes. However, this would likely result in increased thrombosis rather than bleeding.  'B': Chili peppers: These don't significantly interact with warfarin.  'C': Grapefruit juice: This can actually increase the effectiveness of warfarin by inhibiting cytochrome P450 enzymes, thereby increasing risk of bleeding. However, the vignette doesn't suggest that the patient is over-anticoagulated (which could cause an intracranial bleed), but rather under-anticoagulated due to vitamin K intake.  'E': Green tea: This contains vitamin K and could also theoretically decrease the effectiveness of warfarin, but it contains much less vitamin K than spinach.

The patient's acute onset of abdominal pain, along with peritoneal signs (rebound tenderness) on examination, is suggestive of a perforated viscus, most likely the peptic ulcer. The most common complication of peptic ulcer disease is bleeding, but perforation may also occur. These patients typically present with sudden onset of severe, generalized abdominal pain. Examination may reveal a rigid, quiet abdomen with rebound tenderness due to the presence of free air and fluid from the gastrointestinal tract in the peritoneum (peritonitis). The best initial diagnostic test in this setting would be upright or left lateral decubitus abdominal radiographs, which can demonstrate free intraperitoneal air under the diaphragm (Option A).  Option B: Urgent CT abdomen and pelvis would be used if the diagnosis was not clear on radiographs, but it is not the first line imaging. Option C: Upper endoscopy is used for direct visualization of the mucosal surface of the upper gastrointestinal tract, it is not preferred in acute abdomen due to risk of perforating an already perforated viscus. Option D: H. pylori testing would be relevant for a patient with peptic ulcer disease, but it would not help in the acute management of this patient. Option E: Serum gastrin level could be checked if there was suspicion for Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, a rare condition which causes recurrent ulcers, but it is not relevant in this acute setting.

The most appropriate next step in management is A: Ethics committee consultation.  The patient's lack of cough response during suctioning, absence of corneal, gag, and oculovestibular reflexes, and positive apnea test suggest brain death. Brain death is the irreversible cessation of all cerebral and brain stem function.  Management of patients with suspected brain death includes completing a full clinical evaluation and any appropriate confirmatory tests, documenting the cause of brain death, and consulting with an ethics committee or legal counsel if necessary. Consultation with an ethics committee is important in cases like this where the patient does not have a known family or advance directive to make medical decisions on his behalf.  Option B, Cerebral angiography, is not necessary in this case because the patient has clear clinical signs of brain death.   Option C, Court order for further management, is not typically the first step in managing suspected brain death. While legal counsel might be necessary in some cases, the first step is usually consultation with an ethics committee.  Option D, Remove the ventilator, is not appropriate because decisions about discontinuing life-sustaining treatment should be made with the involvement of an ethics committee and, if possible, the patientâs family or surrogate decision-maker.   Option E, Repeat CT scan of the head, is not necessary because the patient has clear clinical signs of brain death, and the cause of the brain death (ie, left intracerebral hemorrhage with mass effect) has already been documented.

The symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea alongside findings of bilateral basilar crackles suggest a diagnosis of congestive heart failure. This could be due to aortic valve stenosis (option E), a condition that can lead to left ventricular outflow obstruction, resulting in increased pressure and hypertrophy in the left ventricle. This can subsequently cause left-sided heart failure. The history of intravenous drug use could have potentially caused infective endocarditis, which can lead to valvular damage and stenosis over time. Additionally, as the patient has never smoked, it is less likely that the symptoms are due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other lung-related conditions.  Option A, mitral valve regurgitation, can cause similar symptoms to aortic stenosis, but would typically be accompanied by a holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex and radiating to the axilla. Option B, tricuspid valve regurgitation, typically presents with right heart failure symptoms such as peripheral edema and jugular venous distension. Option C, aortic valve regurgitation, usually presents with a diastolic decrescendo murmur heard best at the left sternal border, and can lead to a wide pulse pressure, which is not mentioned in this case. Option D, mitral valve stenosis, typically presents with a diastolic rumble heard best at the apex in the left lateral decubitus position, and is frequently associated with a history of rheumatic fever, which is not present in this case.

The most likely causal organism in this case is Klebsiella granulomatis (Option B). The patient's symptoms and history are consistent with granuloma inguinale (also known as donovanosis), a sexually transmitted disease caused by Klebsiella granulomatis. Granuloma inguinale is characterized by painless, progressive ulcerative lesions without regional lymphadenopathy. The lesions are typically beefy red and bleed easily. The disease is predominantly found in tropical and subtropical areas such as India and Papua New Guinea.   The other options are less likely:  Option A: Chlamydia trachomatis is usually associated with a painless genital ulcer and lymphadenopathy, characteristic of lymphogranuloma venereum.   Option C: Treponema pallidum is the causative organism of syphilis, which typically presents with a painless ulcer (chancre) and regional lymphadenopathy. The ulcer and lymphadenopathy of syphilis are usually painless, which is not consistent with this patient's presentation.  Option D: Herpes simplex virus 2 could cause painful genital ulcers, but associated systemic symptoms such as fever and malaise would typically be present, and the ulcers would be smaller and more vesicular in nature.   Option E: Haemophilus ducreyi causes chancroid, a sexually transmitted infection characterized by painful genital ulcers and painful inguinal lymphadenopathy. However, the ulcers of chancroid are typically described as having a "dirty gray" or "yellowish gray" color and the ulcer base would not be necrotic.

The patient's clinical history, physical examination, and biopsy findings are consistent with Burkitt lymphoma, a highly aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is endemic to certain parts of Africa. Burkitt lymphoma is associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which is a DNA virus. In this cancer, the mechanism underlying the malignant transformation is the "Integration of viral DNA" (Option E) into the host genome. This integration can lead to the activation of cellular proto-oncogenes, such as c-myc, which is a transcription factor that promotes cell growth and proliferation. When it is dysregulated, it can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and malignancy.  Although Options A ('Activation of transcription') and D ('Inhibition of cell cycle arrest') can be associated with the pathogenesis of various malignancies, they are not specific to EBV-induced Burkitt lymphoma. Option B ('Defect in DNA repair') is often associated with inherited cancer syndromes (eg, BRCA1 mutation in breast and ovarian cancer, mismatch repair genes in Lynch syndrome). Option C ('Impairment of receptor function') is often seen in hormone receptor-related cancers (eg, estrogen receptor in breast cancer, androgen receptor in prostate cancer). However, these options are not directly related to the pathogenesis of Burkitt lymphoma.

The most likely diagnosis is D: Dopamine blockade in the tuberoinfundibular pathway. This patient's symptoms of galactorrhea (nipple discharge), fatigue, decreased libido, and recent weight gain suggest a prolactin-secreting pituitary mass or hyperprolactinemia. The pituitary gland is responsible for producing prolactin, which stimulates breastmilk production. Prolactin secretion is typically inhibited by dopamine, which is produced in the hypothalamus and transmitted to the pituitary gland along the tuberoinfundibular pathway. Antipsychotic medications, which are commonly used to treat schizophrenia, block dopamine receptors, thereby decreasing the inhibitory effect on prolactin and leading to an increase in prolactin levels. This process can manifest as galactorrhea, decreased libido, and menstrual irregularities.  The other options are wrong because:  A: Viral infection of the thyroid gland could cause thyroiditis, with symptoms like pain, fever, and hyper- or hypothyroid symptoms, which are not present in this case.  B: Autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland refers to Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which would present with hypothyroid symptoms like cold intolerance, weight gain, and constipation. However, it would not cause galactorrhea.  C: Protein-secreting CNS mass could cause a variety of symptoms depending on the location of the mass and the specific protein being overproduced, but this is less likely than option D given the patient's history of schizophrenia and the specific symptom constellation.  E: Normal pregnancy can cause galactorrhea due to the physiologic increase in prolactin. However, the patient does not report any symptoms of pregnancy and her other symptoms are not typical for pregnancy.

This patient's history of progressive hearing loss, multiple fractures, tall stature, and lankiness is suggestive of Marfan syndrome. Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, which codes for the protein fibrillin-1. Fibrillin is a glycoprotein that is essential for the formation of elastic fibers found in connective tissue. Defect in fibrillin-1 results in the formation of faulty connective tissue, leading to the multisystem abnormalities seen in Marfan syndrome. This includes skeletal abnormalities (such as long limbs, tall stature, joint hypermobility), ocular abnormalities (such as ectopia lentis), cardiovascular abnormalities (such as aortic dissection, aortic regurgitation), and auditory abnormalities (such as sensorineural hearing loss).  Option B: Mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor can result in skeletal disorders like achondroplasia, not Marfan syndrome. Option C: Mutations in the Type 1 collagen gene are associated with disorders such as osteogenesis imperfecta, not Marfan syndrome. Option D: Mutations in the Type 3 collagen gene are associated with disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, not Marfan syndrome. Option E: Mutations in the Type 4 collagen gene, which is found in the basement membrane, are associated with Alport syndrome, a hereditary nephritis associated with sensorineural hearing loss and ocular abnormalities, not Marfan syndrome.   Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: Fibrillin.

The correct answer is A: Auer rods on peripheral smear.   This patient's symptoms of fever, fatigue, weight loss, and a new-onset left upper quadrant mass (presumably the spleen) are concerning for leukemia, a common childhood malignancy. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one such type and is characterized by the presence of Auer rods on peripheral blood smear. Auer rods are crystal-like inclusions seen within the cytoplasm of myeloblasts and are considered pathognomonic for AML.   Option B: Infection sensitive to oseltamivir, is incorrect because oseltamivir is an antiviral medication used to treat influenza. This patient's symptoms are not characteristic of influenza, which typically presents with acute onset of fever, cough, and aches.  Option C: Parental mistreatment of the child, would not be consistent with the clinical findings of fever, weight loss, and a left upper quadrant mass, but rather signs of physical or emotional abuse.  Option D: Smudge cells on peripheral smear, are seen in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a disease more common in elderly patients. Moreover, CLL typically presents with lymphadenopathy, not a left upper quadrant mass.  Option E: TdT positive cells, are typically seen in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). While ALL is the most common cancer in children and could present with similar symptoms, the left upper quadrant mass (likely an enlarged spleen) is more commonly seen in AML rather than ALL.

The correct answer is D. Wrinkled forehead.   The patient's symptoms of acute onset facial droop involving the entire half of the face, with preserved sensation, are suggestive of a peripheral lesion of the facial nerve (Bell's palsy), rather than a stroke. Stroke typically results in facial weakness sparing the forehead due to bilateral upper motor neuron innervation to the forehead muscles. This is contrasted with a Bell's palsy where there is a lower motor neuron lesion of the facial nerve, resulting in complete paralysis of all muscles on one side of the face, including the forehead. Hence, a wrinkled forehead (option D) on the unaffected side would be expected.   Option A is incorrect as Bell's palsy may actually cause increased tearing and salivation due to faulty reinnervation.  Option B is incorrect as while Bell's palsy can affect the nerve to stapedius (a small muscle in the ear) which can alter sound conduction and cause hyperacusis (increased sensitivity to sound), it doesn't cause partial hearing loss.  Option C is incorrect as the anterior two-thirds of the tongue is supplied by the facial nerve for taste. A complete loss of taste would require involvement of the glossopharyngeal nerve (posterior third of tongue) and the vagus nerve (very back of tongue) as well, which is not the case here.  Option E is incorrect as expressive aphasia (Broca's aphasia) is related to a lesion in the frontal lobe, typically associated with a stroke, and not related to the facial nerve which is involved in Bell's palsy.

This patient's recurrent sinus and ear infections along with decreased levels of IgG and IgA suggest a diagnosis of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) (option B). CVID is characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia, which leads to an increased susceptibility to bacterial infections, especially encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The decreased levels of IgA can lead to sinus and respiratory tract infections, while decreased levels of IgG can lead to recurrent otitis media, pneumonia, and gastrointestinal infections.   Bruton agammaglobulinemia (option A) is not likely because it is a sex-linked disorder that primarily affects boys and involves a complete lack of all immunoglobulins, which is not seen here.   Hyper-IgM syndrome (option C) is characterized by normal or increased levels of IgM, but decreased levels of IgG, IgA, and IgE due to a defect in the CD40 ligand on T cells. This leads to an inability to class switch. The IgM levels in this patient are normal, so this diagnosis is less likely.   Selective IgA deficiency (option D) involves a decrease in only IgA, not IgG.  Severe combined immunodeficiency (option E), or SCID, is characterized by a profound deficiency in both B and T cell immunity and usually presents much earlier in life with severe infections.

The patient's symptoms and imaging studies are suggestive of a hepatic adenoma, which is associated with oral contraceptive pill use (Choice E). Hepatic adenomas are benign liver tumors that commonly occur in women of childbearing age and are associated with oral contraceptive use. They are typically solitary lesions that appear as well-demarcated, heterogeneous masses on imaging. The use of oral contraceptives increases the risk of hepatic adenoma due to the estrogenic effect on hepatocytes.   Chronic alcohol abuse (Choice A) is a risk factor for alcoholic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma, not hepatic adenomas.   Extrahepatic malignancy (Choice B) can metastasize to the liver, but this usually results in multiple lesions rather than a solitary mass.  Recent contact with dogs (Choice C) and recent travel to Mexico (Choice D) can be associated with hydatid disease (Echinococcus granulosus infection), which can cause liver cysts. However, this would be expected to present with a cystic lesion, not a solid one as seen in this patient.   So, the correct answer is oral contraceptive pill use (Choice E). This patient's long-term oral contraceptive use, the finding of a solitary mass on imaging, and the patient's age and sex all make hepatic adenoma a likely diagnosis.

The correct answer is 'B: Red granulation tissue.'  This patient's presentation of prolonged chest pain unresponsive to nitroglycerin, ST-segment elevations, and subsequent reperfusion is indicative of a myocardial infarction (MI). After an MI, the necrotic myocardium undergoes a predictable sequence of histologic changes.  - Within the first 24 hours, coagulation necrosis begins and neutrophils start to infiltrate the necrotic tissue (thus, choice A is incorrect because it occurs too early). - By 3-14 days post-MI, macrophages have removed most of the necrotic tissue. Granulation tissue, which appears red and granular, is present at the margins of the infarct. It consists of fibroblasts, blood vessels (capillaries), and connective tissue. Hence, this is what we would expect to see at around 3 weeks. - After 2 weeks, granulation tissue begins to be replaced by collagen deposited by fibroblasts, leading to a mature, white, fibrous scar that takes about 6-8 weeks to fully form (choice C is incorrect because it occurs too late). - Choice D (Pale infarcted tissue) is incorrect, because this is a description of what the tissue looks like immediately after the infarction, before the inflammatory process has begun. - Choice E (Yellow necrotic area) is incorrect, because this describes the color of an area of liquefactive necrosis, which is not a part of the healing process after an MI. Yellow necrotic areas are typically seen in abscesses, not in myocardial infarctions.

This patient's presentation of chronic symptoms (eg, fatigue, erectile dysfunction), acute abdominal pain after alcohol use, and laboratory evidence of hemolysis, combined with pancytopenia and a reticulocyte count lower than expected for the degree of anemia, is suggestive of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). PNH is an acquired stem cell disorder causing hemolytic anemia, bone marrow failure (ie, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia), and a hypercoagulable state. It is characterized by somatic mutation of the PIGA gene in a hematopoietic stem cell, resulting in defective production of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. As a result, GPI-anchored proteins (CD55 and CD59) are deficient on blood cells, leading to complement-mediated lysis. PNH can manifest with hemolytic anemia, cytopenias, and thrombosis. Thrombotic events occur in 30%-50% of patients and are the most common cause of death. Thrombosis commonly affects hepatic veins (Budd-Chiari syndrome), but also occurs in abdominal veins and cerebral veins (Option C).  Infection (Option A) and hemorrhage (Option B) are possible causes of mortality in PNH due to bone marrow failure, but thrombotic events are more common. High-output cardiac failure (Option D) is a potential outcome in severe chronic hemolytic anemia. Although hemolysis may be evident (eg, low haptoglobin, elevated LDH, indirect bilirubinemia), the anemia is typically moderate and does not usually result in high-output cardiac failure. Budd-Chiari syndrome (Option E) is a potential complication of PNH, but cerebral vein thrombosis is more common.

This patient's history of a previous spontaneous abortion at 22 weeks and preterm delivery at 24 weeks puts her at high risk for another preterm birth. Preterm birth occurs in ~12% of all pregnancies and is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Risk factors for preterm birth include prior preterm birth, multiple gestations, uterine/cervical abnormalities, and certain infections (eg, bacterial vaginosis). A short cervical length (<25 mm) on transvaginal ultrasound before 24 weeks of gestation is a powerful predictor of spontaneous preterm birth. The use of progesterone in patients with a history of spontaneous preterm birth (singletons) and/or a short cervical length (singletons and multiples) has been shown to reduce the risk of preterm birth. Intramuscular progesterone (option C) is used in patients with a history of prior spontaneous preterm birth but a normal cervical length. Vaginal progesterone (option E) is used in patients with a short cervix (history of preterm birth is not required). Vaginal progesterone is as effective as cerclage (option A) in these patients and has fewer complications.  Option B (Cervical pessary) is not recommended as routine care in women with a short cervix because it has not been shown to reduce the risk of preterm birth.  Option D (Intravenous betamethasone) is a corticosteroid used to accelerate fetal lung maturity in women who are at risk for preterm birth within the next week but is not used for long-term prevention of preterm birth.  In conclusion, the most appropriate next step in management is vaginal progesterone (option E).

The most appropriate step in management is A. Administer ulipristal acetate.   Ulipristal acetate is a selective progesterone receptor modulator that is used as an emergency contraceptive within 120 hours (5 days) of unprotected sexual intercourse. It is more effective than levonorgestrel (another option for emergency contraception) and can be used up to 120 hours after intercourse.   Option B, Insert progestin-containing intra-uterine device, would not be appropriate as the patient does not wish for her parents to be informed of the visit and this procedure would likely require parental consent, given the patient's age.  Option C, Administer mifepristone, is used for medical abortions rather than as a preventative measure.   Option D, Administer combined oral contraceptive, would not be effective as emergency contraception. Regular oral contraceptives work by preventing ovulation, but if ovulation has already occurred, they would not prevent pregnancy.   Option E, Insert copper-containing intra-uterine device, would also not be appropriate for similar reasons to option B. It requires an invasive procedure and also may need parental consent given the patient's age. Additionally, while the copper IUD can be used as emergency contraception, it would not be the best option in this case as the patient does not wish to become pregnant until after college, and an IUD is a long-term contraception method.

This patient's hyperglycemia, ketonuria, and anion gap metabolic acidosis (Na+ - [Cl- + HCO3-] = 16 mEq/L) are suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is caused by absolute or relative insulin deficiency. Lack of insulin results in hyperglycemia, volume depletion due to osmotic diuresis, and a shift from carbohydrate to fat metabolism. This last mechanism results in the production of ketone bodies, which, along with lactic acid, contribute to a high anion gap metabolic acidosis.  Initial treatment for DKA includes insulin and aggressive fluid resuscitation with isotonic saline to restore intravascular volume and decrease counterregulatory hormones, which will decrease ketogenesis. Insulin will decrease serum glucose levels and suppress ketogenesis. Therefore, when glucose levels decrease to <250 mg/dL, 5% dextrose should be added to the maintenance fluid to allow continued insulin administration until ketogenesis has stopped, while avoiding hypoglycemia. Consequently, the most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous 5% dextrose and 1/2 isotonic saline (Option E). The administration of sodium bicarbonate is generally not recommended because it does not improve outcomes and can potentially cause harm (Option C). In addition, this patient's potassium level is currently normal, so there is no need to administer potassium chloride (Option D). Subcutaneous insulin glargine is a long-acting insulin that is used for maintenance therapy in stable diabetic patients (Option A). It is not used in the acute management of DKA as it does not have a rapid onset of action.

The patient's history of sore throat, fever, subcutaneous nodules, endocarditis (as evidenced by the new murmur), arthralgia, and elevated antistreptolysin O titer indicate a diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) secondary to group A streptococcal infection. ARF is an autoimmune response against the M protein of the Streptococcus bacterium, which cross-reacts with proteins in human tissues, especially the heart, joints, subcutaneous tissues, and central nervous system. The immune response can result in permanent heart valve damage, predominantly of the mitral valve but also of the aortic valve.  Patients with a history of ARF are at increased risk for recurrent episodes, which can cause or worsen rheumatic heart disease. To prevent recurrent ARF, patients are given continuous antibiotic prophylaxis against Streptococcus. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be continued until the patient is 21 years of age or for at least 5 years after the last episode, whichever is longer (option D). Therefore, the correct answer is intramuscular benzathine penicillin every 4 weeks until the age of 21.  Options A, C, and E suggest different durations of prophylaxis, which would be inappropriate given the patient's age and clinical history. Option B, low-dose prednisone therapy for a month, would not be the appropriate next step in management, as it would not prevent future episodes of ARF. Although corticosteroids may be used in severe cases of ARF with carditis and heart failure, there's no evidence of severe carditis in this patient. Therefore, the focus should be on prophylaxis to prevent recurrent ARF and rheumatic heart disease.

The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a primary metabolic acidosis (low bicarbonate level) with a compensatory respiratory alkalosis (low pCO2). The anion gap, calculated as [Na+] - ([Cl-] + [HCO3-]), is 23.5 mEq/L (reference range 8-12 mEq/L), indicating an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis. The most common causes of elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis are lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, renal failure, and toxin ingestion (eg, methanol, ethylene glycol, salicylates).   In this case, the patient has recently undergone major surgery, which is a state of high metabolic demand. Postoperative nausea and vomiting in a patient with insulin-dependent diabetes can lead to inadequate oral intake and poor glycemic control. The resulting insulin deficiency prompts lipolysis and generation of ketone bodies (Î²-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate), which are strong organic acids that increase the anion gap. The clinical picture is consistent with ketoacidosis (choice C) due to starvation and stress of surgery.   Uremia (choice A) can cause an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis due to retention of organic acids, but this is usually seen in chronic kidney disease with significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (eg, creatinine >4 mg/dL). Vomiting (choice B) typically causes a hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. Early (choice D) and late (choice E) dumping syndromes occur following gastric surgery and are characterized by postprandial flushing, tachycardia, and either diarrhea (early) or hypoglycemia (late); they would not cause an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis.

The correct answer is C. 'History of alcoholism.'  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver malignancy. HCC usually arises in a cirrhotic liver, and cirrhosis is the strongest risk factor for HCC. The most common causes of cirrhosis in the United States are chronic hepatitis C infection, alcoholism, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.  This patient's long-standing history of liver cirrhosis and moderate alcohol consumption (2-3 pints of beer weekly) is the most significant risk factor for the development of HCC in this case. Although the other listed factors can contribute to liver disease, they are not as strongly associated with HCC as alcohol ingestion.  Option A, hepatitis E, is usually a self-limiting disease and does not typically lead to chronic liver disease or HCC. Option D, history of blood transfusion, could potentially suggest an infection with hepatitis C or B virus, which are strong risk factors for HCC, but this is not specified in this case, and the risk is less than that of alcoholism. Option E, hemochromatosis, can indeed lead to cirrhosis and HCC, but the patient's symptoms and the finding of decreased iron stores do not support this diagnosis. Option B, shortness of breath, is a nonspecific symptom and does not directly cause HCC.

The patient's history of obesity, increased hunger, polyuria, and elevated urine glucose on urinalysis suggests poorly controlled diabetes. Polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia are classic symptoms of hyperglycemia. The urine glucose (+++) on urinalysis is concerning for diabetes mellitus. Diabetes is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease in the United States. In addition to hypertension, diabetes causes glomerulosclerosis, which can lead to albuminuria and a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate, as seen in this patient. The development of CKD in patients with diabetes usually occurs 10-20 years after the onset of diabetes. Thus, the next best test to assess possible diabetic nephropathy would be a renal biopsy (Option B).   Option A, Renal arteriography, is usually not the first line imaging in assessing CKD because it is invasive and carries risks such as contrast-induced nephropathy.  Option C, Urine protein electrophoresis, is useful in determining the cause of proteinuria when it is unclear, such as in suspected multiple myeloma or nephrotic syndrome. However, in this case, the cause of the proteinuria is likely diabetes.  Option D, Renal computed tomography, is not typically used to assess CKD. It is more useful for identifying anatomical abnormalities such as renal masses or stones.  Option E, No further renal tests are required, is incorrect because the patient's symptoms, urinalysis results, and decreased GFR suggest CKD, which needs further evaluation.

This patient's diarrhea, weight loss, and bloating suggest malabsorption. The presence of bilateral white spots on the conjunctiva (Bitot spots) indicates vitamin A deficiency, which would be consistent with fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption. The D-xylose test measures carbohydrate absorption and would be abnormal in mucosal diseases (eg, celiac disease) but normal in diseases of intraluminal digestion (eg, pancreatic insufficiency) or transit (eg, short gut).  Additionally, the anterior neck mass that does not move with swallowing suggests thyroiditis, which can be associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as celiac disease. Celiac disease is a gluten hypersensitivity that results in inflammation and villous atrophy in the small bowel, leading to malabsorption. Therefore, a gluten-free diet is the most appropriate answer (Choice A).  Option B (Pancreatic enzyme replacement) would be appropriate in pancreatic insufficiency, which is not indicated in this case.  Option C (Tetracycline therapy) would be used for bacterial overgrowth, which is also not indicated in this case.  Option D (Mesalamine therapy) would be used for inflammatory bowel disease, which is not suggested by the history or physical exam findings in this patient.  Option E (Lactose-free diet) would be used in lactose intolerance, which would not cause the vitamin A deficiency or malabsorption seen in this patient.

The answer is D. 'Chloride channels of epithelial cells in sweat glands'.  The patient's deletion of the 508th codon on a gene on chromosome 7 is consistent with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene, which is located on chromosome 7. The most common mutation is a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508, which disrupts protein folding and leads to degradation of the misfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. This results in fewer CFTR channels at the cell surface.   CFTR is an ATP-gated chloride channel that is expressed in the epithelial cells of various organs, including the lungs, pancreas, sweat glands, and intestines. In the sweat glands, CFTR normally reabsorbs chloride from the sweat duct, resulting in sweat that is low in sodium and chloride. However, in CF, defective CFTR channels lead to decreased reabsorption of chloride and consequently increased concentration of chloride (and sodium, which follows chloride passively) in the sweat. This phenomenon is the basis for the sweat chloride test, which is used to diagnose CF.  Option A is incorrect as bicarbonate channels of pancreatic ductal cells are affected but the result is decreased, not increased activity. Option B is incorrect as calcium channels of distal tubular cells are not directly affected in CF. Option C is incorrect as sodium channels of respiratory epithelial cells are also affected, but the result is a decrease in activity, not an increase. Option E is incorrect as ATP-sensitive potassium channels of pancreatic beta cells are not directly affected in CF.

The most likely cause for the patient's symptoms is a mutation in glycoprotein Ib (option B). This patient's prolonged bleeding time, normal platelet count, and physical exam findings of petechiae and purpura are suggestive of a platelet function defect. Glycoprotein Ib is a component of the platelet membrane that binds von Willebrand factor, allowing platelet adhesion to the subendothelium. A defect in this protein, as seen in Bernard-Soulier syndrome, reduces platelet adhesion and causes a bleeding diathesis.  Option A: Decreased levels of von Willebrand factor is associated with von Willebrand disease, which would typically present with a normal platelet count and bleeding time, and an abnormal PTT.  Option C: Mutation in glycoprotein IIb/IIIa is associated with Glanzmann thrombasthenia, which results in impaired platelet aggregation. It would typically present with a normal platelet count, prolonged bleeding time, and abnormal platelet aggregation studies.  Option D: Production of antiplatelet antibodies is associated with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), which would typically present with a low platelet count, not a normal platelet count as seen in this patient.  Option E: Production of antibodies against ADAMTS13 is associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), which would typically present with a pentad of symptoms (fever, thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal insufficiency, and neurological symptoms), not described in this patient.

This patient's history of painless vaginal spotting and ultrasound findings (anterior placenta 1.5 cm from the internal cervical os) are consistent with placenta previa. Placenta previa is a condition in which the placenta implants over or near the cervical os and can cause painless antepartum bleeding in the second half of pregnancy. It is a risk factor for maternal hemorrhage and requires delivery by cesarean section. Given this patient's history of prior cesarean sections, an additional concern is placenta accreta spectrum (PAS), a condition in which the placenta grows too deeply into the uterine wall. Prior cesarean section and placenta previa are two major risk factors for PAS. Although this patient has not had significant bleeding, it remains a possibility, especially during delivery.   Option A is the correct management strategy. In the setting of placenta previa after 20 weeks gestation, delivery should be planned via cesarean section at 36-37 weeks to avoid labor and its associated contractions, which could lead to severe bleeding.   Option B is incorrect because attempting vaginal delivery in the setting of placenta previa risks life-threatening hemorrhage.   Option C is incorrect because placenta previa and PAS are both risk factors for significant antepartum and postpartum bleeding.  Option D is incorrect because the decision for cesarean delivery is based on the location of the placenta and not on the fetal lung maturity.  Option E is incorrect because although cesarean hysterectomy may be necessary in severe cases of PAS (eg, placenta percreta), it is not the first-line management strategy.

The most likely finding in this patient would be 'E': Microcytic anemia.   Alcohol abuse is known to cause a variety of hematologic disorders due to nutritional deficiencies, liver damage, bone marrow suppression, increased bleeding tendencies, and altered red blood cell production. Microcytic anemia, rather than the normocytic anemia more commonly associated with alcoholism, might be seen in this patient due to concomitant iron deficiency from poor diet or gastrointestinal bleeding, or from the direct toxic effect of alcohol on the red blood cells.   Let's discuss why the other options are incorrect:  A: Constipation - Alcohol is more likely to cause diarrhea than constipation due to its effect of speeding up digestion by increasing peristalsis.  B: Decreased CNS NMDA activity - Chronic alcohol use actually results in increased CNS NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) activity, not decreased. This is part of the reason why withdrawal from alcohol can lead to seizures.  C: Dysdiadochokinesia - This term describes an impaired ability to perform rapid, alternating movements and is often seen in conditions that affect the cerebellum, like multiple sclerosis or stroke. While alcoholism can lead to cerebellar degeneration, this is less common than the other pathologies listed.  D: Increased transketolase activity - This is not associated with alcohol abuse. Transketolase is an enzyme involved in the pentose phosphate pathway. Decreased activity (not increased) can be seen in thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency, which can occur in alcoholics due to malnutrition. However, this is less common and less specific than microcytic anemia.

This patient's symptoms of palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, and fainting episodes associated with tachycardia on exam are suggestive of a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). SVTs are rapid heart rhythms originating from the atria or atrioventricular (AV) node. Symptoms can vary from palpitations and discomfort to dizziness, dyspnea, chest pain, or even syncope as seen in this patient. The first-line treatment for a stable patient with paroxysmal SVT is vagal maneuvers (eg, Valsalva, carotid sinus massage) and, if these are unsuccessful, the administration of adenosine. In this case, since adenosine is not listed in the choices, the next best option would be C'Flecainide'. Flecainide is a class IC antiarrhythmic that slows conduction through the His-Purkinje system and can be used in the acute treatment of SVT.  Calcium gluconate (choice A) is used in the treatment of hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia, not for SVT. Epinephrine (choice B) is used in cardiac arrest, anaphylaxis, and severe asthma exacerbations, but it would be inappropriate in this case as it would likely exacerbate the tachycardia. Magnesium sulfate (choice D) is used in the treatment of torsades de pointes and eclampsia; it would not be beneficial in this scenario. Procainamide (choice E) is a class IA antiarrhythmic used to treat ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation but is not typically first-line for SVT.

The correct answer is D, 0.9% NaCl.   This patient's presentation of seizures, altered mental status, and signs of dehydration (dry lips, decreased skin turgor) during a prolonged endurance exercise in a hot environment is suggestive of hyponatremia, specifically exertional hyponatremia. This condition is caused by excessive fluid intake (relative to solute intake) and the loss of sodium through sweat. The mainstay of treatment is the administration of isotonic fluids (0.9% NaCl), which can correct hyponatremia and volume depletion.  Option A, Indapamide, and E, Furosemide, are diuretics. They would worsen the volume depletion and hyponatremia in this patient by causing more fluid and sodium loss.  Option B, Relcovaptan, is a vasopressin receptor antagonist used in the treatment of hyponatremia caused by syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion. However, this patient's hyponatremia is due to excessive sweating and inadequate fluid and sodium intake, not SIADH.  Option C, 3% NaCl, is hypertonic saline. It is used for the urgent treatment of severe, symptomatic hyponatremia (seizures, coma) when the sodium level is <120 mmol/L. However, it should be used with caution due to the risk of overly rapid correction of sodium that can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome. In general, isotonic fluids (0.9% NaCl) are preferred initially until the severity of the hyponatremia can be determined.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is D: Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). PSGN typically presents 1 to 3 weeks after a group A Streptococcus infection of the throat or skin. The patient's history of recent fever and sore throat, followed by flank pain, myalgia, and hematuria, is highly suggestive of PSGN.  A: Allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN) typically presents with fever, rash, and eosinophilia, often in patients with recent exposure to medications like antibiotics. However, the presence of RBCs in the urine is more typical of glomerular disease rather than AIN.   B: Pyelonephritis typically presents with fever, flank pain, and urinary symptoms such as urgency, frequency, and dysuria. The absence of urinary symptoms, bacteria in the urine, and costovertebral angle tenderness makes this diagnosis less likely.  C: Crystal-induced acute kidney injury is usually caused by drugs that are poorly soluble or by high serum concentrations of uric acid or calcium. The patient's history and presentation are not consistent with this diagnosis.  E: Thin basement membrane disease is a cause of persistent microscopic hematuria, typically presenting in adolescents or young adults. It is usually asymptomatic and does not cause acute kidney injury, so it is less likely in this case.

The correct answer is 'B: Type II pneumocytes'.   This patient's hypoxemia unresponsive to O2 therapy, need for mechanical ventilation, and new onset of late inspiratory crackles are suggestive of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is characterized by severe inflammation and increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary barrier, leading to protein-rich fluid leakage into the alveoli, impairment of gas exchange, and the need for mechanical ventilation. The initial insult in ARDS damages the Type I pneumocytes (therefore option A is incorrect) which cover a majority of the alveolar surface and are responsible for gas exchange.   Type II pneumocytes, while less abundant, are not as affected in ARDS and proliferate during lung injury, eventually differentiating into Type I cells to replace the damaged ones. These cells produce surfactant and contribute to reducing surface tension at the air-liquid interface in the alveoli, helping prevent alveolar collapse.  A chest X-ray (option C) in ARDS typically shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates (so it's not normal). The alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient (option D), which is the difference between the alveolar and arterial partial pressures of O2, is typically elevated in ARDS due to impairments in gas exchange (so it's not normal). Left atrial pressure (option E) is often normal in ARDS, however, the presence of crackles in this case may suggest the development of ventilator-induced lung injury with subsequent increase in pulmonary capillary pressure and transudation of fluid (so possibly it's not normal).

The most appropriate next step for the physician is to 'B': 'Seek court order for medical treatment of the son'. The principle of autonomy allows competent adults to refuse medical treatment for any reason, even if the decision may lead to their death. However, this principle does not apply to minors. When a parent refuses life-saving treatment for a child due to religious beliefs, it is considered medical neglect. Courts typically side with medical professionals who are advocating for the child's life or health over the parents' religious beliefs. Thus, the physician should seek a court order to overrule the parents' decision and provide the necessary life-saving treatment.  Option 'A' is incorrect because it disrespects the father's autonomy to refuse blood transfusion for himself but it does not provide the life-saving treatment for the son.   Option 'C' is incorrect because it disrespects both the father's and mother's autonomy to refuse blood transfusion for themselves and for their son.  Option 'D' is incorrect because waiting for the mother may cause unnecessary and harmful delay in the treatment of the son, whose condition is critical and requires immediate attention.  Option 'E' is incorrect because it would be medically inappropriate and potentially fatal to proceed with surgery without transfusion given the son's severe condition.

The most likely causal organism in this case is 'A': Haemophilus ducreyi. This patient's presentation of a genital ulcer followed by painful inguinal lymphadenopathy is suggestive of chancroid, an infection caused by Haemophilus ducreyi. Chancroid is a sexually transmitted disease characterized by painful genital ulcers and suppurative inguinal lymphadenopathy caused by H. ducreyi. The primary lesion presents as a tender papule that rapidly becomes pustular and eventually ulcerates. The ulcer is usually painful, with ragged, undermined borders and a base that is covered with a purulent exudate. Inguinal lymphadenopathy develops in half of the patients, and these nodes may suppurate and form buboes.  'B': Yersinia pestis is the bacteria that causes plague, which does cause swollen and painful lymph nodes, but it does not cause genital ulcers.   'C': Herpes simplex virus 2 can cause painful genital ulcers, but the lymphadenopathy it causes is usually not suppurative.  'D': Klebsiella granulomatis is associated with granuloma inguinale, which causes painless genital ulcers and negligible lymphadenopathy.  'E': Chlamydia trachomatis causes a sexually transmitted disease known as lymphogranuloma venereum. This presents with a small, often unnoticed, painless genital lesion followed by painful lymphadenopathy. However, unlike chancroid, the lymph nodes are typically matted together and exhibit minimal suppuration.

This patient's presentation of acute chest pain, diaphoresis, and elevated serum troponin level suggests acute myocardial infarction (MI). Her sudden collapse with loss of consciousness and absent pulses indicates cardiac arrest. The unspecified cardiac rhythm likely indicates ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT), which are the most common initial rhythms in cardiac arrest, especially in the context of acute MI. VF/VT leads to the loss of effective cardiac output and abrupt loss of consciousness. Defibrillation (option B) is therefore the most appropriate next step in management.  In VF/VT, immediate defibrillation is the treatment of choice as it has the best chance to restore normal rhythm and pulse. Epinephrine (option D) is often used after defibrillation to maximize coronary and cerebral perfusion pressures during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but it should not delay defibrillation.  Coronary angiography (option C) would be considered only after the patient is hemodynamically stable and not in cardiac arrest since it is both diagnostic and therapeutic for acute MI but does not address the immediate life-threatening condition of cardiac arrest.  Intravenous glucagon therapy (option A) is used to reverse beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker overdose, which does not seem to be the case here.  Intravenous dextrose therapy (option E) might be considered if the patient was in a diabetic hypoglycemic crisis, but her symptoms and history are most consistent with an acute MI leading to VF/VT and cardiac arrest.

The most appropriate next step in management for this patient would be to 'C: Administer pneumococcal conjugate vaccination.'  This patient who is =65 years old and has never received a pneumococcal vaccination should receive both the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23). Pneumococcal disease, caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Older adults and those with certain medical conditions (eg, chronic heart, lung, or liver disease; diabetes mellitus; alcoholism; cerebrospinal fluid leaks; cochlear implants) are at increased risk. Therefore, pneumococcal vaccination is a critical component of preventive care in these patients.  As for the other options:  'A: Recommend colonoscopy' - guidelines recommend colonoscopies every 10 years starting at age 50 if the previous results were normal, which they were in this case.  'B: Discuss PSA assessment with patient' - Guidelines do not recommend routine PSA screening for prostate cancer, but rather shared decision-making based on the patient's values and preferences.  'D: Obtain CT urography' - This might be considered given the patient's family history of bladder cancer and his own history of smoking, but it is not the most appropriate next step.   'E: Obtain renal ultrasound' - This would not be indicated as the patient has no symptoms or signs to suggest a renal disorder at this time.

The correct answer is B: Causes venodilation and a decrease in preload.   The patient's presentation is consistent with acute decompensated heart failure, characterized by symptoms such as dyspnea, pulmonary crackles, and jugular venous distension. These findings are indicative of fluid overload. The treatment of choice in this setting is a loop diuretic like furosemide, which can relieve symptoms quickly by promoting diuresis. However, another class of drugs used to manage symptoms in acute decompensated heart failure is nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin is a venodilator that works primarily by decreasing preload, which reduces the volume of blood the heart has to pump, thereby reducing the workload of the heart and alleviating symptoms.  Option A: The primary goal of treatment in this patient is to alleviate symptoms of fluid overload, not respiratory depression.  Option C and D: The patient's acute decompensated heart failure is most likely secondary to his history of myocardial infarctions. Increasing cardiac contractility (as with inotropes like dobutamine) would increase oxygen demand and could potentially exacerbate myocardial ischemia.   Option E: Chronic use of loop diuretics can lead to nephrogenic adaptations that decrease their efficacy, but in the context of acute decompensated heart failure, the immediate benefits of diuresis and symptom relief outweigh these concerns. Chronic use of nitroglycerin does not lead to nephrogenic adaptations.

The last codon in the given mRNA sequence is UAA (read in the 5 to 3 direction), which is a stop codon and does not code for an amino acid. Thus, there is no tRNA anticodon for this codon. However, if the question is asking for the tRNA anticodon of the last amino acid codon, which is AUC, the anticodon would be GAU (read in the 3 to 5 direction). tRNA anticodons pair with mRNA codons following the base-pairing rules, but they are complementary and antiparallel to the mRNA codons. Therefore, the correct answer is 'C':  "3' GAU 5'".  The other options are wrong for the following reasons: 'A': "3' GCG 5'" - This anticodon would pair with the mRNA codon CGC, not AUC. 'B': "3' CGC 5'" - This anticodon would pair with the mRNA codon GCG, not AUC. 'D': "5' CGG 3'" - First, tRNA anticodons are usually represented in the 3' to 5' direction. Second, this anticodon would pair with the mRNA codon GCC, not AUC. 'E': "3' CGG 5'" - This anticodon would pair with the mRNA codon GCC, not AUC.

The correct answer is 'B': It is a rare congenital anomaly of the pancreas.   The patient in the scenario has been diagnosed with pancreas divisum, a congenital anomaly of the pancreas that occurs when the ventral and dorsal ducts fail to fuse during embryological development. This failure results in the majority of the pancreas being drained by the dorsal duct (the small duct) into the minor papilla, which is a relatively narrow channel. As a result, it can predispose to pancreatitis.   Option 'A' is incorrect because, while pancreas divisum is the most common congenital pancreatic anomaly, many patients with this condition are asymptomatic and do not present with abdominal symptoms in childhood.   Option 'C' is incorrect because surgical intervention may be required for patients with pancreas divisum who have recurrent pancreatitis; a minor papillotomy or surgical sphincteroplasty can help reduce the frequency of pancreatitis episodes by improving drainage.   Option 'D' is incorrect because while MRCP can visualize the pancreatic ducts and may suggest the diagnosis of pancreas divisum, it is not always able to visualize the minor papilla. ERCP, as performed in the patient in the scenario, is currently the gold standard for diagnosing pancreas divisum.  Option 'E' is incorrect because the "stack sign" is associated with chronic pancreatitis, not pancreas divisum. This sign seen on endoscopic ultrasonography refers to the appearance of multiple, stacked hyperechoic foci due to calcification within the pancreatic ducts.

The patient's symptoms of decreased sensory function in the first three fingers plus exacerbation with wrist flexion and tapping over the flexor retinaculum are characteristic of carpal tunnel syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist. Pregnancy is a recognized risk factor for carpal tunnel syndrome due to fluid accumulation in the tissues (ie, edema), which can compress the median nerve. Obese women are at higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome during pregnancy due to the additional fluid accumulation. First-line treatment includes splinting the wrist in a neutral position and providing local glucocorticoid injections if necessary. These interventions are effective and safe in pregnancy. Most women who develop carpal tunnel syndrome in pregnancy find that it resolves after delivery when the pregnancy-related edema subsides. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 'Pre-pregnancy obesity increases risk of developing this condition during pregnancy.'  Option A is incorrect because carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition in pregnant women, not an uncommon one. Option C is wrong because corticosteroid injections are not contraindicated in pregnant women for managing carpal tunnel syndrome. They are considered safe and effective. Option D is incorrect because carpal tunnel syndrome often resolves after pregnancy. Option E is incorrect because although splinting can help relieve symptoms, it doesn't necessarily improve the "reported outcome" or overall prognosis, as most cases resolve after pregnancy regardless.

The most appropriate next step in management is 'D': Monitor without intervention.  The woman described here is in the active phase of the first stage of labor (cervix >3 cm dilated with regular contractions). Despite satisfactory uterine contractions (â¥3 in 10 minutes), cervical dilation has not progressed over 1 hour, indicating arrest of active phase. This diagnosis requires at least 4 hours of adequate contractions or â¥6 hours of inadequate contractions with no cervical change. Once diagnosed, the first step in management is amniotomy, if not already done. If arrest of dilation persists 2 hours after amniotomy despite adequate contractions, then a diagnosis of failed induction is made and cesarean delivery should be performed. If contractions remain inadequate, augmentation with oxytocin is indicated.  Option 'A': Begin active pushing is incorrect because the woman is not fully dilated at 10 cm. Pushing before full dilation can lead to cervical edema and prolong labor.  Option 'B': Retry maternal repositioning is done typically when there are nonreassuring fetal heart tracings, which is not the case here.  Option 'C': Administer tocolytics is incorrect because tocolytics are used to inhibit preterm labor, not to manage arrest of dilation in active labor.  Option 'E': Emergent cesarean delivery is incorrect because cesarean delivery is indicated for failed induction (ie, no cervical change after at least 2 hours of adequate uterine contractions following amniotomy), which is not the case here.

The patient's symptoms suggest a diagnosis of Aromatic L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase (AADC) Deficiency, which would be option D - Dopamine decarboxylase, another name for the same enzyme. This is a rare inherited disorder characterized by the deficiency of AADC enzyme, which is required for the synthesis of neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin. Key findings include hypotonia, poor suckling, oculogyric crises, and symptoms of autonomic dysfunction including vomiting and temperature instability.  In the pathway of dopamine synthesis, phenylalanine is converted to tyrosine by phenylalanine hydroxylase. Then, tyrosine is converted to Levodopa (L-DOPA) by Tyrosine hydroxylase. Finally, L-Dopa is converted into dopamine by Dopamine (or Aromatic L-Amino Acid) Decarboxylase. In the absence of this enzyme, dopamine is not produced, leading to the symptoms seen in this patient. The high phenylalanine levels seen in this patient occur due to an unchanged precursor.  Option A, dopamine hydroxylase, is incorrect because this enzyme is responsible for the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine, and its deficiency does not lead to an increase in phenylalanine.   Option B, Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, is involved in the conversion of norepinephrine to epinephrine; its deficiency would not lead to the symptoms seen in this patient.  Option C, phenylalanine hydroxylase, when deficient, leads to phenylketonuria, which presents with intellectual disability, seizures, light skin and hair, but not the symptoms seen in the patient.  Option E, dihydropteridine reductase, when deficient, leads to a form of hyperphenylalaninemia that includes neuronal degeneration, but it does not cause the specific symptoms seen in this patient.

This patient's multiple anomalies (eg, renal, pulmonary, craniofacial, limb) suggest a diagnosis of trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome). This condition is often associated with polydactyly (especially postaxial, manifesting as an extra little finger or an extra toe), microphthalmia, microcephaly, cleft lip/cleft palate, and holoprosencephaly (failure of the forebrain to divide into lobes). Cardiac defects (in >80% of patients) and polycystic kidney disease are also commonly associated. Nonimmune hydrops can be seen prenatally. Survival beyond the first year is uncommon due to severe central nervous system abnormalities and life-threatening multiorgan dysfunction. Karyotyping (choice C) is the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis of trisomy 13.  Voiding cystourethrogram (Choice A) can be used to evaluate for vesicoureteral reflux or posterior urethral valves, which are not suggested by the clinical picture. Echocardiography (Choice B) can be used to evaluate structural heart disease, which this infant likely has given the trisomy 13, but it would not confirm the underlying cause. Blood cultures (Choice D) are used to evaluate for sepsis. This infant does not have signs of systemic infection (eg, temperature instability, lethargy, feeding difficulties). Chest x-ray (Choice E) can evaluate for pulmonary disease such as respiratory distress syndrome commonly seen in preterm infants but would not confirm the cause of this patient's condition.

This patient's fatigue, conjunctival pallor, and laboratory findings of normocytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume 84 Âµm^3), thrombocytosis (platelet count 488,000/mm^3), and an elevated reticulocyte index (3.8%) are consistent with anemia of chronic disease, now more appropriately termed anemia of inflammation. This is the second most common cause of anemia after anemia due to iron deficiency. It is seen in individuals with chronic illnesses such as infection, inflammatory conditions (e.g., autoimmune diseases), malignancy, and, as in this patient, sickle cell disease. Anemia of inflammation is generally normocytic, but can be microcytic if iron deficiency anemia coexists. The inflammatory state leads to increased hepcidin production, which downregulates iron transport and leads to sequestration of iron within storage sites, making it unavailable for erythropoiesis. This gives the clinical picture of iron deficiency anemia (e.g., low serum iron, low total iron-binding capacity saturation, high total iron-binding capacity), but with normal to increased ferritin levels. Therefore, treatment involves addressing the underlying disease and administering supplemental iron (Choice E).  Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) deficiency (Choice A) can cause sideroblastic anemia, characterized by the presence of ringed sideroblasts on bone marrow examination. Folate (vitamin B9, Choice B) deficiency and vitamin B12 (cobalamin, Choice C) deficiency cause megaloblastic anemia, which is characterized by a high mean corpuscular volume and hypersegmented neutrophils on peripheral smear. Vitamin D (Choice D) deficiency does not cause anemia but is associated with rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults.

This patient's photosensitivity, joint pain, and appearance of being tanned despite not spending much time outside due to her skin sensitivity are suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organ systems, including the skin, joints, kidneys, cardiovascular system, and nervous system. The photosensitivity is due to an inflammatory reaction that occurs in response to ultraviolet light exposure, which can cause a malar rash and also a generalized increase in skin pigmentation. Joint involvement (eg, fatigue, arthralgias, arthritis) occurs in most patients at some point in the course of their disease. Thus, the most appropriate next step is testing for anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), which is highly sensitive for SLE. A positive test should be followed by more specific tests for SLE (eg, anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-Smith antibodies).  Option B (Synovial fluid analysis) would be more indicative of infectious or gouty arthritis. Option C (Testing for parvovirus B19 antibodies) may be relevant for a patient with a slapped-cheek rash, arthralgias, and exposure to children, but would not explain this patient's photosensitivity. Option D (Iron studies) would be done to evaluate for hemochromatosis, which can also cause a bronzed skin appearance but typically includes symptoms of other endocrinopathies (eg, diabetes, hypogonadism), cardiac disease, and liver disease. Option E (Testing for rheumatoid factors) may be a consideration in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, but would not explain the photosensitivity or hyperpigmentation.

This patient's eczema, recurrent infections, and elevated IgE levels suggest a diagnosis of hyper-IgM syndrome. This immune disorder is characterized by normal or elevated IgA and IgE levels but decreased IgM levels due to a deficiency in CD40 ligand on T cells, which is necessary for class switching. As IgM is the primary immunoglobulin in early immune response, decreased levels can lead to recurrent infections, especially from encapsulated organisms.  None of the answer choices provided are commonly associated with hyper-IgM syndrome. However, anemia (Choice C) can occur in any chronic illness due to suppression of the bone marrow, so this could be the best answer given the choices, although it is not specifically linked to hyper-IgM syndrome.  Thrombocytopenia (Choice A) or leukopenia (Choice B) are not typically seen in hyper-IgM syndrome. Pancreatic insufficiency (Choice D) is more commonly seen in conditions like cystic fibrosis, not primary immune disorders. NADPH oxidase deficiency (Choice E) is associated with chronic granulomatous disease, which leads to recurrent infections, but it does not typically present with eczema or the immunoglobulin profile seen in this patient.  So, the correct choice is C - Anemia, though it is not a characteristic feature of hyper-IgM syndrome. It is the most likely among the given options.

The patient's urinalysis is consistent with nephrotic syndrome, as evidenced by a 24-hour urine protein excretion >3.5 g and 4+ urinary protein. Moreover, he has a rapid increase in urine albumin loss over 3 months (28 mg to 215 mg) in the setting of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (HbA1c >7% and increased fasting and postprandial blood glucose). The most likely pathological finding is diabetic nephropathy. Early diabetic nephropathy is characterized by hypertrophy and thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (option B). With increasing duration of disease, there is mesangial expansion and subsequent nodular glomerulosclerosis, ultimately leading to tubulointerstitial fibrosis and global glomerulosclerosis. Therefore, the correct answer is option D: Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules and tubulointerstitial fibrosis.  Option A is incorrect as the patient's urinalysis is indicative of renal pathology. Option B is incorrect as it represents early changes in diabetic nephropathy, but this patient's rapid increase in albuminuria and marked proteinuria suggest more advanced disease. Option C is incorrect as global glomerulosclerosis is seen in advanced stages of various renal diseases, but it is not specific for diabetic nephropathy. Option E is incorrect as although glomerular basement membrane thickening and mesangial expansion are seen in diabetic nephropathy, the patient's marked proteinuria suggests more advanced disease, which is characterized by nodular glomerulosclerosis (Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules).

This patient's persistent imbalance, bilateral hearing loss, and nystagmus suggests a diagnosis of Meniere disease (Option C).  Meniere disease is a disorder of the inner ear characterized by episodic vertigo, tinnitus, and sensorineural hearing loss. It is thought to be due to endolymphatic hydrops, or an excessive amount of fluid in the inner ear. The vertigo associated with Meniere disease is often severe and incapacitating, lasting for hours. Patients with Meniere disease can also experience aural fullness (sensation of ear pressure or fullness) and fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, which can eventually become permanent if left untreated.   Option A, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, typically presents with brief episodes of vertigo triggered by changes in head position. A negative Dix-Hallpike maneuver (as described in the question stem) essentially rules out this condition.   Option B, labyrinthitis, and Option E, vestibular neuritis, both involve inflammation of the inner ear or vestibular nerve, respectively. Both typically present with sudden, severe vertigo along with nausea and vomiting, unlike this patient's persistent but mild vertigo.   Option D, vertebrobasilar stroke, could potentially cause vertigo and imbalance; however, it would not explain this patient's hearing loss. In addition, a stroke would likely cause additional neurological symptoms, which are not observed in this patient.    Therefore, this patient's presentation is most consistent with Meniere disease.

The answer is A: Ovarian teratoma.   This patient's symptoms of dizziness, nausea, vomiting, ataxia, nystagmus (rhythmic movement of the globes), and past-pointing on finger-nose test are suggestive of cerebellar dysfunction. In conjunction with her positive anti-Yo antibody testthe presence of them typically implies an underlying malignancy, most often an ovarian tumor such as an ovarian teratoma (option A). Anti-Yo antibodies are paraneoplastic antibodies that attack Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, leading to the manifestations of cerebellar degeneration.  Neuroblastoma (option B) is a pediatric tumor of the adrenal medulla and typically presents with abdominal mass, opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome, or spinal cord compression. It is not typically associated with anti-Yo antibodies.  Breast cancer (option C) can be associated with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, but it is more commonly associated with anti-Ri antibodies, not anti-Yo antibodies.  Thymomas (option D) are typically associated with myasthenia gravis, which presents with fatigable weakness (particularly of the eyes and throat), not cerebellar signs.   Small cell lung cancer (option E) can be associated with a number of paraneoplastic syndromes, including Lambert-Eaton syndrome, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, and others. However, when it causes cerebellar degeneration, it is typically associated with anti-Hu antibodies, not anti-Yo antibodies.

The correct answer is D. Fragmentation of erythrocytes.    This patient's painful episodes and chronic hemolytic anemia suggest a diagnosis of sickle cell disease (SCD), which is common in individuals of sub-Saharan African descent. SCD is caused by a mutation in the ß-globin chain that promotes polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin S into long, insoluble chains that deform the erythrocyte into a sickle shape. Sickling is precipitated by hypoxia, acidosis, and dehydration, and leads to microvascular occlusion and tissue infarction, causing severe pain in the affected area (eg, dactylitis [swelling of the hands and feet] in infants, acute chest syndrome, abdominal pain, priapism). On peripheral smear, these cells appear as sickle-shaped (or "boat" shaped) and are often described as having undergone "fragmentation."   Option 'A' - 'Ring-shaped inclusions in erythrocytes' are seen in patients with malaria, which is not indicated in this case.  Option 'B' - 'Teardrop-shaped erythrocytes' are seen in conditions like myelofibrosis and other conditions that cause bone marrow fibrosis, which is not the case here.  Option 'C' - 'Nuclear remnants in erythrocytes' are indicative of conditions like thalassemia and megaloblastic anemia, not sickle cell disease.   Option 'E' - 'Erythrocytes with no central pallor' are seen in conditions like spherocytosis, not sickle cell disease.

The hormone being described in the question is melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), which is produced by the anterior and intermediate lobe of the pituitary gland and stimulates the production of pigments in the skin via the oxidation and polymerization of tyrosine. MSH is cosecreted with corticotropin (also known as adrenocorticotropic hormone, or ACTH). ACTH binds to receptors on the adrenal cortex, stimulating the release of cortisol, which in turn binds to glucocorticoid receptors. Therefore, the correct answer is 'A': Glucocorticoid receptor.  Explanation of the incorrect answers:  'B': Vasopressin receptor - Vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone, ADH) is produced by the posterior pituitary gland, not the anterior/intermediate lobe. It acts on the kidneys to retain water, and is not related to MSH or ACTH secretion.  'C': TSH receptor - Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) acts on the thyroid gland to stimulate the release of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). It is not cosecreted with ACTH or MSH.  'D': Mu receptor - Mu receptors are opioid receptors, stimulated by endorphins, enkephalins, and drugs like morphine. These are not related to ACTH or MSH secretion.  'E': Dopamine receptor - Dopamine acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain and can inhibit the release of prolactin from the anterior pituitary gland. It is not cosecreted with ACTH or MSH.

This patient's hyperglycemia and altered mental status is suggestive of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS). HHS is a complication of diabetes mellitus type 2, characterized by severe hyperglycemia, hyperosmolality, and dehydration in the absence of significant ketoacidosis. The most common causes are infections, medications, nonadherence to diabetes therapy, and acute illnesses. Symptoms are often nonspecific but can include polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, weakness, and visual disturbances. Neurologic symptoms can occur with severe hyperosmolality and may include seizures, hemiparesis, and coma. This patient's dry mucous membranes suggest that he is dehydrated, which is common in HHS because of osmotic diuresis. Initial treatment of HHS consists of IV fluids, insulin, and electrolyte replacement. Normal saline is used first to expand the intravascular volume, followed by insulin to decrease serum glucose. Given that this patient's potassium is low, he should also receive potassium supplementation with fluids and insulin to prevent further decrease in serum potassium level that will occur once insulin therapy is started (due to the intracellular shift of potassium). Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Insulin, normal saline, and potassium. Option A is incorrect because giving insulin alone would worsen his hypokalemia. Options B, C, and E are incorrect because they do not address all of his issues (i.e., hyperglycemia, dehydration, and hypokalemia).

The answer is D: Adhesions.  The patient's presentation of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, inability to pass flatus, and visible abdominal distention is consistent with a small bowel obstruction (SBO). A history of gradually worsening abdominal pain that was initially postprandial and later became constant, along with a lack of flatus and bowel movements for 4 days, supports this diagnosis. The CT findings of dilated loops of small bowel with collapsed large bowel further confirm the diagnosis of an SBO.  The most common cause of SBO in developed countries is postoperative adhesions, which account for approximately 75% of all cases. Although the patient's history does not mention prior abdominal surgery, it is still the most likely cause given the epidemiology.  Options A and B are less likely. Hernias are the second most common cause of SBO, but these patients typically present with localized pain and a palpable abdominal or inguinal mass. Tumors can also cause SBO but are typically seen in patients with a known history of malignancy.  Option C and E are not likely because Crohns disease and diverticulitis typically cause large bowel obstruction. Crohn's disease can cause SBO, but it usually presents with a long history of episodic abdominal pain and diarrhea, and often in younger patients. Diverticulitis typically presents with left lower quadrant abdominal pain, fever, and an elevated white blood cell count.

The patient's high fever, headache, photophobia, lethargy, and neck stiffness are characteristic of meningitis. In addition, her history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and recent chemotherapy render her immunocompromised and at high risk for this infection. Neck flexion causing hip and knee flexion (Brudzinski sign) is another classical sign of meningitis. This life-threatening disease requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. While lumbar puncture is commonly used to diagnose meningitis, it is contraindicated in cases showing signs of increased intracranial pressure or focal neurologic signs, such as the decreased muscle strength in the right upper extremity in this case, since it can cause brain herniation. Therefore, the best next step is a CT scan of the head (Option A) to rule out space-occupying lesions, such as abscesses or hemorrhage, before lumbar puncture.  Option B: MRI of the brain is more detailed than a CT scan, but it also takes longer to perform. In this case, where time is crucial, a CT scan is the better choice.  Option C: While immediate antibiotic treatment is critical in bacterial meningitis, it is also important to first image the patients head with a CT scan before performing a lumbar puncture due to the risk of brain herniation.  Option D: As explained above, lumbar puncture is contraindicated in this patient at this time due to the risk of brain herniation.  Option E: Acyclovir therapy would be indicated if there were suspicion for herpes simplex virus encephalitis, which this patient's presentation does not suggest.

This patient's chest pain with exertion that is relieved with rest and nitroglycerin is consistent with stable angina, which is due to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen demand and supply. Stable angina is most commonly caused by atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, in which narrowing of the coronary arteries prevents adequate blood flow to meet increased myocardial oxygen demand during exertion. Nitroglycerin alleviates this myocardial ischemia and the associated chest pain by causing 'Coronary arterial vasodilation' (Option C) and reducing myocardial oxygen demand through systemic venodilation (which decreases preload).  'Delayed electrical conduction' (Option A) is not a mechanism of action of nitroglycerin. Antiarrhythmic drugs can delay electrical conduction and may be used in conditions such as atrial fibrillation or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, which are not present in this patient.  'Decreased venous pooling' (Option B) can decrease preload and myocardial oxygen demand but is not a primary mechanism of nitroglycerin. Physical maneuvers (eg, leg raising, squatting) and drugs that cause venous constriction can decrease venous pooling.  'Increased atherosclerotic plaque stability' (Option D) can reduce the risk of acute coronary syndrome but is not a mechanism of nitroglycerin. Statins have been shown to increase plaque stability.  'Decreased end-diastolic pressure' (Option E) can decrease myocardial wall stress and thus oxygen demand. However, nitroglycerin primarily decreases preload and afterload through systemic venodilation and does not directly decrease end-diastolic pressure.  Therefore, out of all the options, 'Coronary arterial vasodilation' (Option C) is the most likely explanation for the improvement of this patient's chest pain.

The most likely cause of this patient's current symptoms is 'C': Cardiac embolism. This is suggested by the presence of bilateral, wedge-shaped cortical infarcts in both occipital lobes. The procedure of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) can cause a transient period of low cardiac output, which increases the risk of emboli forming in the heart. These emboli can then travel to the brain, leading to the occlusion of multiple vessels and subsequent cerebral infarctions. The patient's visual loss is due to involvement of the occipital lobes (responsible for vision), and the arm weakness is due to involvement of the parietal lobes (responsible for motor function).  Option 'A': Amyloid angiopathy typically causes lobar hemorrhages rather than infarcts, and it primarily affects elderly patients.  Option 'B': Lipohyalinosis is a small vessel disease typically seen in hypertensive patients and would not cause the bilateral, large-vessel infarcts seen in this patient.  Option 'D': Atherothrombosis typically leads to a single, unilateral cortical or subcortical infarct, not multiple bilateral infarcts.  Option 'E': Systemic hypotension can lead to bilateral watershed infarcts, which occur in between the territories of the major cerebral arteries. They are typically seen in the parasagittal region and do not directly affect the occipital lobes or cause the symptoms seen in this patient.

The correct answer is D. Simple shave biopsy.  The description of the thigh lesion with the slightly raised border is concerning for the possibility of melanoma, which is the most dangerous form of skin cancer. This lesion should be evaluated with a biopsy, and the correct procedure is a simple shave biopsy. It is crucial to make an early diagnosis in melanoma because it is a rapidly spreading condition that can be fatal if not treated promptly.   Here's why the other options are incorrect:  Option A: Further questioning: While a thorough history is essential in medicine, in this case, the physical description of the lesion is concerning enough that it warrants a biopsy regardless of other risk factors.   Option B: Topical corticosteroid: This is not the appropriate treatment for a lesion that could be melanoma. Topical corticosteroids are generally used for skin inflammatory conditions, not for potential malignancies.  Option C: Reassurance: Given the concerning features of the lesion, reassurance without further evaluation would not be appropriate.   Option E: Full thickness biopsy: While a full thickness biopsy (or excisional biopsy) might be used for lesions where melanoma is strongly suspected based on physical examination, a simple shave biopsy is usually the first step in evaluation. Excisional biopsy might be reserved for after a shave biopsy confirms the diagnosis.

The most likely etiology for this patient's hearing loss is E - Presbycusis. Presbycusis, or age-related hearing loss, is the most common cause of hearing loss in the elderly, and it presents as symmetric, bilateral, sensorineural hearing loss. It is often associated with difficulty hearing in noisy environments and trouble understanding high-pitched voices. The Weber test does not lateralize in sensorineural hearing loss, and the Rinne test demonstrates air conduction to be greater than bone conduction (as it should be in normal hearing). Both of these findings are present in this patient, which supports the diagnosis of presbycusis.  Option A - Medication regimen: Some medications can cause ototoxicity, leading to hearing loss. However, there is no information given about the patient's current medications. Furthermore, medication-induced hearing loss would typically affect one ear before the other, and this patient has symmetric hearing loss in both ears.  Option B - Otitis externa: This condition, also known as swimmer's ear, would present with symptoms like ear pain, itching or drainage, which this patient does not have.  Option C - Otitis media: Otitis media can cause hearing loss, but it typically presents with symptoms such as ear pain, fever, and feeling of fullness in the ear. This patient does not have these symptoms.  Option D - Otosclerosis: Otosclerosis is a condition that causes conductive hearing loss due to abnormal bone growth in the middle ear. However, the Rinne test in this case, showing that air conduction is greater than bone conduction, suggests sensorineural rather than conductive hearing loss.

The most appropriate next step in management is 'C: RT-PCR testing'.   This patient's presentation of fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath occurring after a trip to China is suggestive of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Radiographic findings of bilateral patchy infiltrates and laboratory findings of leukopenia may also be seen in patients with COVID-19. The diagnosis of COVID-19 is confirmed via detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing.  Regarding the other options:  'A: Lopinavir-ritonavir treatment' - This is an antiretroviral therapy used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and it was initially considered as a potential treatment for COVID-19. However, clinical trials have shown no benefit in patients with severe COVID-19.  'B: Remdesivir treatment' - This is an antiviral medication that was shown to have a benefit in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. However, it is not the first step in management. A definitive diagnosis should be made first.  'D: Supportive therapy and monitoring' - While this is important in the management of a patient with COVID-19, the first step should be confirming the diagnosis.  'E: Systemic corticosteroid administration' - This has been shown to be beneficial in patients with severe COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen. However, it is not the first step in management and should be reserved for patients who are critically ill.

The patient's presentation of a slowly progressive, painless, draining mass in the mandibular area, along with gram-positive filamentous rods on Gram stain, is consistent with actinomycosis. Actinomycosis is an indolent infection caused by Actinomyces species, which are normal flora of the oropharynx, gastrointestinal tract, and female genital tract. The most common form of disease, cervicofacial actinomycosis, often occurs after dental procedures, oral surgery, or oral trauma. Patients usually present with a "lumpy jaw" due to the formation of multiple abscesses and draining sinus tracts. Actinomyces are gram positive, but because they form filamentous branches, they can resemble fungi. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating sulfur granules, which are hard, yellow colonies of Actinomyces, on histopathologic examination. The treatment of actinomycosis includes surgical drainage and long-term, high-dose penicillin therapy. This patient has a history of amoxicillin-induced rash, which does not preclude the use of penicillin in the future. Minor skin reactions (eg, maculopapular rash) to amoxicillin, especially when it is given for Epstein-Barr virus infection (as in this patient, who likely had infectious mononucleosis with streptococcal pharyngitis), do not increase the risk for serious reactions (eg, anaphylaxis) with future penicillin use. Therefore, the answer is Penicillin V (Option D).  A (Surgical resection of the mass): This is an incorrect answer because while surgical drainage is needed, long-term antibiotic therapy is also necessary.   B (Doxycycline), C (Trimethoprim-sulfamethaxazole), E (Cephalexin): These antibiotics are not the first-line treatment for actinomycosis.

This patient's fever, fatigue, splenomegaly, and pancytopenia (evidenced by inability to move her right arm or leg due to a stroke, nonpalpable purpura indicating thrombocytopenia, and pallor indicating anemia) suggest a diagnosis of acute leukemia, most likely acute myeloid leukemia given her age. Acute leukemia is a clonal proliferation of myeloid or lymphoid precursors (blasts) in the bone marrow. The blasts crowd out normal hematopoietic cells, leading to anemia (fatigue, pallor), thrombocytopenia (bleeding, purpura), and neutropenia (infections). Normocytic, normochromic anemia with an elevated reticulocyte count (choice D) would not be expected because acute leukemia results in a decreased production of all cell lines, including red blood cells, leading to a low reticulocyte count. The anemia of leukemia is typically normocytic and normochromic with a low reticulocyte count, reflecting an underproduction of red blood cells.  As for the other options: Decreased platelets (choice A) are expected because of bone marrow infiltration by blasts. Normal PTT and PT (choice B) are expected because the coagulation factors (which are synthesized in the liver) are typically not affected by leukemia. Elevated creatinine (choice C) may be seen due to tumor lysis syndrome, a complication of chemotherapy that results in hyperuricemia and acute kidney injury. Elevated bilirubin (choice E) may be seen due to excessive cell turnover, leading to increased unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin.

The patient's symptoms of chest pain that worsens with coughing, fever, tachycardia, and rust-colored sputum, along with inspiratory crackles heard in the right lower lung on physical examination, are suggestive of a lobar pneumonia, likely caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. This is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, especially in patients with chronic medical conditions, smokers, and the elderly. The rust-colored sputum is quite characteristic. The chest X-ray most likely would show a lobar consolidation. Therefore, option B, bacterial pneumonia, is the most likely cause of the patient's current symptoms.  Option A, pericarditis, typically presents with pleuritic chest pain, relieved by sitting up and leaning forward, there's usually a friction rub on cardiac examination, and the ECG would show widespread ST elevation and PR depression.   Option C, pulmonary embolism, may cause pleuritic chest pain, and sometimes hemoptysis, but the sputum would not typically be rust-colored. Physical examination may reveal tachypnea and tachycardia, but lung auscultation is usually normal.  Option D, pulmonary edema, generally occurs in the setting of heart failure. Symptoms would include dyspnea, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and auscultation would reveal bilateral crackles.   Option E, bronchogenic carcinoma, is a possibility given the patient's long history of smoking, but it would not likely cause acute symptoms such as fever and rust-colored sputum. Classic symptoms of lung cancer include cough, hemoptysis, weight loss, and recurrent infections.

The most appropriate next step in management is to administer Tdap (Option C).  The patient's wound is at high risk for tetanus due to the contaminated puncture wound (rusty nail) and the possible absence of booster vaccination. Tetanus is a serious infection caused by Clostridium tetani, and wounds that are puncture-type, contaminated with dirt/feces, or resulting from a crush injury are particularly susceptible.  In the US, the standard childhood immunizations include a primary series of tetanus toxoid (contained in the DTaP vaccine) administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months and boosters at 4-6 years and 11-12 years. This patient's last shot was before starting middle school (around age 11-12 years), so this may have been the booster dose. However, since it's not exactly clear, the safest decision would be to provide a booster for tetanus.   Tdap is preferred over Td for individuals 11-64 years old who have not previously received Tdap. Tdap includes protection against pertussis (whooping cough), which is beneficial since teenagers and adults are often the source of pertussis infection in infants. Tetanus immune globulin (TIG) is not needed in this case because it's used for individuals who are not immunized or incompletely immunized.  Option A is wrong because simply cleaning the wound is not enough for a high-risk injury. Options B, D, and E are also incorrect because Tdap is preferred over DT or Td for this age group, and TIG is not needed.

The boy's recurrent, prolonged nosebleeds and lack of response to ristocetin suggests a diagnosis of Hemophilia A or B, both of which are X-linked recessive disorders. These conditions are characterized by deficiencies in clotting factors VIII (hemophilia A) and IX (hemophilia B). The fact that his blood didn't agglutinate even with the addition of normal plasma indicates a clotting factor problem.  The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:  Option A: Autosomal dominant disorders are typically present in every generation of an affected family. Since the child's family history is unknown and the condition is not common in the population, this option is less likely.  Option B: Autosomal recessive disorders need two copies of the mutated gene to express the disease. This child may not have the disease if it was autosomal recessive, as the parents would likely be carriers and the chance of inheriting two mutated genes would be 25%.  Option C: Mitochondrial inheritance is from mother to all offspring, not related to this case.  Option D: X-linked dominant disorders are usually more severe in males, but they also cause disease in female carriers. The mother would typically show some signs of the disease, which is not mentioned in the scenario.  Therefore, the correct answer is 'E': X-linked recessive.

This patient's pharyngitis followed by hematuria, proteinuria, and RBC casts is suggestive of acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), thus the renal biopsy is most likely to show 'Crescents of fibrin and plasma proteins' (Choice C). APSGN usually occurs 1-2 weeks after a group A streptococcal infection of the throat (as in this patient) or skin. It is less common in patients with streptococcal impetigo. APSGN is typically characterized by hematuria (cola-colored urine), hypertension, edema, and mild-to-moderate proteinuria. RBC casts in the urine are a result of glomerular bleeding. Findings on light microscopy include enlarged and hypercellular glomeruli.  Now let's discuss why the other options are incorrect:  Choice A: 'Capillary wire looping' is a characteristic finding in lupus nephritis.  Choice B: 'Splitting of the glomerular basement membrane' is a key histologic feature of Alport syndrome, a genetic disorder that causes progressive renal failure, sensorineural hearing loss, and ocular abnormalities.  Choice D: 'IgA mesangial deposition' is a characteristic feature of IgA nephropathy (Berger disease), the most common cause of primary glomerulonephritis worldwide. It's typified by hematuria that occurs concurrently with or shortly after a respiratory or gastrointestinal illness, but not 1-2 weeks after, as in APSGN.  Choice E: 'Granular deposits of IgG, IgM, and C3 complement' are indicative of immune complex deposition, which can be seen in conditions like membranous nephropathy and lupus nephritis, but not in APSGN.

This patient's frequent urination, chronic mild cough, and visible jugular pulsations (indicative of jugular venous distension) suggest the diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF). In CHF, impaired cardiac output leads to renal hypoperfusion and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Persistent RAAS activation results in sodium and fluid retention and stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. These compensatory responses increase preload and afterload and contribute to further myocardial injury. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including captopril, have been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure and are a first-line treatment in such patients. However, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) like valsartan can be used in patients who are intolerant to ACE inhibitors due to cough (Choice B). ACE inhibitors can cause cough by promoting the accumulation of bradykinin, which can stimulate afferent nerve endings in the cough reflex pathway.  Stopping metformin (Choice A) would not be necessary unless the patient had a contraindication to its use, such as kidney failure or metabolic acidosis. Rosiglitazone (Choice C) is an anti-diabetic medication and is not specifically used for the treatment of heart failure. In fact, it is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction and heart failure. Stopping furosemide (Choice D) would exacerbate fluid overload, worsening heart failure symptoms. Exenatide (Choice E) is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist used for management of type 2 diabetes, not for CHF. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

The patient's presentation of fever, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea with polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the stool is suggestive of an invasive bacterial enteritis. This is most likely due to ingestion of a pathogenic bacteria in contaminated food. Shigella and Salmonella are common causes of bloody diarrhea and are often found in contaminated food or water. Both of these bacteria invade the intestinal mucosa, causing fever, abdominal pain, and inflammatory diarrhea characterized by the presence of leukocytes and blood in the stool. Among the choices provided, Shigella and Salmonella are most commonly associated with 'Home-canned vegetables' (Option D) due to improper canning and storage procedures.  Option A, 'Reheated rice', is typically associated with Bacillus cereus, which causes two types of gastrointestinal illness - an emetic type and a diarrheal type. Neither typically present with bloody diarrhea.  Option B, 'Yogurt dip', could potentially contain Listeria, which can cause a febrile gastroenteritis, but it is more commonly associated with meningitis and sepsis, especially in immunocompromised patients, pregnant women, and newborns.  Option C, 'Toxic mushrooms', can cause a variety of symptoms including abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea, but this is typically non-inflammatory and not associated with fever.  Option E, 'Omelette', could potentially be contaminated with Salmonella, but this usually causes a non-inflammatory, non-bloody diarrhea. It can also be associated with Staphylococcus aureus if the food was left at room temperature for long periods, but this also typically causes non-inflammatory gastroenteritis.

The correct answer is C: Past medical history.  This patient's CT scan and biopsy results indicating malignancy, gland formation, and mucus production suggest a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the lung. The most common type of lung cancer in nonsmokers, adenocarcinoma, often arises from the mucous-producing glands in the periphery of the lung. This malignancy is also the most common type of lung cancer in women and individuals under 45 years old. Though the woman has never smoked, her history of peptic ulcer disease with positive H. pylori biopsy indicates a potential risk. It has been observed in studies that H. pylori, an organism capable of provoking a significant inflammatory response, may play a role in the development of extragastric malignancies, including lung cancer.   Option A (Medication) is incorrect as there is no information in the patient's history suggesting any medication that might have predisposed her to lung cancer.   Option B (Occupational history) is incorrect because teaching is not typically associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. Certain occupations, such as mining, construction, and shipbuilding, are potential risk factors due to the prevalence of asbestos in these occupations.  Option D (Race) is incorrect as there is no established link between being Caucasian and having an increased risk of adenocarcinoma of the lung.  Option E (Gender) is incorrect because even though adenocarcinoma is the most common type of lung cancer in women, being a woman is not considered a risk factor in developing lung cancer. Risk factors would include smoking, family history of lung cancer, and exposure to certain toxic substances.

The most likely cause of this patient's multiple fractures is 'A': Abnormal collagen production.   This young boy's multiple fractures, blue sclerae (which is the figure A finding), and normal intelligence are highly suggestive of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a genetic disorder characterized by bones that break easily. OI is primarily caused by mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes, which are responsible for the production of the protein collagen. Abnormal collagen production weakens the connective tissues, making the bones more fragile and prone to fractures.  Option 'B': Decreased collagen hydroxylation can lead to scurvy, which is caused by vitamin C deficiency. Scurvy does cause weakened bones, but it also has numerous other symptoms, such as anemia, gingivitis, and skin hemorrhages, which are not mentioned in this case.  Option 'C': Increased adenylyl cyclase activity is associated with certain endocrine disorders, such as McCune-Albright syndrome, which can cause polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (abnormal bone growth) and skin pigmentation, but doesn't fit the case scenario.  Option 'D': Mutation in neurofibromin is associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of non-cancerous tumors along nerves in the skin, brain, and other parts of the body. It also doesn't fit the case scenario.  Option 'E': Non-accidental trauma could cause multiple fractures, but the presence of blue sclerae and normal development suggest a genetic disorder rather than child abuse.

The most likely answer is A: Needle injury to ulnar nerve secondary to blind line placement.  The ulnar nerve provides sensation to the palmar and dorsal surfaces of the small finger and half of the ring finger. It also controls most of the intrinsic muscles of the hand, including digit abduction, thumb adduction, and thumb-index finger pinch. This patient's upper extremity symptoms are therefore consistent with ulnar nerve injury. In this case, because the symptoms developed shortly after removal of an infected axillary arterial line, the most likely cause is iatrogenic injury during blind line placement.    Option B is incorrect because the median nerve controls sensation and motor function in a different distribution than what is described in this case.  Option C is incorrect because while coagulopathy can lead to spontaneous bleeding and compression of nerves, this patient's symptoms localize to the ulnar nerve, which would not be affected by axillary line placement.  Option D is not correct because while coagulopathy can cause median nerve compression (usually in the context of a hematoma in the carpal tunnel), this patient's symptoms are consistent with ulnar nerve, not median nerve, injury.  Option E is incorrect because stretch injuries usually occur as a result of forceful or sustained abnormal posturing of the limb, not frequent repositioning. Furthermore, the abrupt onset of his symptoms after the line placement strongly suggests a direct needle injury.

The correct answer is 'E'. This patient's sudden onset severe testicular pain, with radiation to the lower abdominal quadrant and thigh, is highly suggestive of testicular torsion. This condition is usually due to spermatic cord twisting that results in compromised blood flow to the testis. The absence of the cremasteric reflex (i.e., no elevation of the testicle when the inner thigh is stroked) supports this diagnosis. Urgent testicular Doppler ultrasound is the next step in management to evaluate for the absence of blood flow, confirming the diagnosis.   Option A, CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, is not appropriate in this case because it does not provide as much detail or accuracy as an ultrasound for the diagnosis of testicular torsion.  Option B, IV antibiotics, would be incorrect because this presentation is not suggestive of an infection requiring antibiotics, such as epididymitis or orchitis.  Option C, observation and morphine, is not the best option due to the urgency of the situation. Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency, and delay in treatment can result in loss of the testicle.  Option D, surgical exploration, might be the next step following an ultrasound that confirms testicular torsion. However, in this case, ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis of torsion is the immediate next step before proceeding to surgery.

This woman's hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, and anterior neck swelling that does not move with swallowing are concerning for a thyroid malignancy. Her symptoms are likely due to local invasion of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (causing hoarseness), esophagus (causing dysphagia) and trachea (causing an anterior neck mass). Moreover, the findings of lower extremity swelling and decreased femoral and pedal pulses suggest vascular invasion, which is classically seen in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. This is a rapidly growing, highly aggressive cancer commonly seen in older women. It invades local structures and often presents as a rapidly enlargening, firm, fixed neck mass. Histology characteristically shows spindle-shaped tumor cells and areas of necrosis (choice B).  The other options each describe a different thyroid pathology: Choice A: Atypical nuclei and concentric lamellar calcifications are seen in papillary thyroid carcinoma, which usually presents as a non-tender, mobile thyroid nodule. Choice C: Collagen deposition and decreased number of follicles are characteristic of thyroid fibrosis, which can be seen in Riedel thyroiditis. Choice D: Giant cells and noncaseating granulomas are seen in granulomatous thyroiditis, such as subacute granulomatous (De Quervain) thyroiditis. Choice E: Lymphocytic infiltrate and germinal center formation are seen in Hashimoto thyroiditis, an autoimmune disease that often presents with hypothyroidism.

Given the history and results from the transthoracic needle biopsy, the most likely cause for the lung nodules in this patient is a malignant transformation of cells, as in option B. Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) often arises from malignant transformation of the lung's epithelial cells.   Option A is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and biopsy results do not suggest a fungal infection such as Aspergillus infection. Furthermore, Aspergillus infections usually occur in individuals with a compromised immune system, which is not noted in this patient's history.  Option C is incorrect as there is no information indicating that the patient has an infection caused by gram-negative bacteria that grow on charcoal yeast agar. The biopsy results indicate that the nodules are cancerous, not infectious in nature.  Option D is incorrect because it suggests the nodules are adenocarcinoma, a type of NSCLC that is often associated with a history of smoking. However, the patient's history does not include smoking. The biopsy results do not specify the subtype of NSCLC, and therefore proliferation of cells that produce mucin cannot be confirmed.  Option E is incorrect because it suggests the tumors were "seeded" or spread from elsewhere in the body, via the pulmonary arteries. However, the biopsy indicates a primary lung cancer, not metastasis from elsewhere in the body.

The patient's symptoms suggest that she is experiencing chronic rejection of her lung transplant, which is typically characterized by bronchiolitis obliterans, a condition marked by inflammation and fibrosis of the small airways or bronchioles. This is most commonly a result of a T-cell mediated immune response against the foreign transplant tissue, specifically against foreign major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) on the cells of the transplanted organ. Therefore, the best answer is option B: 'Cytotoxic T lymphocytes reacting against foreign MHCs'.  As for the other options:  A: Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia is a possible complication following a lung transplant, but it would typically present with different symptoms, like fever, cough, purulent sputum, and infiltrates on chest X-ray.  C: Lymphocytic inflammation of the bronchiolar wall is a potential part of the pathophysiology of chronic rejection, but it is not the primary mechanism. It's the cytotoxic T-cell mediated damage that plays a central role.  D: T-cell mediated vascular damage can also occur, but it is more characteristic of acute rejection. Chronic rejection, as seems to be the case here, is more often associated with damage to the bronchioles rather than the vasculature.  E: Proliferation of grafted immunocompetent T cells is a phenomenon seen in graft-versus-host disease, which is a complication of bone marrow/stem cell transplants, not solid organ transplants like a lung transplant.

The correct answer is C: Bupropion.   This patients history and symptoms are consistent with major depressive disorder (MDD), which is characterized by depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities along with at least four additional symptoms such as fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, diminished concentration, or insomnia for at least a 2-week period. First-line treatment options for MDD include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), mirtazapine, and bupropion. However, an important consideration in choosing an appropriate treatment regimen is the patients specific symptomatology, past medical history, and potential for adverse effects of the medications.  Bupropion, an atypical antidepressant, inhibits norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake. It is less likely to cause sexual side effects than SSRIs and SNRIs and can therefore be beneficial in patients who have experienced these side effects with other treatments. However, bupropion does carry a risk of causing or exacerbating anxiety and insomnia, which this patient is already experiencing, thus it should be avoided in this case.  Fluoxetine (option B) is a SSRI and first-line treatment for depression. Mirtazapine (option D), an atypical antidepressant, is also a first-line treatment and can be particularly helpful in patients with insomnia and lack of appetite. Vortioxetine (option A) and vilazodone (option E) are both atypical antidepressants and are also considered acceptable treatments for MDD. They are all less likely to exacerbate his anxiety or insomnia than bupropion.

Decreasing the cutoff for severe hyponatremia to < 115 mEq/L would increase the specificity and decrease the positive predictive value (PPV). This means that:  - Specificity would increase because a cutoff point of < 115 mEq/L would make the test more specific to severe cases of hyponatremia that require treatment with hypertonic saline. This is because fewer patients with non-severe hyponatremia would be wrongly identified as requiring treatment (fewer false positives).  - Positive predictive value (PPV) would decrease because, while the test would be more specific, it would also be less likely to correctly identify patients who require treatment (more false negatives). In other words, among patients who test positive (serum sodium < 115 mEq/L), fewer would actually require treatment.  Option A is incorrect because increasing specificity would not affect the negative predictive value (NPV), which refers to the probability that patients with a negative test result (serum sodium = 115 mEq/L) truly do not need treatment.  Option B is incorrect because decreasing the cutoff would not decrease the specificity but increase it. Also, the negative predictive value would not be affected, as explained above.  Option C is incorrect because the change in cutoff would not increase sensitivity. In fact, it would decrease it, because it would be less able to identify patients who truly need treatment. The decrease in positive predictive value is correct.  Option D is incorrect because, while sensitivity would indeed decrease, the positive predictive value would also decrease, not stay the same.   Option E is the correct answer.

The correct answer is E: HER-2/neu positive.  HER-2/neu is a proto-oncogene that codes for a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, and it is amplified in approximately 20% of breast cancers. The HER-2/neu-positive subtype of breast cancer is associated with a more aggressive disease, higher recurrence rate, and decreased survival. Although therapies targeting HER-2/neu (eg, trastuzumab) have improved prognosis, HER-2/neu positivity remains an indicator of poor prognosis.  Option A: Axillary lymphadenopathy does indicate a higher stage of disease (which generally correlates with prognosis), but HER-2/neu positivity is a more important prognostic factor as it indicates a more aggressive disease subtype.  Option B: Increased age is a risk factor for developing breast cancer, but it does not significantly affect the prognosis once the disease has developed.  Option C: ER positivity is actually associated with a better prognosis in breast cancer. ER-positive tumors are less aggressive and can be managed with hormone therapy (eg, tamoxifen), which improves overall survival.  Option D: Inflammatory subtype is associated with a poor prognosis. However, the question stem does not provide any evidence of inflammatory breast cancer, which is characterized by red, swollen, warm, and often tender breast, often without a discrete palpable mass.   So, even though options A and D could potentially indicate a poor prognosis, the question specifically identifies the tumor as being HER-2/neu-positive, which is a stronger indicator of poor prognosis.

This patient's cheek pain, purulent nasal discharge, and pain with bending over (which changes pressure and worsens sinus pain) suggest acute bacterial sinusitis, likely secondary to Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae. Bacterial sinusitis is usually a complication of a viral upper respiratory infection, with obstruction of the sinus ostia leading to stasis of secretions and subsequent bacterial growth. It is typically diagnosed clinically, with imaging reserved for recurrent or complicated cases. Current guidelines recommend empiric treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate to cover the most common pathogens, including beta-lactamase producing strains (Option A).  Amphotericin and debridement (Option B) would be used for invasive fungal sinusitis, which is typically seen in patients with immune compromise (eg, diabetes, neutropenia). However, these patients usually present with acute onset of fever, headache, and facial pain, and rapidly progress to have black nasal eschar or ophthalmologic signs (eg, diplopia, proptosis).   Performing a CT (Option C) or MRI (Option D) of the head would not be necessary as a first step in management since the patient's symptoms are classic for acute bacterial sinusitis, and imaging is reserved for cases that are recurrent or complicated.  Pseudoephedrine (Option E) is a sympathomimetic that can cause vasoconstriction, reducing sinusoidal edema. However, it does not have any antimicrobial activity and would not address the likely bacterial cause of this patient's symptoms.

This boy's findings of bilateral inferior lens dislocation, long and slender fingers (arachnodactyly), a high-arched palate, thumb and 5th finger overlap when gripping the opposite wrist (thumb sign), and easily stretched skin are characteristic of Marfan syndrome. This syndrome is caused by a deficiency of fibrillin 1 (option B), a glycoprotein necessary for the formation of elastic fibers found in connective tissue. The lens of the eye is held in place by suspensory ligaments made up of fibrillin; their weakening can result in lens dislocation. Other common findings in Marfan syndrome include tall stature, scoliosis, and a predisposition to aortic dissection.  Option A, Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency, results in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, which is characterized by uric acid accumulation, resulting in gout, kidney stones, and self-mutilation behaviors.  Option C, Type V collagen deficiency, is seen in the classical form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), which is characterized by hyperextensible skin and hypermobile joints, but not the ocular or cardiovascular manifestations seen in this patient.  Option D, Cystathionine synthase deficiency, results in homocystinuria. Although homocystinuria can mimic Marfan syndrome (tall stature, lens dislocation), the lens tends to dislocate upwards and inwards, and patients often present with intellectual disability and thromboembolic events.  Option E, Galactokinase deficiency, results in galactosemia, which leads to symptoms like cataracts, intellectual disability, and liver disease in the neonatal period due to the accumulation of galactose and its toxic metabolites.

This patient's symptoms of fatigue, weakness, hyporeflexia, and electrocardiographic changes (T-wave flattening and ST-segment depression) are suggestive of hyperkalemia, which can occur in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus due to a decrease in insulin action. Insulin promotes the movement of potassium into cells, reducing the concentration of potassium in the bloodstream. However, in a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus, insulin deficiency can lead to decreased movement of potassium into cells, causing hyperkalemia.   In response to hyperkalemia, the kidneys increase potassium excretion. This is achieved primarily in the principal cells of the collecting ducts via increased activity of luminal potassium channels (choice E). This allows for more potassium to be secreted into the tubule and excreted in the urine.  As for the other options: Option A: Increased activity of H+/K+ antiporter in a-intercalated cells could actually exacerbate hyperkalemia as this antiporter moves potassium into the blood and hydrogen ions into the urine.  Option B: The activity of epithelial sodium channels in principal cells, which are involved in sodium reabsorption, is not directly related to potassium homeostasis. Option C: Decreased activity of the Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter in the loop of Henle would reduce sodium reabsorption and potentially lead to hyponatremia, not hyperkalemia. Option D: Decreased activity of the Na+/H+ antiporter in the proximal convoluted tubule would impair sodium reabsorption and acid-base balance, but it would not directly impact potassium homeostasis.

The correct answer is B. Axillary nerve.   This patient's presentation is consistent with an injury to the supraspinatus muscle. The supraspinatus is one of the four muscles of the rotator cuff and contributes to shoulder stability. It is primarily responsible for the first 15 degrees of arm abduction. Injuries are common in athletes who perform overhead throwing movements (e.g., baseball pitchers, tennis players). The "empty can" test, in which the patient resists downward pressure on the arm while it is elevated to 90 degrees and internally rotated (thumb pointed down), is commonly used to evaluate for supraspinatus muscle injury. The supraspinatus muscle is innervated by the suprascapular nerve.   Option A, Accessory nerve, is incorrect because this nerve innervates the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles, not the muscles of the rotator cuff. Option C, Long thoracic nerve, is incorrect because this nerve innervates the serratus anterior muscle, not the muscles of the rotator cuff. Option D, Subscapular nerve, is incorrect because this nerve innervates the subscapularis muscle, not the supraspinatus muscle. Option E, Suprascapular nerve, is incorrect because this nerve innervates the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles.  However, in this case the injury seems to be related to the axillary nerve as it is responsible for deltoid muscle (arm abduction from 15-90 degrees) which seems more consistent with this patient's difficulty on lifting his arm.  Also the axillary nerve innervates the teres minor which is also part of the rotator cuff and can be damaged due to repetitive overhead movements.

The ECG is not shown in this scenario, but given the patient's presentation, it sounds like he might be experiencing episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, a common arrhythmia in the elderly.  The first line of treatment for stable, symptomatic patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is rate control, which can be achieved through the use of beta-blockers or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is the 'Administration of metoprolol' (Option A).   Now, let's review why the other options are not ideal:  Option B: 'Administration of magnesium sulfate' - This is used in the management of torsades de pointes (a form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia), pre-eclampsia, and severe asthma, but not typically atrial fibrillation. Also, the patient's magnesium level is normal.  Option C: 'Administration of amiodarone' - This is a potent antiarrhythmic that is typically reserved for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias or for rate control in atrial fibrillation when other measures have failed. It should not be the first-line therapy due to its potential for serious side effects, including thyroid, lung, liver, and eye toxicity.  Option D: 'Intermittent transvenous overdrive pacing' - This is an option for patients with symptomatic bradycardia that is unresponsive to medical therapy. It would not be appropriate in this case where the patient's heart rate is not excessively low.  Option E: 'Administration of potassium chloride' - This would be the appropriate intervention for a patient with hypokalemia, which could potentially cause arrhythmias. However, this patient's potassium level is normal.

The correct answer is A. Loss of taste from posterior 1/3 of tongue.  Explanation: The facial nerve (VII) is the cranial nerve that passes through the parotid gland. It has several branches with diverse functions including the chorda tympani which carries taste sensation from the anterior two thirds of the tongue and the nerve to the stapedius muscle in the ear. However, it's the Glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) which passes near the parotid gland and is responsible for taste sensation from the posterior 1/3 of the tongue.  The other options are wrong for the following reasons: - Option B: Loss of general sensation in anterior 2/3 of tongue - This is mediated by the lingual nerve, a branch of the mandibular nerve (V3), not a nerve that passes through the parotid gland. - Option C: Paralysis of lateral rectus muscle - This would be a consequence of damage to the abducens nerve (VI), not a nerve that passes through the parotid gland. - Option D: Changes in Hearing - Damage to the vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII) would result in changes in hearing, not a nerve that passes through the parotid gland. - Option E: Horner's syndrome - Damage to the sympathetic chain, not a nerve passing through the parotid gland, would result in Horner's syndrome.

The correct answer is B. 'Maintenance of resting sodium and potassium concentrations'.    The protein described seems to function as an ion channel, which allows ions to pass through the membrane down their concentration gradients without using ATP. The fact that the proteinâs activity increases linearly with substrate concentration without saturation suggests that it acts via facilitated diffusion, as active transport proteins would saturate at high substrate concentrations due to limited numbers of transport proteins.   Furthermore, the fact that changing the electrical charge across the membrane does not affect the protein's activity lines up with the properties of ion channels, which are typically not voltage-gated. The fact that its activity can be increased by adding a small amount of an additional substance could be referring to a co-factor or a modulator.  Option A ('Causing depolarization during action potentials') is incorrect because voltage-gated channels, not passive channels, are involved in action potential propagation.  Option C ('Mediating neuronal to muscle end plate communication') is incorrect as this process involves neurotransmitter release and reception, which is not indicated by the protein properties described.  Option D ('Reabsorption of glucose in the proximal kidney tubule') is incorrect as this process is mediated by active transport (specifically, secondary active transport with sodium ions), not passive diffusion.  Option E ('Transporting water in the collecting duct of the kidney') is incorrect as this process is mediated by aquaporins, which are passive channels for water, not ions.

This patient's presentation of a large, poorly-demarcated, erythematous, warm, and tender area on the leg associated with systemic signs of infection (eg, fever, chills, malaise) is consistent with cellulitis. Cellulitis, usually due to Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus, is common in older adults and individuals with certain risk factors such as trauma, surgical wounds, and lower extremity edema. Initial management of non-purulent cellulitis involves empiric antibiotic therapy. Because methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is not a common cause of non-purulent cellulitis, treatment should be directed against beta-hemolytic streptococci (and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus if purulence is present). Therefore, cefazolin or dicloxacillin (choice E) should be used. If the patient has a penicillin allergy, a first-generation cephalosporin (eg, cefazolin) or clindamycin would be appropriate.  Choice A (Prednisone): Steroids are not indicated for treatment of cellulitis. Choice B (Incision and drainage): This is the management of choice for an abscess or a large carbuncle, but not cellulitis. Choice C (Vancomycin): This antibiotic covers methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and would be a better choice if the patient had purulent cellulitis, a skin abscess, or if he were seriously ill or unstable. Choice D (Surgical debridement): This is needed for necrotizing infections, which typically occur in immunocompromised patients and are associated with severe pain, rapid progression, and systemic signs of illness. This patient has a typical presentation of cellulitis and does not have necrotizing infection.

The correct answer is 'A': Adenosine monophosphate.  Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) is a key signaling molecule that stimulates glucose production by activating the process of gluconeogenesis when the body's glucose stores are depleted. It is a product of ATP degradation, and its accumulation signals a low-energy state in the cell. This triggers the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. AMPK, in turn, stimulates glucose production and fatty acid oxidation to produce more ATP.  The other options are incorrect.   Option 'B': Acetate is a product of fatty acid oxidation but does not directly stimulate gluconeogenesis.  Option 'C': Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) is also a product of ATP degradation, but it does not directly stimulate gluconeogenesis. It is converted back into ATP to store energy for the cell.  Option 'D': Citrate is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle and signals a high-energy state in the cell, which would suppress, not stimulate, gluconeogenesis.  Option 'E': Acetyl CoA is also a product of fatty acid oxidation and an intermediate in the citric acid cycle, but it does not directly stimulate gluconeogenesis. Instead, it is used to produce ATP and other high-energy compounds.

This patient's history of HIV with a low CD4 count, recent travel to South America, and colon biopsy showing inflammatory cells and structures resembling oocysts within the cytoplasm of intestinal epithelial cells are most suggestive of infection with Cryptosporidium parvum (choice D). Cryptosporidium is a protozoan pathogen that can cause severe, life-threatening diarrhea in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with AIDS. Infection is acquired through ingestion of oocysts from fecally contaminated food or water. The oocysts release sporozoites in the small intestine, which invade the epithelial cells and reproduce. On light microscopy, the intracellular but extracytoplasmic (at the apical surface) location of the organisms is a key feature that differentiates cryptosporidiosis from other parasitic infections.  Cytomegalovirus (choice A) can cause colitis in immunocompromised patients, but it typically causes a more severe presentation (eg, high fever, severe abdominal pain) than Cryptosporidium does. In addition, CMV inclusions would be visible in endothelial and stromal cells rather than within the cytoplasm of epithelial cells.  Hepatitis A virus (choice B) can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, but does not cause inflammatory bowel disease.  Adverse effect of medication (choice C) is not likely in this case as none of the patient's medications are known to cause colitis.  Clostridioides difficile (choice E) can cause pseudomembranous colitis in patients receiving antibiotics or in immunocompromised patients. However, this patient has not been receiving antibiotics and the biopsy findings are not consistent with C difficile infection.

The correct answer is C, Decreased total serum calcium concentration.  This patient's perioral numbness, muscle spasms, and carpopedal spasm (induced by the blood pressure cuff, a positive Trousseau sign) suggest hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia can cause increased neuromuscular excitability, leading to these symptoms. The most common cause of hypocalcemia is hypoalbuminemia, as albumin binds calcium and a decrease in albumin will decrease total (but not ionized) calcium. However, this patient has a respiratory alkalosis (evidenced by her high pH and low pCO2), which can also cause hypocalcemia. Alkalosis causes albumin to bind more calcium, reducing ionized (active) calcium levels. This patient likely hyperventilated due to anxiety or exertion at the concert, causing her respiratory alkalosis and symptoms of hypocalcemia.  As for the other options:  A) Decreased cerebral blood flow is not suggested by this patient's symptoms or lab findings.  B) Increased peripheral oxygen unloading from hemoglobin would be seen with acidosis (which would shift the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the right), not alkalosis.  D) Increased serum potassium levels could cause muscle spasms, but would also be likely to cause cardiac arrhythmias and other symptoms not seen in this patient.  E) Increased serum phosphate levels can cause hypocalcemia, but this would typically be seen in renal failure or other chronic diseases not suggested by this patient's presentation.

The best next step in management is E: Urgent endoscopy. Alkali ingestions can cause esophageal and gastric injury. After the primary evaluation and stabilization of patients, the extent of injury should be determined with urgent endoscopy (within 24 hours). Unlike acid ingestions, which cause coagulative necrosis (denatures proteins and results in a firm eschar that limits tissue penetration), alkalis cause liquefactive necrosis (saponification of fats and solubilization of proteins) that allows deep tissue penetration and more extensive injury.   Option A: Close observation and outpatient endoscopy in 2 to 3 weeks is not the best approach. Alkali ingestions can lead to severe damage and this needs to be assessed urgently, not in 2 to 3 weeks' time.  Option B: Inducing emesis can cause further damage to the esophagus and is not recommended. It can also increase the risk of aspiration.  Option C: A nasogastric tube is generally not recommended unless there is a clear indication such as gastrointestinal obstruction. Insertion of a nasogastric tube can be challenging and potentially dangerous in this clinical context.  Option D: Titration of the alkali ingestion with a weak acid is not a recommended treatment for bleach ingestion. It could potentially lead to an exothermic reaction and cause more harm. The goal of management after an alkali ingestion is to evaluate and manage the extent of injury, not to chemically neutralize the alkali.

The patient most likely has hemophilia A due to a mutation in factor VIII (option E). Hemophilia A is a X-linked recessive disorder characterized by deficiency or dysfunction of factor VIII. This leads to defective intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade, resulting in increased PTT. The fact that this patient is a male, his family history of bleeding disorders, and his lifelong history of frequent nosebleeds, are all indicative of a hereditary coagulation factor disorder like hemophilia. The factor mixing study, which corrects the prolonged PTT, indicates that the patient's plasma lacks a certain factor (as opposed to the presence of an inhibitor, which would not correct with a mixing study).  Option A is incorrect because activation of inhibitory factors would not result in a corrected PTT upon mixing.   Option B is incorrect because antibodies to factor VIII would not result in a corrected PTT upon mixing. This is seen in acquired hemophilia, which is extremely rare and usually occurs in elderly patients or postpartum.  Option C is incorrect because inhibition of a reductase enzyme is related to the mechanism of action of warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, which primarily increases prothrombin time, not PTT.   Option D is also incorrect because a mutation in a carrier protein would not explain his history and laboratory findings. An example of this is Hemophilia B (Christmas disease) due to mutation in factor IX, which would also present with increased PTT and correct with a mixing study, but it is less common than Hemophilia A.

Based on the history given, the most likely diagnosis for this 7-year-old boy is transient synovitis of the hip, also known as "irritable hip." The underlying mechanism is immune-mediated synovial inflammation, which makes answer 'D' the correct one.  Transient synovitis often follows a viral illness, such as the runny nose and fever the boy had a month prior. Typical symptoms include limping and hip pain that is worse with activity. Physical examination often reveals tenderness in the groin and decreased range of motion of the hip due to pain.  Options 'A' and 'E' refer to conditions such as slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) and Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, respectively. SCFE typically presents in adolescents who are overweight with chronic, dull hip or knee pain, and is not usually associated with a recent viral illness. Legg-Calve-Perthes disease commonly presents in boys aged 4-8 who have chronic hip pain, but it is often associated with additional symptoms such as limping for several months, decreased hip mobility, and thigh muscle wasting.  Option 'B', bacterial infection of the joint, also known as septic arthritis, is a serious condition that typically presents with acute onset of severe pain, inability to bear weight, fever, and elevated inflammatory markers. This boy's mild symptoms and normal vital signs make this diagnosis unlikely.  Option 'C', viral infection, is not the correct answer because although transient synovitis is often preceded by a viral infection, the underlying mechanism of the disease is immune-mediated inflammation, not active viral infection.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is Acute Hepatitis B infection (option B).   The patient's symptoms of fatigue, fever, abdominal pain, and nausea, in addition to physical signs such as scleral icterus and liver tenderness, are indicative of acute hepatitis. The laboratory findings including elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes (AST and ALT) further support this diagnosis.   In terms of hepatitis B serologies, the presence of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and Hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBeAg) signifies an active infection. The presence of Hepatitis B core IgG antibody (anti-HBc) indicates that the immune system is responding to the infection.  Now, why the other options are wrong:  Option A, Inactive chronic hepatitis B infection, is incorrect because this would present with normal liver enzymes and the absence of HBeAg.  Option C, Active chronic hepatitis B infection, is incorrect because chronic infection is diagnosed after 6 months of persistence of HBsAg. The patient has been symptomatic for only 3 weeks.  Option D, Resolved acute Hepatitis B infection, is incorrect because it requires a negative HBsAg and a positive anti-HBs (surface antibody). This patient has a positive HBsAg and no mention of anti-HBs status is made.  Option E, Alcoholic hepatitis, is incorrect because although the patient does drink alcohol, her quantity is not usually associated with alcoholic hepatitis. Additionally, her hepatitis B serologies very clearly indicate an acute hepatitis B infection.

This patient's chronic symmetric polyarthritis (inflammation of many joints) with morning stiffness lasting more than an hour and the presence of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies is suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).  Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder that primarily involves the synovial joints. The pathogenesis of RA is a result of both type III and type IV hypersensitivity reactions. Thus, the answer is B: 'Both type II and III hypersensitivities'.  In the early stages of the disease, immune complexes (antigen-antibody) deposit on the synovial membrane leading to the activation of complement and recruitment of inflammatory cells, which is characteristic of type III hypersensitivity reactions. As the disease progresses, T cells (type IV hypersensitivity) become involved and are responsible for the ongoing chronic inflammation in the synovium.  Option A: 'Self-tolerance' is not correct because it is a normal process that prevents the immune system from attacking its own tissues. In autoimmune diseases like RA, self-tolerance is lost, but it's not an immune-mediated injury itself.  Option C: 'IgE-mediated immune responses only' is not correct because it represents type I hypersensitivity reactions, which are not implicated in the pathophysiology of RA.  Option D: 'Type IV hypersensitivity' is partially correct because it is involved in RA but not the only type of hypersensitivity reaction that contributes to the disease.  Option E: 'Type III hypersensitivity' is also only partially correct, as explained above.

The best next step for this patient is option A: Routine screening: repeat Pap test every 3 years.   The management of abnormal Pap smear results depends on the specific cytologic abnormality detected as well as the patient's age and HPV status. For women aged 21-29 years, HPV cotesting is not recommended, so the next step after a Pap smear showing atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) is repeat cytology in one year. For women aged 30 years and older, HPV cotesting is recommended. An ASC-US result with negative HPV test in this age group is managed with routine screening because the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or 3 is very low.  Option B: Colposcopy and option C: Cervical biopsy are not necessary in this case because the HPV test was negative. Colposcopy or biopsy is typically indicated for ASC-US if the HPV test is positive, or for more significant cytologic abnormalities.  Option D: Repeat cytology and HPV testing in 3 years is not correct because, according to current guidelines, after an ASC-US Pap smear with a negative HPV test, the patient can return to routine screening every 3 years, not repeat cytology and HPV testing.  Option E: Excisional treatment is not indicated because this is a treatment for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2-3), not for ASC-US with a negative HPV test.

The most appropriate next step in this patient's management is Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (choice D). This patient has chronic alcoholism and presents with acute right upper quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis, which suggest acute cholecystitis. On abdominal ultrasound, the presence of gallstones, gallbladder wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid further support this diagnosis. Acute cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder due to gallstone impaction in the cystic duct. The initial treatment consists of fluid resuscitation, analgesia, and antibiotics. Early cholecystectomy (within 72-96 hours) is the definitive treatment and is recommended in patients without serious comorbidities.   Option A: Oral Rifaximin and lactulose are used for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy, which is not present in this patient.  Option B: Intravenous vitamin K is used to correct coagulopathies, particularly in patients with liver disease. This patient's INR is slightly elevated, suggesting some degree of liver dysfunction, but it is not significantly abnormal and she does not have any bleeding or bruising to suggest a coagulopathy requiring correction.  Option C: Abdominal paracentesis is typically performed for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes in patients with ascites, usually due to cirrhosis. This patient has signs of ascites (shifting dullness), but the current acute illness is likely cholecystitis, not ascites or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.  Option E: Open cholecystectomy is typically reserved for patients in whom a laparoscopic approach is contraindicated, such as those with severe adhesions from previous surgeries or inability to tolerate pneumoperitoneum due to compromised cardiopulmonary function. There's no indication given that this patient would be unable to tolerate laparoscopic surgery.

This patient's diaphoresis, epigastric discomfort, and dyspnea are suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). ACS can present with typical chest pain (substernal chest discomfort with possible radiation to the neck, jaw, shoulders, or arms) or with atypical symptoms including epigastric pain, nausea, unexplained dyspnea, or diaphoresis. The degree of myocardial oxygen demand/supply imbalance determines the clinical presentation; those with a greater imbalance are more likely to experience chest pain, whereas those with less severe ischemia may experience dyspnea or other atypical symptoms.   Given the patient's ACS, the most appropriate next step is administration of sublingual nitroglycerin (Option C). Nitroglycerin is a potent venous and arterial vasodilator that reduces myocardial oxygen demand by decreasing preload and afterload. It also dilates coronary arteries and improves collateral blood flow to ischemic areas.  Intravenous atropine (Option A) is used in the acute setting of symptomatic bradycardia, which this patient does not have.   Intravenous morphine (Option B) is typically used in ACS to relieve chest pain and anxiety when not relieved by nitroglycerin.   Phenylephrine infusion (Option D) is a vasopressor used in conditions associated with hypotension and low systemic vascular resistance, such as septic shock, and is inappropriate in this case.  Normal saline bolus (Option E) is typically used in hypovolemic conditions, which this patient does not have.

The best next step in this case is 'E: Emergency laparotomy'. This patient has signs of hypovolemic shock (tachycardia, hypotension, cool skin) secondary to suspected intra-abdominal bleeding from her motor vehicle accident (diffuse abdominal bruising, tenderness). The FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma) exam is useful for detecting free fluid (eg, blood) in the peritoneal or pericardial space in trauma patients. However, in this patient, the FAST exam is equivocal and she is persistently hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation, which suggests ongoing blood loss. Therefore, she requires emergent laparotomy for hemorrhage control and to prevent further hemodynamic instability and death.  Option 'A: Chest Radiograph' would be beneficial if there was a suspicion of thoracic injury (eg, pneumothorax, hemothorax) leading to shock, but her physical examination is unremarkable in that respect.  Option 'B: Abdominal CT' is the most accurate test for diagnosing intra-abdominal injury but is not appropriate in hemodynamically unstable patients due to the time it takes to perform the test and the risk of transportation.  Option 'C: Diagnostic peritoneal lavage' is an older modality that has largely been replaced by the FAST exam and CT scanning for the detection of intra-abdominal injury.  Option 'D: Diagnostic laparoscopy' is not typically used in the acute trauma setting because it requires general anesthesia and specialized equipment and personnel, and has a narrow field of view.

The correct answer is B: 'â â â â'  Hyperphosphatemia stimulates secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which in turn increases phosphate excretion in the urine, leading to a decrease in serum total calcium and calcitriol.  PTH is primarily regulated by serum calcium levels, but it is also sensitive to changes in serum phosphate. An increase in serum phosphate stimulates PTH secretion, which in turn increases the renal excretion of phosphate. This is the body's primary mechanism for preventing hyperphosphatemia.  High levels of PTH also increase the conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) in the kidney. Calcitriol increases intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate.  However, in this case of hyperphosphatemia, the high phosphate levels would cause a decline in calcitriol synthesis as a feedback mechanism to prevent further increase in phosphate levels. Also, PTH would promote calcium reabsorption in the kidney and bone resorption, to increase serum calcium levels. Despite these compensatory actions, the initial effect of phosphate load may cause serum total calcium to decrease due to formation of calcium-phosphate product.  The other options are incorrect mainly because they do not account for the body's compensatory mechanisms in response to hyperphosphatemia. For example, any option suggesting a decrease in PTH is incorrect because PTH levels would increase in response to high phosphate levels. Also, any option suggesting an increase in serum total calcium or calcitriol is incorrect because these would decrease as a result of the phosphate infusion.

The correct answer is A: Cefadroxil.  This patient's fever, cough, rhonchi, increased tactile fremitus, and imaging findings of lobar consolidation are indicative of community-acquired pneumonia. The most common pathogens in children aged 5-15 are Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, this child's blood, nasopharynx, and sputum cultures are positive for Moraxella catarrhalis, a gram-negative diplococcus. M catarrhalis is a common cause of otitis media, sinusitis, and occasionally pneumonia in children. The right ear pain and erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane suggest concurrent acute otitis media.  Cefadroxil (Option A) and Cephalexin (Option B) are first-generation cephalosporins, which are effective against gram-positive cocci and some gram-negative bacilli. M catarrhalis, in particular, is almost universally susceptible to most cephalosporins. Although both options A and B would be appropriate for treatment, Cefadroxil is preferred as it can be given once daily compared to Cephalexin which usually needs to be given two to four times daily.  Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Option E) would be a poor choice because M catarrhalis is typically resistant to it. Additionally, Doxycycline (Option C) is not typically used for respiratory infections in children under 8 because it can cause permanent discoloration of teeth. Linezolid (Option D) is a more powerful antibiotic typically reserved for serious gram-positive infections, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE). This child's presentation does not suggest such a severe infection, so the use of Linezolid would not be appropriate.

The correct answer is A. Carbidopa.  The patient's history of Parkinson disease with increasing bradykinesia and tremor before his next levodopa dose and "on-off" phenomenon (eg, sudden, temporary freezing) suggests progression of his disease and development of levodopa-related motor complications. Levodopa, the most effective drug for Parkinson disease, is typically coadministered with carbidopa, a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor. Carbidopa decreases the peripheral metabolism of levodopa to dopamine, thereby increasing the bioavailability of levodopa to cross the blood-brain barrier. This allows for lower doses of levodopa to be used, decreasing the risk of side effects.  The other choices are: - Entacapone (option B) is a catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor that decreases the peripheral metabolism of levodopa, but it works by inhibiting methylation, not decarboxylation. - Ropinirole (option C) is a dopamine agonist used in Parkinson disease that acts directly on the dopamine receptors. It does not increase the bioavailability of levodopa. - Amantadine (option D) is an antiviral medication that also has anti-Parkinson properties by increasing dopamine release, decreasing dopamine reuptake, and blocking glutamate neurotransmission. It does not increase the bioavailability of levodopa. - Rasagiline (option E) is a monoamine oxidase type B inhibitor that decreases the metabolism of dopamine in the brain, prolonging the effects of levodopa. It does not increase the bioavailability of levodopa.

The clinical picture is suggestive of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), a potentially lethal complication of chemotherapy, especially in patients with hematologic malignancies that have a high proliferative rate, large tumor burden, or high sensitivity to cytotoxic agents. TLS is characterized by rapid lysis of malignant cells leading to the release of intracellular contents into the systemic circulation. This leads to hyperuricemia due to the breakdown of nucleic acids, hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia due to cell lysis, and secondary hypocalcemia due to precipitation of calcium with phosphate. Additionally, uric acid can precipitate in the renal tubules leading to acute kidney injury, as suggested by nausea, vomiting, oliguria, and edema in this patient.  Option B (Hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, urine supernatant pink, and positive for heme) is the correct answer. The urine supernatant being pink is due to the presence of uric acid. Urine might also be positive for heme due to tubular injury.  Option A, C, D, and E are incorrect for the following reasons:  Option A: Creatine kinase (MM) elevation is not typically associated with tumor lysis syndrome.  Option C: Urate crystals in the urine could potentially be seen in TLS, but lactic acidosis is not a typical feature of the syndrome.  Option D: A urinary monoclonal spike is seen in conditions like multiple myeloma, not typically in TLS.  Option E: Oxalate crystals are seen in conditions like ethylene glycol poisoning, not typically in TLS.

The correct answer is C: External cephalic version.  At 32 weeks gestation, it's not uncommon for the fetus to change its positioning. However, by 36 weeks, most fetuses should have moved into the head-down (cephalic) position in preparation for a vaginal delivery. If the fetus is in a transverse or breech position at this time, an external cephalic version (ECV) is typically recommended. ECV involves the healthcare provider applying pressure to the mother's abdomen in order to manually turn the fetus into the head-down position. This procedure is successful about 50% of the time and can allow the woman to have a vaginal delivery, thereby avoiding a caesarean section.  Option 'A' is incorrect because expectant management simply involves waiting and monitoring, which could lead to an emergency situation if the fetus does not move into the correct position by the time of delivery.   Option 'B' is incorrect because weekly ultrasounds would only monitor the situation but not actively address the problem of the fetus being in the transverse position.  Option 'D' is incorrect because internal cephalic version is not typically done due to the high risk of complications, including fetal distress, cord prolapse, or placental abruption.  Option 'E' is incorrect because while a caesarean section may eventually be necessary if the fetus does not move into the correct position, it would not be the first choice of management as the patient has expressed a preference for vaginal delivery and there is still time for the fetus to turn.

This patient's pruritic serpiginous rash and recent exposure to sheep protein (via antivenom) suggest an urticarial rash due to serum sickness. Serum sickness is a type III hypersensitivity reaction, in which immune complexes form and deposit in tissues, triggering inflammation and clinical symptoms. Fab antivenom is less likely to cause serum sickness than whole IgG antivenom (used in the past), but the risk is not zero. Serum sickness often presents 1-2 weeks after exposure to the antigen, but can occur within a few days. Clinical features include fever, pruritic rash, arthralgias, and, less commonly, lymphadenopathy and proteinuria. The rash often begins on the trunk or upper extremities and can be urticarial or morbilliform; it can also be vasculitic, with palpable purpura. The treatment is supportive, with antihistamines for pruritus and NSAIDs for arthralgias. Glucocorticoids can be used in severe cases.   Option A, Dialysis , is not indicated as there is no evidence of renal failure. Option B, Glucocorticoid taper with antihistamines, might be used in severe cases, but there is no indication for glucocorticoids at this point.  Option C, Antihistamines, is the correct answer for the management of pruritus associated with the rash. Option D, NSAIDs, might be used for arthralgias but not as the next best step in this case. Option E, Plasmapheresis, is not indicated as it is typically reserved for severe cases of serum sickness that do not respond to usual treatment.

This patient's presentation of acute onset severe, constant, epigastric pain radiating to the back, with associated nausea and vomiting, in the setting of alcohol consumption is classic for acute pancreatitis. The diagnosis is confirmed with the elevation in serum lipase. Acute pancreatitis often presents with nonspecific physical examination findings, including tenderness and guarding, as seen in this patient. Although the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is clinical and does not necessarily require imaging for confirmation, contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan (Choice A) is the most appropriate next step in management if the patient does not improve within the first 48-72 hours, there is uncertainty about the diagnosis, or if there is concern for complications (eg, necrosis, pseudocyst, abscess).   Right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound (Choice B) is used to look for gallstones, which along with alcohol, is the most common cause of acute pancreatitis. However, this patient's history of alcohol consumption gives a clear etiology, making ultrasound less useful in the acute setting. Plain x-ray of the abdomen (Choice C) can be useful in assessing for perforated viscus, bowel obstruction, or certain causes of acute abdominal pain (eg, kidney stone, gallstone) but is not typically helpful in the setting of pancreatitis. Serum triglycerides (Choice D) should be measured to evaluate for hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis if no cause is evident after assessing for gallstones and alcohol use. However, this patient's history of alcohol use provides an obvious cause. Blood alcohol level assay (Choice E) does not impact the immediate management or prognosis of acute pancreatitis.

The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient would be E: Oral Vitamin B12 supplementation.   This patient is presenting with fatigue, difficulty concentrating, pallor, and a normocytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume 80-100 µm3) with low reticulocyte count (<3%), which suggest anemia due to inadequate production. She also has a history of Crohn disease, which commonly involves the terminal ileum. In addition to causing diarrhea, terminal ileal involvement can lead to vitamin B12 deficiency because the terminal ileum is the primary site for B12 absorption. Vitamin B12 deficiency causes ineffective erythropoiesis and pancytopenia, with macrocytosis typically seen on peripheral smear. However, up to 25% of patients with B12 deficiency present with a normal or low mean corpuscular volume due to concurrent iron deficiency or thalassemia trait, as in this patient.  The other options are not appropriate. Option A: Oral prednisone therapy is not indicated as there is no sign of active inflammation. Option B: Subcutaneous erythropoietin injection is used in anemia secondary to chronic kidney disease, not B12 deficiency anemia. Option C: Red blood cell transfusion would be appropriate if the patient was severely symptomatic or hemodynamically unstable from the anemia, which this patient is not. Option D: Intravenous metronidazole therapy is not indicated as there is no sign of bacterial infection or abscess.

The answer is A: Microtubule.  The staining pattern described in the question is due to the presence of Nissl bodies, which are structures located within the soma and dendrites, but not the axons, of neurons. Nissl bodies are composed of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and are involved in protein synthesis. Aniline stains are used to visualize Nissl bodies.  Even though Nissl bodies are essentially RER, the question specifically asks for the cellular element that explains the absence of staining in the axons. This is because microtubules are responsible for transporting substances (including those synthesized by the RER) from the soma to the axon. However, since axons lack RER (and therefore Nissl bodies), they do not stain with aniline.   Nucleus (option B) is present in the soma of the neuron, but its presence or absence does not explain the staining pattern. Lysosomes (option C) are involved in digestion of cellular waste and are present throughout the neuron, but again, their presence or absence does not explain the staining pattern. The Golgi apparatus (option D) is involved in packaging and shipping proteins, but it also does not specifically explain the staining pattern. Finally, as mentioned before, even though RER (option E) essentially makes up Nissl bodies, it is the lack of microtubules in the axon that explains why axons do not stain with aniline.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is 'D': Acute Glomerulonephritis.   The patient is presenting with a history of gross hematuria that is episodic and seems to be triggered by infections, which is characteristic of acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN). APSGN is an immune-mediated disorder that often occurs 1-2 weeks after a group A Streptococcus infection of the throat or skin and is associated with hematuria, hypertension, edema, and renal insufficiency. Although APSGN is the most common cause of acute nephritis in children, it can occur at any age. It is also noteworthy that APSGN can be a familial disease, which is suggested by the fact that the patient's father has experienced similar symptoms.  Option 'A': Acute Cystitis, typically presents with dysuria, urgency, frequency, and suprapubic pain rather than hematuria.  Option 'B': Acute Interstitial Nephritis, often presents with fever, rash, and eosinophilia, and it is typically associated with medication use.  Option 'C': Sickle Cell Trait, can cause hematuria, but it would not be associated with infection.  Option 'E': Hemophilia, is a bleeding disorder that would not typically present solely with hematuria. Hematuria can occur in hemophilia but it is usually associated with trauma and this patient's presentation is more consistent with APSGN.

Answer: C 'Working too many hours'  The physician is likely experiencing burnout, which is a long-term stress reaction marked by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a lack of sense of personal accomplishment. A contributing factor to burnout is working too many hours (choice C). He is spending a significant amount of time visiting patients (about 51 hours per week seeing 20 patients a day). This amount of work without adequate rest and recovery could lead to physical and emotional exhaustion.  Choice A (The number of patients on his panel) is not likely the primary contributor. Although a high number of patients could contribute to stress, it's the amount of time spent working (regardless of the number of patients) that is a more significant factor in burnout.  Choice B (Excessive bureaucratic tasks) could also contribute to burnout but there is no information provided in the question stem suggesting this is a primary concern for this doctor.  Choice D (Concern over online reputation) could certainly add stress, but the question doesn't give any indication that this is the major stressor for the doctor. Moreover, it's more likely that the negative reviews are an effect of the doctor's burnout, rather than the cause.  Choice E (The number of geriatric patients on his panel) is unlikely to be the main issue. While geriatric patients may have more complex needs, there's no specific information in the question suggesting that this is the primary stressor for this doctor.   Therefore, 'working too many hours' is the most likely contributor to this physician's burnout.

The correct answer is B: 'Rx: Weight loss, CC: Infertility and insulin resistance.'  This patient's findings of hirsutism, obesity, menstrual irregularities, and likely polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) suggest a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age, PCOS is characterized by hyperandrogenism (manifesting as hirsutism and acne), chronic anovulation (manifesting as menstrual irregularities), and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound.  First-line treatment for PCOS is weight loss, which can help normalize menstrual cycles and improve hirsutism and insulin sensitivity. This option is preferred over combined oral contraceptives as the initial therapy, which are a second-line treatment used if lifestyle modifications are unsuccessful or if a rapid response is needed (eg, severe hyperandrogenism).  Insulin resistance is a key pathophysiologic feature of PCOS, increasing the risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, patients with PCOS should undergo screening for insulin resistance. PCOS is also associated with an increased prevalence of infertility due to chronic anovulation.  Other options are incorrect because combined oral contraceptives are not the first-line treatment for PCOS, and while lipid dysfunction can be associated with PCOS, the primary comorbid conditions to be tested for are infertility and insulin resistance.

The correct answer is E. Administer iron intravenously.  This patient with daily alcohol use has a microcytic anemia with thrombocytosis. In patients with chronic alcoholism, the most common hematologic abnormalities include macrocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and occasionally, pancytopenia due to bone marrow suppression. However, in a patient with microcytic anemia, it is more likely to be secondary to iron deficiency which can occur from various causes including malnutrition, malabsorption, and gastrointestinal blood loss. Importantly, alcohol-induced gastrointestinal blood loss is common and can be insidious. In such cases, oral iron replacement can be inadequate due to ongoing blood loss or poor absorption. Hence, intravenous iron supplementation (Option E) would be the most appropriate next step when oral iron therapy fails.  Option A: Transfusion of whole blood is unnecessary at this point as her hemoglobin level is not critically low.  Option B: Supplementing with ascorbic acid can enhance iron absorption, but in the face of alcohol-induced gastrointestinal losses or malabsorption, it may not be sufficient.  Option C: Omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, reduces gastric acid production and can further impair iron absorption making it a poor choice.  Option D: Administering folate would not address the microcytic anemia and thrombocytosis seen in this patient. Folate deficiency typically presents as macrocytic anemia.

The most appropriate recommendation at this time would be the influenza vaccine (Option C). As per current recommendations, an annual influenza vaccine is indicated for all individuals aged =6 months, including the elderly and those with chronic medical conditions. The patient's last influenza vaccine was 2 years ago, and hence it is now due.  Explanation for other options:  Option A: Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) screening is recommended every 2 years for women aged =65 years or for younger postmenopausal women at increased risk for osteoporosis. This patient has no risk factors such as smoking, low body weight or family history of osteoporosis.  Option B: A colonoscopy should be performed every 10 years starting at age 50 in average-risk individuals. Given that her last colonoscopy was 5 years ago and was normal, she does not need another one at this time.  Option D: Tetanus vaccine is typically given as part of the Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis) vaccine, which is recommended every 10 years. Her last tetanus booster was only 6 years ago, so she is not due for another yet.  Option E: Shingles vaccine is recommended for adults aged = 60 years. However, given the time of the year (June), the more urgent vaccine is the influenza vaccine. The shingles vaccine is not seasonally dependent and can be given any time of the year, so it can be administered at a later visit.

The correct answer is D: Thyroglossal duct cyst.  This patient's echocardiography findings of a right-to-left shunt through the atrial septum during a Valsalva maneuver (eg, coughing) are consistent with a patent foramen ovale (PFO). A PFO is a common congenital heart defect that results from failure of the foramen ovale to close after birth. The foramen ovale normally allows right-to-left shunting in utero to bypass the nonfunctional fetal lungs. After birth, increased pulmonary blood flow and decreased right atrial pressure facilitate its closure. If this process fails, the foramen ovale remains patent and may only become evident if a transient increase in right atrial pressure (eg, due to coughing, straining) results in a right-to-left shunt.   Thyroglossal duct cysts are a result of the failure of the thyroglossal duct to involute during embryological development, similar to the failure of the foramen ovale to close in PFO.  The other options are incorrect because they are caused by different embryologic failures.   Midgut volvulus (Option A) occurs due to an abnormal rotation of the midgut during embryonic development.  Transposition of the great vessels (Option B) is a cyanotic congenital heart defect caused by failure of the aorticopulmonary septum to spiral correctly.  Hirschsprung disease (Option C) results from a failure of neural crest cell migration during embryologic development.  Hypospadias (Option E) is a disorder of male urethral development caused by the failure of the urethral folds to close.

The most appropriate next step in this 45-year-old woman with dyspepsia (ie, epigastric discomfort) and no alarm symptoms (eg, weight loss, anemia, dysphagia, persistent vomiting, family history of upper gastrointestinal cancers, evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding) is a trial of empiric therapy with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) (Choice B). PPIs suppress gastric acid secretion and can help symptoms of both gastroesophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcer disease. If symptoms do not improve after 4-8 weeks of PPI therapy, further diagnostic evaluation (eg, endoscopy) is warranted.   Urease breath test (Choice A) is a noninvasive test used to diagnose Helicobacter pylori infection. However, the test is not typically performed in patients with dyspepsia unless they are about to undergo endoscopy or have failed initial PPI therapy.  Upper endoscopy (Choice C) is the most sensitive test for diagnosing peptic ulcer disease and gastroesophageal reflux disease. However, in the absence of alarm symptoms or nonresponse to empiric PPI therapy, it is typically not the initial test in patients <60 years.  Esophageal pH monitoring (Choice D) is the best test for establishing a definitive diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease but is usually reserved for patients with atypical presentations or for those considering surgical intervention.  Barium swallow (Choice E) is useful for evaluating structural abnormalities (eg, tumors, strictures, diverticula) and esophageal motility disorders (eg, achalasia). It is not typically first-line for evaluation of dyspepsia.

The correct answer is A: Dorsal wings of the third branchial pouch.  The patient's elevated parathyroid hormone and serum calcium levels, along with the localization of disease to an area near the superior aspect of the thyroid in the right neck, suggest the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism due to a parathyroid adenoma. The parathyroid glands develop from the third and fourth branchial pouches. The superior parathyroid glands originate from the dorsal wings of the fourth branchial pouch and usually descend with the thyroid gland to a position at the cricoid cartilage level. However, the superior parathyroid glands sometimes descend less than expected and can be found at the level of the hyoid bone or even higher, within the thyroid gland itself. The inferior parathyroid glands arise from the third branchial pouch and typically are located at or below the inferior thyroid artery.  Options B, C, D, and E are incorrect as they do not correctly describe the embryologic origin of the superior parathyroid glands. Option B refers to the fourth branchial arch, which gives rise to the superior parathyroid glands. Option C refers to the fourth branchial pouch, which also gives rise to the superior parathyroid glands. Option D refers to the third branchial arch, which gives rise to the inferior parathyroid glands. Option E refers to the ventral wings of the third branchial pouch, which give rise to the thymus.

The correct answer is B. Gram-negative, oxidase-positive bacillus.   This patient's ascending muscle weakness and reduced deep tendon reflexes suggest Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). GBS is an autoimmune condition that often follows a gastrointestinal or respiratory infection. The most common causative organism of the preceding infection is Campylobacter jejuni, a gram-negative, oxidase-positive bacillus. In GBS, it is believed that shared epitopes between the infectious agent and components of the peripheral nerve lead to an autoimmune response. Initially, patients may report paresthesias in the hands and feet, followed by proximal muscle weakness that peaks in severity in 4 weeks. Autonomic dysfunction, such as labile blood pressure and cardiac arrhythmias, can also occur. GBS is a diagnosis of exclusion in a patient who presents with progressive, ascending paralysis.  The other options describe the characteristics of different bacteria that do not typically precede GBS: A) Gram-positive bacillus is broad and could refer to many bacteria, but none are typically associated with GBS. C) Gram-negative, oxidase-positive, comma-shaped bacteria describes Vibrio cholerae, not typically associated with GBS. D) Gram-negative, oxidase-negative, bacillus with hydrogen sulfide gas production describes Salmonella, not typically associated with GBS. E) Gram-negative, oxidase-negative, bacillus without hydrogen sulfide gas production describes E. coli, not typically associated with GBS.

The best answer is A: Prolongation of chloride channel opening.  This patient's presentation of a prolonged seizure (>5 minutes) is consistent with status epilepticus, a neurological emergency that requires immediate treatment to prevent long-term neuronal injury. First-line treatment for status epilepticus is benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam, diazepam), which enhance Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity by prolonging the duration of chloride channel openings. This results in hyperpolarization of the neuron and decreased ability to reach the threshold potential necessary for action potential propagation.  Option B (Increase in frequency of chloride channel opening) is incorrect because this is the mechanism of action for barbiturates such as phenobarbital, not benzodiazepines.  Option C (Blockage of voltage-gated calcium channels) is incorrect because this is the mechanism of action for drugs like gabapentin and pregabalin. These drugs are used primarily for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia, and as adjuncts in epilepsy, not for acute management of status epilepticus.  Option D (Inactivation of sodium channels) is incorrect because this mechanism is seen with drugs like phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproate. These drugs are used for long-term management of seizures, not for acute management of status epilepticus.  Option E (Blockage of T-type calcium) is incorrect because this is the mechanism of action of ethosuximide, a drug used specifically for absence seizures.

The correct answer is A, 'Family income appears to be a confounder.'  A confounder is a variable that influences both the dependent variable and independent variable, causing a false association. In this case, family income appears to be a confounder since it affects both the vaccination campaign (independent variable) and the uptake of HPV vaccine (dependent variable).  Option B is incorrect because an effect modifier changes the magnitude of the effect of the exposure on the outcome, depending on its level. In this case, family income does not modify the effect of the campaign on the vaccine uptake; rather, it's associated with the likelihood of vaccine uptake regardless of the campaign.  Option C is incorrect because the vaccination campaign was effective. The children in the chosen counties were 3 times more likely to receive the HPV vaccine compared to those in counties where no campaign was instituted.  Option D is incorrect because the vaccine uptake is the outcome (dependent variable) of the study, not the exposure (independent variable).  Option E is incorrect because the vaccination campaign is the exposure (independent variable), not the outcome (dependent variable) of the study. Family income, which affects the likelihood of vaccine uptake, is a confounding factor, not part of the study outcome.

The correct answer is A: 'Vaccinate: 2 weeks prior to surgery; Penicillin: 2 weeks prior to surgery for an indefinite course'  Patients undergoing splenectomy are at increased risk of infection by encapsulated organisms like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae. Therefore, it is recommended to vaccinate these patients against these organisms at least two weeks prior to the surgery to allow for adequate development of protective immunity.  The appropriate timing of antibiotic prophylaxis with penicillin for these patients is less clearly defined, but it is generally started around the time of surgery. It is typically continued indefinitely in patients who have had a splenectomy, especially those older than age 50 or who have had their spleen removed due to a hematologic malignancy or other disorder (like ITP) that affects the immune system.   The other options are incorrect because they do not align with these recommendations. Options B and C propose starting penicillin prophylaxis at the time of surgery â this would be too late to provide adequate protection. Option C also proposes to stop penicillin prophylaxis after 5 years, which is not recommended for this patient due to her age and underlying immune disorder. Options D and E propose vaccinating at the time of surgery â this would not allow for adequate development of protective immunity.   Remember, this a guide and individual patient's management may vary as per patient's state and physician's clinical judgement.

This patient's unresponsiveness, tachycardia, and elevated serum osmolality are concerning for hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS, option D), a complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus often precipitated by infection, medications, noncompliance, or a new diagnosis of diabetes. HHS is characterized by severe hyperglycemia (>600 mg/dL), hyperosmolality (>320 mOsm/kg), and dehydration in the absence of significant ketoacidosis. The profound dehydration is a result of the severe hyperglycemia leading to glycosuria, osmotic diuresis, and eventually hypovolemia. Neurologic findings (eg, seizures, hemiparesis, coma) due to the increased serum osmolality are often present and can be the presenting symptom in undiagnosed diabetes.  In contrast, diabetic ketoacidosis (option C) presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting due to the acidosis. Kussmaul respirations may also be present. Patients are often acutely ill but do not have the neurologic findings seen in HHS. Central diabetes insipidus (option B) would present with polyuria, polydipsia, and hypernatremia but not unconsciousness or tachycardia. Acute ethanol intoxication (option A) typically presents with disinhibition, ataxia, and, potentially, coma, but serum osmolality remains normal. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (option E) causes hyponatremia, not hypernatremia.

This woman's presentation of bilateral breast fullness, tenderness, and warmth is consistent with lactational mastitis. This condition is typically seen in post-partum women, especially those who are breastfeeding. However, lactational mastitis can also occur in women who are not breastfeeding, as is the case with this patient. The breast becomes engorged with milk that is not being expressed, leading to inflammation and mastitis. This is also known as "milk stasis." The best way to treat this condition is to express the milk, which will relieve the engorgement and inflammation. Therefore, the best next step in management for this patient is breast pumping (Option 'A').  As for the other options, breastfeeding (Option 'B') could potentially alleviate the symptoms, but the patient has already chosen to feed her baby with formula. It would be inappropriate to ask the patient to change her feeding method. Oxacillin (Option 'C') and Vancomycin (Option 'E') are antibiotics and would be appropriate if the patient had an infection, but there is no indication of that in the case presented. The patient's symptoms are consistent with milk stasis, not infection. Finally, an ultrasound (Option 'D') could potentially be useful for diagnosing other breast conditions, but it is not necessary in this case because the patient's symptoms and history are strongly suggestive of lactational mastitis.
