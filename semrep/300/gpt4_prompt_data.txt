USMLE question: A researcher is studying the properties of an enzyme that adds phosphate groups to glucose.

USMLE question: A scientist is studying a protein that is present on the plasma membrane of cells. He therefore purifies the protein in a lipid bilayer and subjects it to a number of conditions.
