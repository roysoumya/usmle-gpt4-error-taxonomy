606,"The correct answer is 'D': Testicular cancer.

The drug being described is a microtubule inhibitor, such as colchicine or paclitaxel. These drugs interfere with the formation of the mitotic spindle during cell division, preventing the chromosomes from aligning at the metaphase plate and thus halting the cell in metaphase. This is a common technique used in karyotyping, as it allows for better visualization of the chromosomes under a microscope.

Paclitaxel is a chemotherapy drug used to treat a variety of cancers, including testicular cancer. It works by stabilizing the microtubules so that they cannot break down, which prevents the cell from completing mitosis and dividing.

294,"This patient's symptoms of progressive dyspnea, wheezing, nonproductive cough, and a significant smoking history, along with the findings of hypercapnia and hypoxemia on arterial blood gas analysis, are suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), most likely due to emphysema. 

Option 'B', 'Decreased diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO)', is the correct answer. The diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is a measure of the lung's ability to transfer gas from air in the lung, across the alveolocapillary membrane, to the red blood cells in pulmonary capillaries. In emphysema, destruction of alveolar walls results in a loss of alveolar capillary units, leading to a decreased DLCO.

Now, let's discuss why the other options are not correct:

'A': 'Decreased lung residual volume': In emphysema, due to loss of elastic recoil and airway collapse during expiration, there is air trapping which results in an increased, not decreased, residual volume.

'C': 'Increased FEV1/FVC ratio': In obstructive lung diseases like emphysema, the FEV1/FVC ratio is usually decreased, not increased, due to airflow limitation and prolonged forced expiratory time.

'D': 'Shift of the flow volume loop to the right': In emphysema, the flow volume loop is shifted to the left (not right) due to increased lung volumes.

'E': 'Decreased lung compliance': In emphysema, the destruction of alveolar walls results in loss of elastic recoil, leading to increased, not decreased, lung compliance.","stop","option 'b', 'decreased diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (dlco)', is the correct answer.","B","B","USMLE question: A 45-year-old woman presents to the physician with a 6-month history of progressive shortness of breath.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's progressive dyspnea, chronic nonproductive cough, and smoking history are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), likely due to emphysema (given the absence of significant sputum production associated with chronic bronchitis). Emphysema is characterized by destruction of alveolar walls and loss of elastic recoil, which leads to air trapping and hyperinflation of the lungs. This often results in an increased residual volume (ie, the volume of air remaining in the lungs after forceful expiration). 

Option B would be incorrect as the diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is typically decreased in restrictive lung diseases and certain conditions that decrease the surface area of the lungs (eg, emphysema), but is not primarily affected in this case of likely chronic bronchitis.

Option C would be incorrect as the FEV1/FVC ratio is usually decreased in obstructive lung diseases like COPD, not increased. This is because the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is disproportionately reduced due to airway obstruction.

Option D would be incorrect as a shift of the flow volume loop to the right is seen in restrictive lung diseases, not obstructive diseases like COPD.

Option E would be incorrect as lung compliance is typically increased in emphysema due to the destruction of alveolar walls. This is opposite to decreased lung compliance, which is seen in restrictive lung diseases. Therefore, the correct answer is 'A' - decreased lung residual volume."
9740,"The answer is A: Proximal tubule.

The medication likely causing the serum calcium and magnesium levels decrease in this patient is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazide diuretics act on the distal convoluted tubule by inhibiting the sodium-chloride transporter. This leads to a reduction in sodium reabsorption and thus an increase in volume of urine produced (diuresis). While these diuretics can promote calcium reabsorption, they can also cause a decrease in serum magnesium levels, which is likely what is happening in this patient.

Now let's explain why the other options are not correct:

Option B: 'Descending loop of Henle' - The descending loop of Henle is primarily involved in the reabsorption of water, not electrolytes like calcium and magnesium.

Option C: 'Thick ascending loop of Henle' - Loop diuretics such as furosemide act on this part of the nephron. They inhibit the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter, leading to a decrease in sodium and chloride reabsorption. However, they do not typically affect calcium and magnesium levels.

Option D: 'Distal tubule' - As explained above, thiazide diuretics act on this part of the nephron. But since we are looking for a diuretic that decreases both calcium and magnesium, this is not the correct answer.

Option E: 'Cortical collecting duct' - This part of the nephron is where fine-tuning of urine composition occurs, particularly for water and sodium. Diuretics acting here (e.g., spironolactone, amiloride) do not typically affect calcium and magnesium levels. 

In conclusion, the proximal tubule is the primary site of action of diuretics that can decrease both calcium and magnesium levels, which likely explains this patient's lab results.","stop","the answer is a: proximal tubule.","A","C","USMLE question: A 68-year-old male with congestive heart failure recently had his medication regiment adjusted to better control his hypertension.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The answer is A: Proximal tubule.

The clinical scenario indicates that the patient's calcium and magnesium levels have decreased, which suggests the use of a diuretic that can cause these changes by increasing their urinary loss. The only diuretic that predominantly acts on the proximal tubule and can cause hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia is the thiazide class of diuretics. These drugs inhibit the sodium-chloride symporter in the proximal tubule, leading to increased excretion of sodium and water. Concurrently, they also promote calcium reabsorption in the distal tubule, which usually leads to hypercalcemia, not hypocalcemia. However, in cases of long-term use or high dosages, thiazides can lead to hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia due to secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Option B (Descending loop of Henle) is incorrect because diuretics acting here (osmotic diuretics like mannitol) do not affect calcium and magnesium levels.

Option C (Thick ascending loop of Henle) is incorrect because the diuretics acting here (loop diuretics like furosemide) would cause hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia, but they are not typically used for hypertension.

Option D (Distal tubule) is incorrect because the diuretics acting here (thiazide diuretics) typically cause hypercalcemia, not hypocalcemia.

927,"The patient's presentation and laboratory results suggest a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) due to lactic acidosis (elevated lactate level). This, in conjunction with the acute change in mental status, vomiting, and flushed skin, raises concern for the development of salicylate toxicity, which is a cause of HAGMA. Salicylates, such as aspirin, are used in the treatment of many conditions, but in the acute setting, they are most likely to be used in the treatment of a hypertensive crisis. Salicylates can cause direct stimulation of the respiratory center leading to hyperventilation and primary respiratory alkalosis. With chronic use or overdose, the metabolic acidosis due to the accumulation of organic acids (e.g., lactic acid, ketoacids) becomes more prominent.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's lethargy, headache, nausea, and vomiting in the setting of high serum lactate and low serum bicarbonate are suggestive of salicylate toxicity. The other laboratory findings (respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis on arterial blood gas) can also be seen in salicylate toxicity. Salicylates uncouple oxidative phosphorylation, leading to increased metabolic rate, hyperpnea (ie, respiratory alkalosis), and lactate generation (ie, high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis). Excessive sweating from increased metabolism and vasodilation can cause the flushed skin seen in this patient.

Salicylates are present in many over-the-counter medications and are a common cause of overdose in children and adults. In older adults, they are often used at high doses for their anti-inflammatory effect in conditions such as arthritis. Aspirin, a salicylate, is also used as an analgesic to treat headaches, such as a tension headache (Choice C). The other conditions do not typically require treatment with salicylates.

5813,"The correct answer is D: Presentation of viral peptides on MHC-II of CD4+ T cells. 

Influenza is a virus and the primary immune response to viral infection is cellular immunity. CD4+ T cells play a crucial role in the immune response to viral infections. Once a virus infects a cell, it begins to synthesize viral proteins. These viral proteins are then processed and presented on the cell surface by major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) molecules. Antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells present these viral peptides to naive CD4+ T cells, leading to their activation. Once activated, CD4+ T cells can differentiate into T-helper 1 cells (which activate cytotoxic T cells to kill virus-infected cells) or T-helper 2 cells (which help B cells to produce antibodies).

Option A: Eosinophils primarily fight parasitic infections, not viral infections.
Option B: Virus-specific immunoglobulins to remove free virus would be the correct response if the question asked about a secondary or subsequent infection. On the first infection, the body hasn't yet produced specific antibodies, so this is not the primary method of defense.
Option C: Complement-mediated lysis of infected cells typically targets bacterial cells rather than virus-infected cells.
Option E: Natural killer cells do play a role in fighting viral infections by recognizing and killing infected cells, but they do not rely on the MHC-II/CD4+ T cell mechanism.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is B: Virus-specific immunoglobulins to remove free virus.

The primary immune response to viral infections such as influenza involves both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Initially, the innate immune response is activated, including natural killer cells and interferon production. However, these responses would not be enough to combat the virus.

The adaptive immune response, which involves the production of virus-specific immunoglobulins (Ig), is crucial for the clearance of the virus. In a primary infection like the scenario described, the body will take several days to produce these specific antibodies. These immunoglobulins, particularly IgM and IgG, will bind to the virus, preventing it from infecting cells and marking it for destruction by other immune cells.

Option A: Eosinophils are more commonly involved in parasitic infections and allergic reactions, not viral infections.
Option C: The complement system can help in the clearance of viruses, but it's not the primary mechanism of action.
Option D: Presentation of viral peptides on MHC-II of CD4+ T cells is part of the immune response to viruses, but it's a step towards stimulating B cells to produce antibodies rather than a direct antiviral mechanism.

1274,"This patient's polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss with a good appetite, and the presence of glucose and ketones in the urine suggest a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus. The most acute life-threatening complication of type 1 diabetes is diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which seems to be the case in this patient. DKA is caused by a relative insulin deficiency, and it triggers the overproduction of counter-regulatory hormones such as glucagon, cortisol, catecholamines, and growth hormone. This hormonal imbalance stimulates gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, which lead to hyperglycemia and hyperketonemia due to increased lipolysis.

In DKA, the serum glucose concentration is often > 250 mg/dL, but not necessarily > 800 mg/dL (Option D). The hallmark of DKA is a low arterial blood pH due to metabolic acidosis, not an increased arterial blood pH (Option B). An increased arterial pCO2 (Option A) would suggest respiratory acidosis, but in DKA, patients hyperventilate in response to the metabolic acidosis, leading to a decreased pCO2, not an increased pCO2. Excess water retention (Option C) is not observed in DKA; instead, there is a total body water deficit due to osmotic diuresis from hyperglycemia.

The metabolic acidosis in DKA is due to the production of ketone bodies, which are acid substances. To compensate, the kidney excretes hydrogen ions and conserves bicarbonate, but it can't keep up with the acid production, and thus the blood pH decreases. This results in an increased anion gap metabolic acidosis. During this process, potassium is moved out of cells in exchange for hydrogen ions entering cells to buffer the high acid state, which leads to a total body deficit of potassium (Option E). Even if the serum potassium level is initially normal or high, treatment with insulin and fluids will drive potassium back into cells, potentially causing life-threatening hypokalemia.

'B: Increased arterial blood pH' - DKA is a form of metabolic acidosis, which results in a decreased arterial blood pH.

'C: Excess water retention' - The polyuria and polydipsia seen in diabetes are due to osmotic diuresis, which results in a net loss of water, not water retention.

'E: Decreased total body potassium' - While it's true that DKA can lead to a total body potassium deficit (due to loss in the urine), the acidosis can cause a shift of potassium out of cells and into the bloodstream, potentially causing hyperkalemia. Therefore, the serum potassium level may be normal or even elevated, despite the total body potassium deficit."

Mast cells, which reside in the skin, are part of the innate immune response and are one of the first responders to the vaccine. When activated, they degranulate and release histamine and other mediators that cause local vasodilation, edema, and recruitment of other immune cells.

The past history includes a coronary angiography for anginal chest pain 2 years ago, which showed 75% blockage in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. He takes medications on a daily basis, but is unable to remember the names. On physical examination, there is a palpable, non-tender mass in the right upper abdomen.

The serology is negative for hepatotropic viruses. The abdominal CT scan with contrast shows multifocal short segmental stricture of the bile duct outside the liver and mild dilation along with hypertrophy of the caudate lobe and atrophy of the left lateral and right posterior segments. The biopsy of the bile duct reveals periductal fibrosis with atypical bile duct cells in a desmoplastic stroma. Which of the following predisposing factors is responsible for this patientâ??s condition?
Option: {'A': 'Long term carcinogenic effect of the contrast agent', 'B': 'Chronic infection due to hepatitis virus', 'C': 'Idiopathic inflammatory scarring of the bile duct', 'D': 'Liver fluke induced inflammation leading to metaplastic change', 'E': 'Abnormal cystic dilation of the biliary tree'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's presentation of pruritus, jaundice, clay-colored stools (acholic stools), dark urine, weight loss, and abdominal mass along with lab findings of high alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels suggest obstructive jaundice due to cholangiocarcinoma (cancer of the bile ducts).

The biopsy result showing periductal fibrosis with atypical bile duct cells in a desmoplastic stroma confirms the diagnosis.
Cholangiocarcinomas are often associated with certain risk factors, including primary sclerosing cholangitis, choledochal cysts, chronic hepatitis C infection, and liver flukes (eg, Opisthorchis viverrini, Clonorchis sinensis). Given the patient's travel to Europe (where Clonorchis sinensis is endemic), the most likely predisposing factor is Option D: Liver fluke induced inflammation leading to metaplastic change.

Option A is incorrect. There is no evidence to suggest that contrast agents used in coronary angiography are associated with cholangiocarcinoma.

Option B is incorrect. Though chronic hepatitis, especially hepatitis C, can increase the risk of cholangiocarcinoma, this patient's serology is negative for hepatotropic viruses.

Option C is incorrect. While primary sclerosing cholangitis, which is characterized by idiopathic inflammatory scarring of the bile duct, is a major risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma, there's no history or evidence suggestive of such a condition in this patient.

2013,"The patient's presentation of fever, fatigue, headache, splenomegaly, and atypical lymphocytosis are classic for acute infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). However, EBV VCA antibodies and heterophile antibody assays are negative, suggesting another etiology. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can produce a mononucleosis-like syndrome identical to EBV, including atypical lymphocytosis and mild hepatocellular injury (as indicated by mildly elevated ALT). The heterophile antibody assay is typically negative in CMV mononucleosis, helping to distinguish it from EBV.

CMV can cause a wide variety of diseases in immunocompromised hosts, including retinitis, esophagitis, colitis, and polyradiculopathy.

However, about 10% of cases of IM are caused by CMV, and these patients would have a similar clinical presentation but a negative heterophile antibody test. CMV is usually a mild, asymptomatic infection in the immunocompetent host but can cause severe disease in the immunocompromised host, such as those with HIV/AIDS, organ transplant recipients, or patients on chronic immunosuppressive therapy.

5740,"The answer is C: Malignancy.

The laboratory results of this patient show hypercalcemia (increased serum calcium level), which is a common paraneoplastic syndrome. The hypercalcemia may be causing the patient's symptoms including abdominal pain, poor concentration, and weight loss. Malignancies, especially breast cancer and lung cancer, frequently cause hypercalcemia either by metastasizing to the bones and causing bone resorption or by producing a parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) that increases bone resorption and renal calcium reabsorption. The patient's other symptoms, like cough and worsening GERD, may be due to a lung malignancy.

Option A (Increased parathyroid hormone) and B (Increased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) can lead to hypercalcemia, but they often also present with hyperphosphatemia, which is not shown in this patient.

This patient's clinical features of cough, weight loss, abdominal pain, hypercalcemia (increased Ca2+), and a history of poorly controlled GERD despite medical treatment are suggestive of an underlying malignancy. Some malignancies can cause paraneoplastic syndromes such as the production of a hormone related to parathyroid hormone (parathyroid hormone-related peptide), which can lead to hypercalcemia. 

Option 'A': Increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) is incorrect as this would most likely present with symptoms of hypercalcemia such as constipation, depression, polyuria, and renal stones. There was no evidence of renal stones in her lab results.

Option 'B': Increased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is incorrect as this is unlikely to be the underlying cause given the patient's symptoms and demographics. This condition is more commonly seen in patients with granulomatous diseases like sarcoidosis, which does not align with her presentation.

Option 'D': Antacid overuse can lead to a condition known as milk-alkali syndrome characterized by hypercalcemia, renal failure, and metabolic alkalosis. However, this patient has normal renal function and no evidence of metabolic alkalosis, which makes this option less likely.

694,"The correct answer is B, Endoscopy. 

This patient's symptoms of progressive dysphagia to both solids and liquids and recent travel to South America should raise suspicion for Chagas disease. Chagas disease is a tropical parasitic disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, transmitted to humans by the bite of a reduviid bug. Most acute infections are asymptomatic, but chronic infection can lead to damage of the heart and GI tract. The esophagus is often involved, resulting in achalasia (due to destruction of the myenteric plexus) and megaesophagus. Patients typically present with dysphagia to both solids and liquids, which worsens over time. Diagnosis is typically made by detecting T. cruzi antibodies in serum; however, esophageal involvement is best determined by barium swallow or endoscopy. Given this patient's progressive symptoms, endoscopy would be the best next step in management to evaluate for possible esophageal stricture, malignancy, or other structural abnormalities that may be causing his symptoms.

Option A, Barium swallow is useful for visualizing the esophagus and identifying structural abnormalities such as a stricture or achalasia. However, it does not allow for biopsy or direct visualization of the mucosa, which are needed to rule out malignancy. 

Option C, Manometry is used to assess motor function of the esophagus and would be useful if a motility disorder (such as achalasia) is suspected. However, this patient's recent travel to an endemic area and progressive symptoms make Chagas disease with esophageal involvement more likely.

Option D, Myotomy is a surgical procedure used to treat achalasia when other treatments have failed. This would not be appropriate at this time as the exact cause of the patient's symptoms has not been identified.

The Pap smear, or Papanicolaou test, is a screening procedure for cervical cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, all women should begin cervical cancer screening at age 21. This patient is sexually active and has inconsistent condom use which can increase her risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including human papillomavirus (HPV), a common cause of cervical cancer. 

Now, let's discuss why the other options are wrong:

Option 'A': Complete blood count (CBC) - A CBC could be considered if the patient was showing signs of illness or infection, but her physical examination is normal and she reports feeling well. Therefore, a CBC is not indicated at this time.

Option 'B': Nucleic acid amplification testing - This test is used to detect certain STIs, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea. While the patient's inconsistent condom use does put her at risk for STIs, this test would not be the most appropriate next step in management.

Option 'D': Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test - The RPR test is used to screen for syphilis. Again, while the patient is at risk for STIs, this would not be the most appropriate next step in her care.

Option 'E': Herpes simplex virus 2 serology - This test is used to detect antibodies against the herpes simplex virus type 2. While the patient is at risk for herpes due to her inconsistent condom use, this would not be the most appropriate next step in her care. Herpes serology is not routinely performed unless there are symptoms suggestive of herpes infection.

2315,"The woman's DEXA scan findings and history of breast cancer and endometrial cancer suggest a diagnosis of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The most appropriate treatment in this patient is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), such as raloxifene. The answer is (B) Estrogen receptor antagonist in the uterus.

SERMs act as estrogen receptor agonists in some tissues (eg, bone, liver) and as estrogen receptor antagonists in others (eg, breast, uterus).

Given her history of two hormone-sensitive cancers (breast and endometrial cancer), the most appropriate first-line treatment for osteoporosis in this patient would be a bisphosphonate, such as alendronate. Bisphosphonates work by attaching to hydroxyapatite binding sites on bony surfaces, especially those undergoing active resorption, and are thereby ingested by osteoclasts. The bisphosphonate compounds then induce osteoclast apoptosis, leading to decreased bone resorption and turnover (Choice C). 

The other options all represent different treatments for osteoporosis. However, they would not be appropriate first-line therapies in this patient. Raloxifene (Choice A) is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that acts as an estrogen receptor agonist in bone. However, it acts as an estrogen receptor antagonist in breast and uterine tissue, making it a good choice for osteoporosis prevention in patients with a history of hormone-sensitive cancers (Choice B). Unfortunately, it is less effective than bisphosphonates at increasing bone mineral density and preventing fractures. Calcitonin (Choice D) is a hormone that can be used in osteoporosis to inhibit osteoclast activity, but it is less effective than other treatments and is not typically used as first-line therapy. Lastly, teriparatide (Choice E) is a recombinant form of parathyroid hormone that actually increases bone turnover and bone mineral density.

This patient's presentation of chest pain characterized as substernal and squeezing, associated with diaphoresis in the setting of recent percutaneous coronary intervention, is highly concerning for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The first diagnostic test in patients with suspected ACS is an ECG, ideally performed within 10 minutes of presentation. The purpose of this initial ECG is to identify ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), which requires immediate reperfusion therapy with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or, if PCI is not available, fibrinolytics. If the ECG does not show changes diagnostic of STEMI, the next step is to obtain cardiac biomarkers (eg, troponins).

38,"The correct answer is 'C': Low X and high Y. 

In enzyme kinetics, the maximum speed an enzyme can operate at is known as the Vmax, equivalent to the speed Y in the question. The lower the value of X (the concentration of glucose needed to achieve half of Y), the higher the enzyme's affinity for its substrate. This is because it requires less substrate to achieve half its maximum speed.

She discovers that the enzyme is present in most body tissues and is located in the cytoplasm of the cells expressing the enzyme. She decides to mix this enzyme under subphysiologic conditions with varying levels of glucose in order to determine the kinetic properties of the enzyme. Specifically, she adds increasing levels of glucose at a saturating concentration of phosphate and sees that the rate at which glucose becomes phosphorylated gets faster at higher levels of glucose. She observes that this rate approaches a maximum speed and calls this speed Y. She then determines the concentration of glucose that is needed to make the enzyme function at half the speed Y and calls this concentration X. Which of the following is most likely true about the properties of this enzyme?
Option: {'A': 'High X and high Y', 'B': 'High X and low Y', 'C': 'Low X and high Y', 'D': 'Low X and infinite Y', 'E': 'Low X and low Y'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is C: Low X and high Y.

The researcher is studying the Michaelis-Menten kinetics of an enzyme. In this model, the maximum speed of the enzyme reaction is called Vmax (in the question, this is referred to as Y) and the substrate concentration at which the reaction is at half its maximum speed is called Km (in the question, this is referred to as X). 

A high Vmax (Y) means that the enzyme can process a large amount of substrate in a given period of time. This implies that the enzyme is very efficient. Therefore, in the context of the Michaelis-Menten model, a high Vmax (Y) is desirable. 

The Km (X) is inversely related to the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate. A low Km (X) means that the enzyme has a high affinity for its substrate, as it requires less substrate to reach half of its maximum speed. Therefore, a low Km (X) is also desirable in the context of the Michaelis-Menten model.

Options 'A' and 'B' imply a high Km (X), suggesting a low affinity of the enzyme for glucose. Option 'D' suggests an infinite Vmax (Y), which is theoretically impossible. Option 'E' suggests a low Vmax (Y), indicating a less efficient enzyme. Therefore, these options are incorrect."
5717,"This patient with gestational diabetes that remains uncontrolled despite diet and lifestyle modifications is most likely to benefit from insulin therapy. Insulin binds to the insulin receptor, a tyrosine kinase receptor, leading to autophosphorylation of the receptor and subsequent intracellular signaling cascades that promote glucose uptake, primarily in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, and inhibit hepatic glucose production. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

Option A: Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (eg, sitagliptin, linagliptin) prevent the inactivation of incretins, hormones that stimulate glucose-dependent insulin release. They are used in the management of type 2 diabetes but are not first-line treatment for gestational diabetes.
Option C: Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (eg, acarbose) delay carbohydrate hydrolysis and glucose absorption, leading to a blunted postprandial hyperglycemic curve. These agents are less effective than other oral hypoglycemics and are typically reserved for patients who cannot use or have not responded to other agents.
Option D: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma activators (eg, thiazolidinediones) increase insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues and decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis. They are used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes but are contraindicated in pregnancy due to potential fetal toxicity.
Option E: Sulfonylureas (eg, glipizide, glyburide) close ATP-dependent potassium channels in the pancreatic beta-cell membrane, leading to cell depolarization, calcium influx, and increased insulin secretion.

9499,"The correct answer is 'C: Gait ataxia in this condition is a pure sensory ataxia.' The patient's condition is most likely Friedreich's ataxia, a hereditary disease caused by a GAA trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FXN gene. It is characterized by progressive damage to the nervous system resulting in symptoms ranging from gait disturbance and speech problems to heart disease. 

The sensory ataxia results from the degeneration of large sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia and is characterized by an unsteady, wide-based gait, with a tendency to veer to one side. The sensory loss also leads to an absence of deep tendon reflexes, as observed in this patient.

Now, let's see why the other options are incorrect.

Option A is incorrect because nystagmus in Friedreich's ataxia is typically horizontal, not vertical.

Option B is incorrect because although heart disease, particularly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is common in Friedreich's ataxia, restrictive cardiomyopathy is not typically seen in approximately 50% of the patients. 

Option D is incorrect because the FXN gene associated with Friedreich's ataxia is located on chromosome 9q13-q21.1, not on chromosome 9.

Option E is incorrect because Friedreich's ataxia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, not an autosomal dominant pattern.

His gait was clumsy and slow, and it was very difficult for him to perform brisk walking and running. After a few years, he developed tremors involving both upper limbs along with progressively increasing fatigability. Over the last several months, his friends have noticed that his speech has become slow, slurred, and sometimes incomprehensible. He has also developed difficulty in swallowing recently. On physical examination, he is vitally stable with normal sensorium and normal higher mental functions. The neurological examination reveals absent deep tendon reflexes in the lower extremities and the extensor plantar response bilaterally. Muscle tone is normal in different muscle groups with significant distal muscle wasting in the extremities. There is a marked loss of vibration and position senses. His gait is ataxic and nystagmus is present. His speech is explosive and dysarthric.

The patient's symptoms and the result of the genetic testing indicate that he has Friedreich's ataxia, a rare genetic disease that causes difficulty walking, a loss of sensation in the arms and legs, and impaired speech. This condition is caused by an expansion of GAA trinucleotide repeats in the frataxin gene on chromosome 9. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, not dominant, which eliminates option 'E'.

1656,"The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is option A: Bilateral uncal herniation.

The sudden onset of a severe headache and visual symptoms in a patient who has had a head injury is suggestive of increased intracranial pressure, and when the uncus, the innermost part of the temporal lobe, herniates, it compresses the third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve). Bilateral uncal herniation would cause bilateral oculomotor nerve palsy, leading to an inability to move the eye outwards (i.e., right eye cannot move right past midline, left eye cannot move left past midline).

Option B: Central herniation is less likely as it would cause a decrease in consciousness, not visual problems.

Option C: Subfalcine herniation is a type of herniation where the cingulate gyrus is displaced under the falx cerebri. It does not typically present with visual symptoms but can cause leg weakness due to compression of the anterior cerebral artery.

Option D: Tonsillar herniation (or cerebellar tonsil herniation into the foramen magnum) would cause brainstem signs such as respiratory and cardiac dysfunction. It does not typically present with visual symptoms.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The most likely cause of this patient's visual defects is 'A': Bilateral uncal herniation. 

In the context of head trauma in a patient presenting with the worst headache of life, a likely diagnosis is hemorrhage leading to increased intracranial pressure and herniation. The description of visual problems with double vision when looking to the sides is consistent with bilateral dysfunction of cranial nerve VI (abducens nerve), which innervates the lateral rectus muscle of the eye and is responsible for lateral gaze. The abducens nerves travel along the base of the brain and are susceptible to injury from increased intracranial pressure, specifically in the case of uncal herniation, where the medial part of the temporal lobes (the uncus) herniates downward, compressing the brainstem and cranial nerves. When both sides are affected, it is called bilateral uncal herniation.

'B': Central herniation, 'C': Subfalcine herniation, 'D': Tonsillar herniation, and 'E': Unilateral uncal herniation are less likely to cause the bilateral eye movement abnormalities described in this patient. Central herniation involves downward displacement of the brain due to generalized brain swelling, and generally causes a decreased level of consciousness before causing ocular symptoms. Subfalcine herniation involves displacement of part of the frontal lobe under the falx cerebri, causing localized pressure effects. Tonsillar herniation involves downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum, causing brainstem compression and symptoms like loss of consciousness, respiratory depression and neck stiffness. Unilateral uncal herniation would typically cause symptoms on one side, not both."
234,"The correct answer is B: Essential hypertension.

Ischemic colitis is a condition that develops when blood flow to the colon is reduced, typically due to narrowing or blockage of the blood vessels (vasoconstriction). This can cause pain and bloody stools. Risk factors include age, hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking, and certain medications.

Option B, Essential hypertension, is the most likely predisposition in this case as it can lead to atherosclerosis, a condition where the arteries become narrowed and hardened due to a buildup of plaque around the artery wall. This could reduce blood flow to the colon, leading to ischemic colitis. 

Option A, Increased splanchnic blood flow following a large meal, is unlikely to lead to ischemic colitis. In fact, reduced splanchnic blood flow might contribute to ischemic colitis, but not increased flow. 

Option C, Obstruction of the abdominal aorta following surgery, could theoretically lead to ischemic colitis, but the question does not mention any recent surgeries.

5109,"The correct answer is B. Sciatic Nerve.

The sciatic nerve is the major nerve supplying the posterior compartment of the thigh and all parts of the leg and foot, except for the medial aspect, which is innervated by the saphenous nerve, a branch of the femoral nerve. Increased muscle tone (spasticity) in the thigh muscle, as described in this patient, indicates hyperactivity of the lower motor neurons supplying these muscles, which are under the control of the sciatic nerve. Blocking this nerve with a local anesthetic will interrupt this hyperactivity, thereby reducing muscle tone and possibly improving the patient's cramps.

Option A, the obturator nerve, primarily supplies the medial compartment of the thigh, which is primarily responsible for adduction of the thigh. Thus, blocking this nerve would not likely improve the patient's condition.

Option C, the inferior gluteal nerve, mainly supplies the gluteus maximus muscle, which is involved in extension and lateral rotation of the hip. Blocking this nerve would not be beneficial for this patient's condition.

Option D, the femoral nerve, provides motor innervation to the anterior compartment of the thigh, which is involved in hip flexion and knee extension. Blocking this nerve would not likely improve the patient's condition.

The patient's presentation of cramps in her left leg along with increased muscle tone in the thigh muscles suggests spasticity, a common symptom in multiple sclerosis. Spasticity, or increased muscle tone, can result in spasms, stiffness, and pain. The sciatic nerve, the largest nerve in the body, provides innervation to most of the lower leg and foot. By blocking the sciatic nerve, the muscle tone may decrease, thereby relieving the patient's symptoms.

Option A: The obturator nerve primarily innervates the medial compartment of the thigh, which includes the adductor muscles. It wouldn't likely be involved with the patient's symptoms.

Option C: The inferior gluteal nerve innervates the gluteus maximus muscle, which is mainly responsible for hip extension and external rotation. Blocking this nerve wouldn't likely address the symptoms in the thigh.

The limited blood supply to this area can also lead to slow healing and potential complications such as avascular necrosis. 

Option 'A': Reduced osteoblastic activity and 'D': Impaired bone mineralization are typically associated with osteoporosis, a condition characterized by low bone mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue. However, this patient's normal serum creatinine and lack of other risk factors for osteoporosis (such as smoking, excessive alcohol intake, and postmenopausal status) make this less likely.

When people live at high altitudes, their bodies adapt to the lower oxygen levels in several ways. One of these is by decreasing pulmonary vascular resistance. This is achieved by increasing the diameter of the blood vessels in the lungs, which reduces the resistance to blood flow and allows more oxygen to be picked up by the red blood cells.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

'A': Decreased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration would actually impair oxygen-carrying capacity as it refers to the average concentration of hemoglobin in a given volume of blood. Living at high altitudes typically prompts the body to produce more red blood cells and thus more hemoglobin, not less.

'B': Decreased red blood cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) would impair oxygen delivery to tissues. Increased levels of 2,3-DPG actually enhance oxygen delivery by promoting the release of oxygen from hemoglobin in the peripheral tissues. Chronic exposure to high altitudes is associated with increased 2,3-DPG.

'C': Decreased oxygen binding ability of hemoglobin would mean that less oxygen can be carried in the blood, which would be disadvantageous in a low-oxygen environment. At high altitudes, the body adapts to increase the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder commonly seen in patients of Northern European descent, but it can also occur in other ethnicities. Patients with this condition have a mutation in the HFE gene, which leads to increased intestinal absorption of dietary iron. Over time, the excess iron accumulates in various organs (eg, heart, liver, pancreas, joints), leading to organ damage. Symptoms typically begin in the middle age and include fatigue, arthritis, and diabetes mellitus (bronze diabetes), as seen in this patient. The skin may also darken (""bronze"") due to iron deposition and increased melanin.

5257,"This patient's difficulty climbing stairs, running, and standing up from a seated position, along with hypertrophy of the calves and a waddling gait, are classic findings in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). DMD is an X-linked recessive disorder caused most commonly by deletion mutations (60-65% of cases) in the dystrophin gene, leading to the production of a nonfunctional dystrophin protein. The dystrophin protein normally helps to anchor the cytoskeleton of muscle fibers, and loss of this protein leads to muscle fiber damage and necrosis over time. Clinically, patients typically present with delayed motor milestones or difficulty running, climbing stairs, or standing up from the floor. On examination, Gower sign (using the upper extremities to stand up) is typically present, and the calves may be hypertrophically enlarged due to fibrofatty replacement of muscle. 

Here the closest answer is 'E' Frameshift mutation, although the most accurate answer would be deletion mutation, which is not an option here. Frameshift mutations can cause significant alterations in the resulting protein, similar to the large deletion mutations seen in DMD.

Option 'A' Nonsense mutation results in a premature stop codon leading to a truncated protein. This is not the typical mutation seen in DMD.

Option 'B' Missense mutation results in a change in one amino acid for another in a protein, which is not the typical mutation seen in DMD.

Option 'C' Trinucleotide repeat expansions are seen in diseases like Huntington's disease and some types of spinocerebellar ataxias, not DMD.

5254,"The answer is A: IgG.

The Hepatitis B vaccine is a recombinant vaccine that produces a protective immune response in the form of IgG anti-HBs (antibodies against the hepatitis B surface antigen). This specific type of antibody provides long-term protection against future infections.

B: IgA plays a crucial role in mucosal immunity, and it's not primarily involved in the response to the Hepatitis B vaccine.
C: IgM is usually the first antibody to be produced in response to an antigen and is mainly responsible for the primary immune response. However, the hepatitis B vaccine is intended to increase levels of IgG, not IgM, for long-term immunity.
D: IgD function is not entirely understood, but it is believed to play a role in allergic reactions and in the activation of B cells. It's not primarily involved in the response to the Hepatitis B vaccine.

Explanation: IgG is the most abundant type of antibody and is found in all bodily fluids. It provides long-term protection against most pathogens, as it is the only antibody that can cross the placenta, providing passive immunity to the fetus during pregnancy. IgG antibodies are produced in a secondary immune response, which is what occurs following vaccination. The goal of vaccination is to trigger an immune response so that the body will recognize and quickly respond to the pathogen in the future, and this response is largely mediated by IgG antibodies.

She was appropriately started on propylthiouracil and propranolol. Propylthiouracil works by inhibiting thyroid peroxidase, thereby blocking the synthesis of thyroid hormones, and by inhibiting the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. Propranolol is a non-selective beta blocker that can help control the adrenergic symptoms of hyperthyroidism (e.g., tachycardia, tremors).

Her return visit a week later with fatigue and a high TSH level indicates that she has become hypothyroid, likely due to overtreatment.

Subacute thyroiditis typically involves a hyperthyroid phase that lasts 2-6 weeks, followed by a hypothyroid phase that can last up to 3 months before eventual return to a euthyroid state.

In this patient, the initial hyperthyroidism was treated with propranolol for symptom control (e.g., palpitations, tremors) and propylthiouracil to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis. However, on follow-up, her elevated TSH is consistent with the expected transition to hypothyroidism. Propylthiouracil is no longer needed and may even be harmful in this phase as it may further decrease thyroid hormone production and worsen symptoms. In symptomatic patients like this one who present with severe fatigue, the best next step in management is a short course of levothyroxine (T4) (Choice C).

Choices A and B are incorrect as this patient's hypothyroid symptoms are likely due to the natural course of subacute thyroiditis rather than over-treatment with medications.

715,"The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is Option A: Deficiency in a coagulation factor. 

The laboratory findings in this patient, with a normal PT but prolonged PTT that does not correct on mixing studies, suggest the presence of a coagulation factor deficiency. The PT measures the extrinsic and common pathways of coagulation (factors VII, X, V, II, and fibrinogen), while the PTT measures the intrinsic and common pathways (factors XII, XI, IX, VIII, X, V, II, and fibrinogen). Mixing studies are performed by mixing the patient's plasma with normal plasma; if the PTT corrects, this implies the patient's plasma was deficient in a coagulation factor present in the normal plasma (which is typically seen in hemophilia A and B due to deficiencies of factors VIII and IX, respectively). If the PTT does not correct, as in this case, this implies the presence of an inhibitor, such as an autoantibody against a clotting factor (e.g., factor VIII inhibitor) or a nonspecific inhibitor (e.g., lupus anticoagulant). However, these inhibitors are rare in children, making a factor deficiency more likely.

Option B is incorrect because von Willebrand factor deficiency typically presents with mucocutaneous bleeding (e.g., epistaxis, menorrhagia) rather than deep joint bleeds.

Option C is incorrect because platelet defects typically result in prolonged bleeding times, which is not seen in this patient.

The boy's prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) suggests a defect in the intrinsic or common coagulation pathway. The fact that mixing studies did not correct the PTT indicates that the cause is likely a deficiency in a factor, as opposed to an inhibitor (which would have been corrected by the addition of normal plasma). This, along with the history of easy bruising, suggests hemophilia, a X-linked recessive disorder that typically presents in male children with excessive bleeding or bruising.

'B': Deficiency of von Willebrand factor would present with a prolonged bleeding time and possibly a mildly elevated PTT, which is not the case here.

'C': Platelet defect is unlikely because the bleeding time, which is most reflective of platelet function, is normal.

In this case, the cohort is the group of patients who were active cocaine users but did not have a history of syphilis. They were followed over a six-month period to see if they developed syphilis. The investigators then compared the rate of syphilis in this group to the rate in patients without cocaine use. This is a direct definition of a prospective cohort study.

B: Case-control study: This is a retrospective study where two existing groups differing in outcome are identified and compared on the basis of some supposed causal attribute. In this case, the investigators did not start with a group of patients with syphilis (cases) and a group without (controls) and then look back to see if cocaine use was more common in the cases.

C: Meta-analysis: This is a statistical analysis that combines the results of multiple scientific studies. There was no mention of multiple studies being combined in the question.

A prospective cohort study involves identifying patients according to their exposure status (in this case, cocaine use), then following them over time to see if they develop the disease of interest (in this case, syphilis). The exposed and unexposed groups are compared to see if there's a difference in disease rates.

Option B is incorrect because a case-control study involves identifying cases (people with the disease) and controls (people without the disease) then looking backwards in time to see if there's a difference in exposure rates. This is the opposite of the study described.

Option C is incorrect because a meta-analysis involves combining the results from multiple individual studies to get a more reliable estimate of the effect of an exposure on a disease. It doesn't involve collecting primary data.

Option D is incorrect because a cross-sectional study involves measuring the exposure and disease status at the same point in time. It doesn't involve following people over time.

Option E is incorrect because a retrospective cohort study involves identifying people according to their exposure status then looking backwards in time to see if they developed the disease.

The short gastric arteries supply the upper part of the greater curvature of the stomach, where sleeve gastrectomy is typically started. These arteries originate directly from the splenic artery or its branches and are responsible for vascularizing the fundus and upper body of the stomach.

Option B: The splenic artery does not directly supply the stomach; instead, it gives off several branches, including the short gastric arteries, that supply the stomach.

Option C: The right gastric artery usually originates from the common hepatic artery (a branch of the celiac trunk) and runs along the lesser curvature of the stomach. Therefore, it would not supply the greater curvature of the stomach where the incision is made during a sleeve gastrectomy.

Option D: The right gastroepiploic artery (also known as the right gastro-omental artery) does supply the greater curvature of the stomach.

A complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is one that occurs in a patient with a structural or functional abnormality of the urinary tract that may interfere with normal urinary flow or voiding and predispose to persistent or recurrent infection or treatment failure. This can include factors such as urinary retention, urinary tract stones (nephrolithiasis), urinary tract obstruction, renal insufficiency, immunosuppression, or the presence of an indwelling urinary catheter. 

Patients with diabetes, like this woman, are also at increased risk for complicated UTIs due to factors such as glucose in the urine that can facilitate bacterial growth and impaired host immune response. UTIs caused by atypical organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is seen typically in hospital-acquired infections, are also generally considered complicated because they may be associated with underlying urinary tract abnormalities and are often resistant to first-line antibiotics.

However, the mere presence of an atypical organism, such as Candida albicans, does not in itself define a UTI as complicated. Candida species are not commonly involved in uncomplicated UTIs, but they may cause UTIs in patients with other predisposing risk factors such as immunosuppression or an indwelling urinary catheter. Nonetheless, the organism itself does not dictate whether a UTI is categorized as complicated or uncomplicated, but rather the underlying conditions that predispose to infection. Therefore, the answer is option B."

537,"The most likely explanation for this patient's glucosuria is 'E': Increased glomerular filtration rate.

However, in some cases, like this patient's, the filtered glucose load may exceed the tubules' reabsorption capacity, leading to glucosuria. This is a normal finding during pregnancy and does not indicate gestational diabetes.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

Option 'A': Decreased insulin production: This would lead to hyperglycemia and potentially glucosuria. However, the patient's non-fasting serum glucose concentration is normal, ruling out this option.

Option 'B': Decreased SGLT2 expression: SGLT2 is a protein that helps reabsorb glucose in the kidneys. While decreased expression would lead to glucosuria, this typically isn't seen in pregnancy.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The most likely explanation for this patient's glucosuria is option B: 'Decreased SGLT2 expression'.

During pregnancy, the kidneys increase their filtration rate due to increased blood volume and metabolic demand of the growing fetus. Sodium-glucose cotransporters (SGLT) in the proximal tubule, especially SGLT2, reabsorb the majority of the filtered glucose. As the glomerular filtration rate increases, the amount of glucose filtered exceeds the reabsorptive capacity of the proximal tubule, resulting in glucosuria. This is a normal physiological adaptation to pregnancy and does not imply gestational diabetes, which is typically diagnosed with a glucose tolerance test.

Option A, 'Decreased insulin production', is incorrect because insulin production actually increases during pregnancy to compensate for increased insulin resistance. This patient's non-fasting glucose level is within the normal range, suggesting that her insulin production is adequate.

Option C, 'Increased glomerular filtration barrier permeability', is incorrect because changes in the filtration barrier's permeability do not occur in normal pregnancy and would result in proteinuria, not glucosuria.

Option D, 'Decreased insulin sensitivity', is incorrect because, while insulin resistance does increase during pregnancy as a normal physiological adaptation, this patient's non-fasting glucose level is within the normal range, suggesting that her insulin sensitivity is adequate.

Option E, 'Increased glomerular filtration rate', is incorrect because, while the glomerular filtration rate does increase during pregnancy, this alone would not lead to glucosuria.

PDB is a disorder of the bone remodeling process that begins with excessive osteoclastic bone resorption, followed by an increased, disorganized osteoblastic activity. This produces bone that is larger but weaker and more vascular. The mosaic pattern (""jigsaw puzzle"") seen on histology is due to the haphazard arrangement of the lamellar bone. The disease often affects the axial skeleton (eg, pelvis, vertebrae, skull) and the proximal femur and tibia. Skull involvement may cause hearing loss due to compromise of the auditory foramina. On plain radiography, PDB often presents with a mixed picture of lytic and sclerotic lesions; however, late in the disease, the affected bone demonstrates a dense, sclerotic appearance due to the disorganized new bone formation. Therefore, the correct answer is E, Generalized dense, sclerotic bone.

Option A is incorrect. Lytic lesions with no sclerotic margin are usually seen in multiple myeloma, not in Paget disease.
Option B is incorrect. Multiple, well-defined, punched out lytic lesions is characteristic of multiple myeloma.

The patient's presentation of increased skull size and bone pain, as well as hearing loss and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, is suggestive of Paget's disease of bone. This is a disorder of the bone remodeling process that leads to enlarged and misshapen bones. The skull, pelvis, spine, and long bones are typically affected. Radiologic findings in Paget's disease show a mixed picture in the early stages, with both lytic and sclerotic areas. However, as the disease progresses, it becomes dominated by sclerosis as seen in this patient, leading to a generalized increase in bone density (option E).

Option A - Lytic lesions with no sclerotic margin - is typically seen in metastatic cancer, not Paget's disease.

Option B - Multiple, well-defined, punched out lytic lesions - are more characteristic of multiple myeloma.

Option C - Mixed lytic and sclerotic lesions - are seen in the early stages of Paget's disease, but as mentioned, the disease progresses to a primarily sclerotic phase.

Option D - Periosteal trabeculations with radiolucent marrow hyperplasia - is indicative of osteopetrosis, a rare genetic disorder characterized by the body's inability to form mature bone tissue.

1781,"This patient's symptoms of lightheadedness, nausea, and blurred vision that resolve after ingestion of juice suggest episodes of hypoglycemia. Her use of glipizide, a sulfonylurea, is most likely the cause. Sulfonylureas stimulate insulin release from pancreatic beta cells and can cause hypoglycemia, especially in patients with decreased caloric intake or increased energy expenditure (eg, exercise, increased physical activity). Her additional symptoms of intermittent right arm heaviness and paresthesia may be due to transient ischemic attacks secondary to hypoglycemia. Thus, the correct answer is A, adverse effect of medications.

Option B, reversed blood flow in the right vertebral artery, would suggest subclavian steal syndrome. However, this condition typically presents with arm claudication or syncope associated with upper extremity exercise rather than with the symptoms of hypoglycemia seen here.

Option C, non-enzymatic glycosylation of peripheral nerve, is a process that leads to diabetic neuropathy. However, this condition usually presents with a distal symmetric polyneuropathy, not the symptoms seen in this patient.

Option D, compression of neurovascular structures in the neck, could suggest thoracic outlet syndrome, but it does not explain the patient's episodes of lightheadedness, nausea, and blurred vision.

This patient's symptoms of arm heaviness and paresthesias, lightheadedness, nausea, blurred vision, and diminished radial and brachial pulses in the right upper extremity are suggestive of subclavian steal syndrome. This condition occurs when there is a stenosis or occlusion of the proximal subclavian artery, usually secondary to atherosclerosis. The resultant proximal blood flow obstruction leads to retrograde flow in the ipsilateral vertebral artery to supply the arm, 'stealing' blood from the vertebrobasilar system. This diversion of blood flow can cause vertebrobasilar insufficiency with resultant symptoms such as dizziness/lightheadedness, visual disturbances, and imbalance.

Option 'A': Adverse effect of medications is incorrect because although some of the medications the patient is taking may have side effects, none of them would create these symptoms.

Option 'B': Reversed blood flow in the right vertebral artery is partially correct, as this is a mechanism of subclavian steal syndrome, but it is the result of the primary pathologic process, not the cause.

Option 'C': Non-enzymatic glycosylation of peripheral nerve is often seen in diabetic patients and may cause peripheral neuropathy, but it would not cause the decreased radial and brachial pulses and cooler skin seen in this patient.

1990,"The correct answer is C. '17'. The clinical picture is suggestive of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), an autosomal dominant condition characterized by the development of hundreds to thousands of adenomatous polyps in the colon and rectum during adolescence. If left untreated, there is nearly a 100% risk of colorectal cancer, often by the age of 40. FAP is caused by a mutation in the APC gene, which is located on chromosome 5q21. However, this patient's younger age at presentation and the severity of polyp disease suggest a diagnosis of Attenuated FAP, which is caused by mutations at the extreme 5' (promoter region) and 3' ends of the APC gene, or of MUTYH-Associated Polyposis, an autosomal recessive condition caused by mutations in the MUTYH gene on chromosome 1p34.2-p32.1. Both conditions are associated with a somewhat lower colorectal cancer risk compared with classic FAP.

Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect. Chromosome 5 is associated with classic FAP, but this patient's younger age and severe polyp disease suggest a different diagnosis.

The patient is presenting with multiple colorectal adenomas which is suggestive of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP). FAP is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene which is located on chromosome 17. FAP is characterized by the development of hundreds to thousands of adenomatous polyps in the colon and rectum during the second decade of life. If left untreated, there is an almost 100% chance of developing colon cancer by the fifth decade of life.

Option 'A' is incorrect because chromosome 5 is involved in familial adenomatous polyposis, but this is usually in conjunction with a mutation on chromosome 15. 
Option 'B' is incorrect as chromosome 7 is related to cystic fibrosis.
Option 'D' is incorrect because chromosome 19 is associated with familial hypercholesterolemia.
Option 'E' is incorrect as the X chromosome is associated with many X-linked disorders including hemophilia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. 

Also, it is important to note that Alzheimer's disease, which is present in the patient's grandfather, is more commonly associated with mutations in the APOE gene on chromosome 19, not the APC gene on chromosome 17.

Initial pharmacologic treatment usually includes a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), corticosteroids, or colchicine. In this patient, the best treatment option would be oral methylprednisolone and meloxicam (Option B).

Let's discuss why the other options are not ideal:

Option A: Probenecid is a uricosuric drug used in chronic gout to increase the urinary excretion of uric acid. It should not be used in acute gout.

Option C: Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is used for the long-term management of gout to decrease uric acid production. However, it should not be initiated during an acute gout attack as it can potentially worsen the attack.

Option D: While colchicine is used for acute gout, the combination with celecoxib (a type of NSAID) isn't typically recommended due to increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects.

Option E: While NSAIDs alone can be used for acute gout, the use of diclofenac alone might not provide sufficient relief for severe cases. Adding a corticosteroid like methylprednisolone could offer more effective control of symptoms. 

In summary, the best answer is Option B, oral methylprednisolone and meloxicam, because it provides the most effective acute gout treatment."

ST-segment elevation in V1 and V2 suggests occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery, likely due to thromboembolism from a dilated, dissected, or aneurysmal aorta. Marfan syndrome patients have a high risk of aortic dissection and aneurysm due to defective connective tissue.

Option 'A': Bilateral gynecomastia is often seen in Klinefelter syndrome, not Marfan syndrome.
Option 'B': Downward lens subluxation is seen in homocystinuria, not Marfan syndrome (where upward lens subluxation is common).
Option 'C': Macroorchidism is seen in Fragile X syndrome, not Marfan syndrome.
Option 'D': Saccular cerebral aneurysms are seen in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, not Marfan syndrome."
8770,"The most appropriate next step in management is CT-guided percutaneous drainage (Option B). This patient's history of recurrent pancreatitis and the finding on CT scan of a well-circumscribed, low attenuation oval area suggest a pancreatic pseudocyst. Pancreatic pseudocysts are complications of pancreatitis that occur when fluid collections become walled off by granulation tissue. If symptomatic, as in this patient, or larger than 6 cm, they require treatment to prevent complications (eg, rupture, infection). Initial treatment is typically CT-guided percutaneous drainage. If the pseudocyst recurs after percutaneous drainage, endoscopic drainage or surgical drainage may be necessary.

Pancreatic pseudocysts are a common complication of chronic pancreatitis and can present with abdominal pain, early satiety, and weight loss due to compression of the stomach or duodenum. Most pseudocysts resolve spontaneously and can be managed conservatively with bowel rest and observation. However, symptomatic or enlarging pseudocysts (>6 cm or persistent >6 weeks) can be managed with CT-guided percutaneous drainage, endoscopic drainage, or surgical drainage (option E). Surgical intervention is reserved for cases in which there is suspicion of malignancy or complications, such as pseudocysts that are infected, rupture, hemorrhage, or cause biliary obstruction. In this case, the pseudocyst is large and likely causing this patient's symptoms, so drainage should be performed.

Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (option A) would be useful in patients with suspected biliary obstruction or choledocholithiasis, but there is no indication for this in the patient's presentation. Middle segment pancreatectomy (option C) and distal pancreatectomy (option D) are surgical procedures which would be more invasive than necessary in this situation.

5543,"This patient's rapid pulse, hypotension, worsening shortness of breath, and bilateral wheezing during resuscitation after a traumatic injury are indicative of tension pneumothorax. Trauma patients are at risk of developing tension pneumothorax due to positive pressure ventilation or barotrauma from a primary lung injury, such as a stab wound. A tension pneumothorax occurs when air enters the pleural space and cannot escape, leading to increased intrathoracic pressure, decreased venous return, and decreased cardiac output, presenting as shock (hypotension and tachycardia). As intrathoracic pressure continues to increase, the mediastinum shifts to the contralateral side, further compromising venous return and leading to rapid decompensation and cardiac arrest, as in this patient.

Although the patient has a history of heart failure (Option C), this would not cause the acute decompensation seen here. Heart failure could contribute to a more chronic presentation of dyspnea and hypoxia, but it would not cause the acute changes seen in this patient, such as a rapid pulse, hypotension, and sudden cardiac arrest.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Option B) could also contribute to chronic respiratory symptoms, but it would not cause an acute decompensation and cardiac arrest as seen in this patient.

His temperature is 97.6Â°F (36.4Â°C), blood pressure is 74/34 mmHg, pulse is 180/min, respirations are 24/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient is started on whole blood and the surgeon on call is contacted to take the patient to the operating room. During the secondary survey, the patient complains of shortness of breath. His blood pressure is 54/14 mmHg, pulse is 200/min, respirations are 24/min, and oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. Physical exam is notable for bilateral wheezing on lung exam. The patient goes into cardiac arrest and after 30 minutes, attempts at resuscitation are terminated. Which of the following is associated with this patient's decompensation during resuscitation?

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The most likely cause of the patient's decompensation during resuscitation is E: Persistent intraabdominal bleeding. Given the patient's history of multiple stab wounds and his presentation with hypotension (low blood pressure) and tachycardia (fast heart rate), it's clear that he's in a state of shock, likely due to volume loss from bleeding. Despite receiving whole blood, his condition worsens, indicating ongoing hemorrhage.

A: Congenital long QT syndrome is a cardiac condition that can lead to dangerous arrhythmias, but there's no information in the question stem to suggest that this patient has this disease. 

B: COPD or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a chronic lung condition typically seen in long-term smokers, but the patient's young age and relatively short smoking history make this less likely. Furthermore, COPD doesn't usually lead to acute decompensation and shock.

C: Heart failure can cause low blood pressure and tachycardia, but it wouldn't typically lead to an acute decompensation in response to a stab wound.

D: IgA deficiency is an immunological disorder that can increase susceptibility to infections, particularly of the mucosal surfaces. However, it wouldn't directly lead to hypotensive shock and sudden cardiac arrest in the setting of trauma.

6863,"The most likely causal pathogen in this case is Escherichia coli (Option B). The patient's symptoms of painful urination and urinary frequency suggest a urinary tract infection (UTI). While several organisms can cause UTIs, E. coli is the most common causative agent, responsible for about 85% of uncomplicated UTIs in sexually active women. 

The absence of costovertebral angle tenderness suggests that the infection is limited to the lower urinary tract (i.e., cystitis) rather than the kidneys (i.e., pyelonephritis). The presence of leukocyte esterase on urine dipstick is indicative of pyuria, a common finding in UTIs. The negative Gram stain could be due to the fact that not all bacteria are visible using this stain, or the bacterial concentration in the urine sample was not high enough to detect.

9656,"The answer is B: 'Cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, skeletal muscle'. 

Muscle type X, which demonstrated the highest cytosolic calcium concentration, is indicative of cardiac muscle. Cardiac muscle cells have more sarcoplasmic reticulum, which is responsible for calcium storage, compared to other muscle types. Thus, inhibiting the sarcoplasmic Ca2+ ATPase would lead to an elevated cytosolic calcium concentration.

Muscle types Y and Z, which showed equal but lower cytosolic calcium concentrations than X, are smooth and skeletal muscle. These types of muscle have less sarcoplasmic reticulum and thus less storage for calcium. Hence, when the sarcoplasmic Ca2+ ATPase is inhibited, their cytosolic calcium concentrations would rise but not as much as the cardiac muscle.

To distinguish between the two cell types, the scientists used titin, which is a protein that is primarily found in skeletal and cardiac muscle, but not in smooth muscle. The observation of a luminescent pattern in muscle type Y under microscopy suggests that Y is skeletal muscle (since we already established that X is cardiac muscle). Therefore, Z would be smooth muscle.

All other options are wrong because they do not correctly match the muscle types with the observed results.","stop","the answer is b: 'cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, skeletal muscle'.","B","C","USMLE question: A group of scientists studying the properties of muscle cells in vitro decide to conduct an experiment to observe their distinguishing properties. 3 types of muscle cells isolated from human tissues are labeled as X, Y, and Z and placed in physiological solutions alongside controls Xâ??, Yâ?? and Zâ??. Antibodies against the sarcoplasmic Ca2+ ATPase are added to the solutions containing the experimental group and their cytosolic calcium concentration is compared with their corresponding controls 5 minutes after depolarization. Muscle type X is seen to have the highest cytosolic calcium concentration among the experimental and control groups 5 minutes after depolarization. Muscle types Y and Z, on the other hand, are both observed to have lower, equal cytosolic calcium concentrations but higher than their corresponding controls. To distinguish between the 2 cell types, the scientists tag both cells with a compound capable of fluorescing titin and observes a luminescent pattern in muscle type Y under microscopy. Which of the following set of muscle cell types best describes X, Y, and Z respectively?
Option: {'A': 'Skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, cardiac muscle', 'B': 'Cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, skeletal muscle', 'C': 'Skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, smooth muscle', 'D': 'Smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle', 'E': 'Smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is B: 'Cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, skeletal muscle'. 

Muscle type X shows the highest cytosolic calcium concentration post-depolarization, which is characteristic of cardiac muscle. Cardiac muscle cells have extensive T-tubules and a large sarcoplasmic reticulum that houses a lot of calcium, which is released upon depolarization. The sarcoplasmic Ca2+ ATPase is responsible for actively pumping calcium back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thereby lowering the cytosolic calcium concentration. When antibodies against this enzyme are added, it inhibits the reuptake of calcium, leading to a higher cytosolic calcium concentration, which is observed in muscle type X.

Muscle types Y and Z both have lower, equal cytosolic calcium concentrations, which are however higher than their corresponding controls. This indicates that they have less sarcoplasmic Ca2+ ATPase activity than cardiac muscle, suggesting that they could be smooth and skeletal muscle. The distinguishing factor between these two types of muscle is then the presence of titin ? a protein prominently found in skeletal muscle but absent in smooth muscle. Since muscle type Y shows a luminescent pattern when stained for titin, it suggests that it is skeletal muscle. This leaves muscle type Z to be smooth muscle. 

The other options are incorrect because they do not correctly correlate the experimental observations with the distinguishing characteristics of the three types of muscle cells."
1463,"The correct answer is 'A': Prolactin.

Pituitary adenomas are benign tumors that account for about 10% of intracranial neoplasms. They can cause symptoms either by mass effect (headache, bitemporal hemianopia) or by secreting excess hormone. The most common type of pituitary adenoma is a prolactinoma, which secretes excess prolactin. Hyperprolactinemia can suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to symptoms such as amenorrhea and galactorrhea in women. However, this patient does not present these symptoms which may be due to the fact that she is lactating postpartum and it would be difficult to distinguish between normal and abnormal lactation. Moreover, on a microscopic level, prolactin is secreted by lactotrophs, which are cells that stain basophilic.

As for the other options:
B: Oxytocin is not secreted by the anterior pituitary, but rather, it's produced in the hypothalamus and stored in the posterior pituitary.
C: Growth hormone (GH) also stains basophilic, but GH-secreting adenomas usually present with gigantism or acromegaly, and this patient does not display these signs.
D: Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is also not secreted by the anterior pituitary. It is produced in the hypothalamus and stored in the posterior pituitary.

The patient's symptoms of headaches and bitemporal hemianopsia, along with the finding of an anterior pituitary mass on MRI, are consistent with a pituitary adenoma. Pituitary adenomas can cause symptoms due to mass effect (such as headache and visual field defects) and/or hormone hypersecretion.

The pituitary gland is divided into the anterior and posterior pituitary, each of which secretes different hormones. The anterior pituitary secretes prolactin, growth hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH). Of these, prolactin, growth hormone, and ACTH are basophilic and would uptake a basophilic stain. 

Given the patient's slight excess of a hormone that uptakes a basophilic stain, the possible hormones are prolactin, growth hormone, and ACTH.

78,"This boy's polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, and new-onset enuresis are symptoms of diabetes mellitus. His current presentation of abdominal pain, nausea, tachycardia, tachypnea, and lethargy is consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is a life-threatening complication. DKA is characterized by hyperglycemia, acidemia (decreased bicarbonate), and ketonemia (positive urine ketones). It results from a severe insulin deficiency, and glucose cannot be taken up into cells for use as metabolic fuel. The liver increases production of glucose and ketones, exacerbating the hyperglycemia and acidemia. Hyperglycemia leads to an osmotic diuresis, causing dehydration (manifest as tachycardia, dry mucous membranes) and electrolyte derangements (eg, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia). Therefore, despite the normal glucose threshold for the blood-brain barrier (approximately 180-200 mg/dL), one can expect the serum glucose to be >600 mg/dL (Option E) in DKA.

Option A is incorrect. Total body potassium is usually depleted in DKA due to osmotic diuresis, even though serum levels may be normal or high due to an extracellular shift of potassium caused by acidemia and insulin deficiency.

DKA is characterized by hyperglycemia (serum glucose >250 mg/dL), ketosis, and metabolic acidosis. The clinical features of DKA include polyuria, polydipsia, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, Kussmaul respirations (ie, rapid, deep breathing), and lethargy to coma. The diagnosis of DKA is confirmed by arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showing a low pH (acidemia) and low bicarbonate concentration due to the metabolic acidosis.

10158,"The most likely complication in this patient is 'D': Refeeding syndrome. 

Refeeding syndrome is a potentially lethal condition that can occur when nutrition is reintroduced to malnourished patients (either orally, enterally, or parenterally). This patient is at risk for refeeding syndrome because he was likely undernourished at the time of injury, and received significant resuscitation with fluids and blood products but minimal nutrition during the first few days of hospitalization. When he is started on total parenteral nutrition (TPN), insulin secretion is stimulated in response to increased blood glucose levels. This causes a rapid intracellular shift of potassium, phosphate, and magnesium, leading to severe, life-threatening electrolyte imbalances and fluid shifts.

Option 'A': Cholelithiasis: While TPN can lead to gallstones (cholelithiasis), it typically occurs after a more prolonged course of therapy, not within a few days of initiation.

Option 'B': Hypocalcemia: TPN can cause hypocalcemia, but it is less common and less immediately dangerous than the electrolyte disturbances of refeeding syndrome.

Option 'C': Mesenteric ischemia: While this patient has risk factors for mesenteric ischemia (including shock and abdominal surgery), the initiation of TPN does not specifically increase this risk.

This patient is at risk due to his critical illness and the stress of surgery, both of which increase metabolic demands.

Option 'A' - Cholelithiasis is more associated with rapid weight loss, such as seen in bariatric surgery patients. 

Option 'B' - Hypocalcemia is not directly linked to parenteral nutrition or the mentioned surgery. It can occur due to multiple causes such as vitamin D deficiency, renal failure, or low serum albumin.

Three days ago, she was slide tackled during a game and her leg was struck from the outside. She fell to the ground and sat out for the rest of the game. It was not until yesterday that she noticed swelling in her knee. She also feels as if her knee is unstable and does not feel confident bearing weight on her leg during athletic activities. Her past medical history is notable for asthma, which is currently treated with an albuterol inhaler. On physical exam, you note bruising over her leg, knee, and lateral thigh, and edema of her knee. Passive range of motion of the knee is notable only for minor clicking and catching of the joint. The patient's gait appears normal, though the patient states that her injured knee does not feel stable. Further physical exam is performed and imaging is ordered.

ACL tears occur frequently in athletes and often result from a non-contact injury involving rapid deceleration and change in direction, as well as from a direct blow to the lateral aspect of the knee, as seen in this patient's history. The key features of an ACL tear include acute onset of swelling (due to a hemarthrosis) within a few hours of injury and a sensation of instability or ""giving way"".

Option B, a Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) tear, is less likely as these are usually due to a direct blow to the anterior tibia with the knee flexed (e.g., dashboard injury). They are less common than ACL tears and do not typically cause instability.

Option C, a Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL) tear would more likely present with medial-sided knee pain and swelling, and would likely be due to a direct lateral force to the knee, which is not described in this case.

Option D, a Medial Meniscal tear, typically present with joint line pain, swelling, or mechanical symptoms (eg, locking, popping), but the history of a traumatic injury with symptoms of instability makes an ACL tear more likely.

9046,"The correct answer is C. 'Triple test'. 

In pregnant women with poor glycemic control, such as this patient who has a high HbA1c of 8.3%, there is an increased risk of congenital anomalies, especially cardiac and neural tube defects. Hence, it's important to perform a triple test (also known as multiple marker screening), which assesses the levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and unconjugated estriol in maternal serum. Abnormal levels of these markers can suggest the presence of neural tube defects or chromosomal abnormalities.

1318,"The correct option is 'B': 'III, IV'.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), which, like acute rheumatic fever, is an immunologically mediated complication of group A streptococcal infection. APSGN typically presents 1-2 weeks after a pharyngeal infection or 3-6 weeks after a skin infection (eg, impetigo) with group A streptococci. Symptoms include hematuria (red urine), edema (swollen face), and hypertension. APSGN and acute rheumatic fever occur due to molecular mimicry, in which the immune system makes antibodies against the bacterial antigens, which cross-react with self-antigens in the kidneys and heart, respectively, triggering an autoimmune response.

Polyarteritis nodosa is a medium vessel vasculitis that is often associated with hepatitis B or C infection, not group A streptococcal infection. The Arthus reaction is a type III hypersensitivity reaction characterized by local vasculitis due to antigen-antibody complex deposition and activation of complement, which is similar to APSGN, but it is a local reaction rather than a systemic one.

Myasthenia gravis is a type II hypersensitivity reaction in which antibodies are directed against acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, resulting in muscle weakness, not organ-specific damage like in APSGN or acute rheumatic fever.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the joints. Although it is autoimmune in nature, it is not post-infectious or caused by molecular mimicry.

The patient?s recent history of streptococcal pharyngitis (sandpaper rash and strawberry tongue) and current findings of facial swelling, irritability, hematuria, and low C3 are suggestive of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). PSGN is a type III hypersensitivity reaction to streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin. It is characterized by deposition of immune complexes in the glomeruli, which in turn triggers complement activation and inflammation. This is the same mechanism of injury seen in acute rheumatic fever (an autoimmune response to group A streptococcus infection) and in polyarteritis nodosa (an immune complex-mediated vasculitis), making option B (III, IV) the correct answer.

779,"The answer is 'C: Heterochromatin'. 

Heterochromatin is a tightly packed form of DNA, which is associated with lower levels of gene expression. This is because the tight configuration of heterochromatin makes it difficult for the cell's machinery to access the DNA to transcribe it into RNA. However, if a cell has a lot of heterochromatin, it might be a sign that it's not regulating its gene expression properly. This can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and division, which are hallmarks of cancer.

Option 'A: Euchromatin' is a more loosely packed form of DNA that is associated with higher levels of gene expression. However, this is not inherently linked to cancer. 

Option 'B: Nucleosomes' are the basic units of DNA packaging, consisting of a segment of DNA wound around eight histone proteins. While changes in nucleosome structure can affect gene expression, they are not directly linked to cancer risk.

Option 'D: H1 protein' is a type of histone protein that plays a role in DNA packaging. Like nucleosomes, changes in H1 protein can affect gene expression, but they are not directly linked to cancer risk.

Option 'E: Methylated DNA' refers to the addition of a methyl group to the DNA molecule, which can affect gene expression. DNA methylation is a normal process and is not inherently linked to cancer. However, abnormal DNA methylation patterns can contribute to cancer development. But without further context, it cannot be stated that it is most closely associated with an increased potential for malignancy. 

Therefore, out of the options provided, 'C: Heterochromatin' is the one most closely associated with an increased potential for malignancy.","stop","the answer is 'c: heterochromatin'.","C","A","USMLE question: A research lab is investigating the rate of replication of a variety of human cells in order to better understand cancer metastasis.

By contrast, the other options listed are not as closely associated with an increased potential for malignancy:

A: Euchromatin is a lightly packed form of chromatin (DNA, RNA, and protein) that is rich in gene concentration and is often under active transcription. It is not specifically associated with cancer.

B: Nucleosomes are the basic units of DNA packaging, consisting of a segment of DNA wound around histone proteins. While changes in nucleosome positioning and structure can occur in cancer, they are not usually directly implicated in the development or progression of malignancy.

5694,"The correct answer is B: Atrial fibrillation.

This patient's symptoms of anxiety, insomnia, heat intolerance, weight loss, and a palpable neck mass are suggestive of hyperthyroidism. The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves' disease, which is an autoimmune disorder that causes the production of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins. These antibodies bind to and activate the TSH receptor, leading to an unregulated overproduction of thyroid hormone. However, this patient has a palpable neck mass and her family member suggested that her condition might be due to somatic activating mutations of the TSH receptor gene, which is characteristic of toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter. 

Additional findings that would raise concern for a different underlying cause of her hyperthyroidism include atrial fibrillation (option B). Atrial fibrillation is a common complication of hyperthyroidism; however, it is more commonly associated with thyrotoxicosis secondary to thyroiditis or exogenous thyroid hormone ingestion. 

Options A (Nonpitting edema), C (Hyperreflexia), D (Lid lag), and E (Fine tremor) are all symptoms commonly associated with hyperthyroidism and do not suggest a different etiology.

Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder in which stimulating antibodies bind to the TSH (thyrotropin) receptor, resulting in increased thyroid hormone production, is the most common cause of endogenous hyperthyroidism. Other symptoms include hyperactivity, emotional lability, and hyperdefecation. Physical findings include warm, moist skin; a diffusely enlarged, nontender thyroid gland; stare due to eyelid retraction (lid lag); pretibial myxedema (nonpitting edema); and proximal muscle weakness. A fine, rapid tremor and hyperreflexia due to increased beta-adrenergic activity can also be present. 

However, the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) (option B) in a relatively young person with hyperthyroidism should raise concern for toxic multinodular goiter (TMNG) or functioning thyroid adenoma, rather than Graves disease. Unlike Graves disease, these conditions are not autoimmune in nature but rather are caused by somatic activating mutations of the gene for the TSH receptor within the thyroid gland. The increased thyroid hormone production in these conditions is independent of TSH stimulation. TMNG and thyroid adenoma tend to occur in older individuals and can have a more subtle clinical presentation than Graves disease. AF and weight loss are more common in TMNG and adenoma than in Graves disease.

This can help stabilize the heart rhythm and prevent arrhythmias.

Option 'B': Mexiletine is a class IB antiarrhythmic drug, which actually speeds up the phase 0 upstroke and shortens the duration of the action potential, opposite to the effects desired in the question. 

Option 'C': Procainamide is a class IA antiarrhythmic drug, which does slow the phase 0 upstroke, but it also prolongs the refractory period by blocking potassium channels, which can potentially lead to a longer QT interval and potentially torsades de pointes.

Option A, Esophageal branch of thoracic aorta, is incorrect as these vessels usually derive from the thoracic aorta and run along the esophagus, though they are smaller and less significant compared to the bronchial arteries.

Option B, Left inferior phrenic artery, is incorrect because this artery supplies the diaphragm and has a small esophageal branch but is located inferiorly and would not typically be at risk during surgery for an upper esophageal mass.

Option C, The inferior thyroid artery, is incorrect because this artery is located in the neck and supplies the thyroid gland. It is unlikely to be damaged during surgery on the upper part of the esophagus, which is located in the thoracic cavity.

Option D, Left gastric artery, is incorrect as it arises from the celiac trunk to supply the lesser curvature of the stomach and the lower part of the esophagus. This would not be at risk during surgery for an upper esophageal mass.

1374,"The patient's presentation with a wide fixed split second heart sound and a systolic ejection murmur along the upper left sternal border are indicative of an atrial septal defect (ASD). ASDs, particularly the ostium secundum variety, are relatively common congenital heart diseases that may not present until adolescence or early adulthood. Shunting of blood from the left atrium to the right atrium causes volume overload on the right side of the heart, leading to right atrial and right ventricular enlargement. As a result, these patients often have a prominent right heart border on chest x-ray and increased right ventricular end-diastolic dimension on echocardiography (option A is wrong).

The wide fixed split second heart sound is due to the delayed closure of the pulmonic valve secondary to prolonged right ventricular ejection time. This is typically constant in all respiratory cycles (inspiration and expiration). The systolic ejection murmur heard along the upper left sternal border is due to increased flow across the pulmonic valve. A mid-diastolic rumble (due to increased flow across the tricuspid valve) may also be audible.

A medium-pitched systolic ejection murmur is present which is best heard at the left middle and upper sternal border. A short mid-diastolic rumble is also audible over the lower left sternal border, which is best heard with the bell of the stethoscope. Which of the following findings is most likely to be present on this patientâ??s echocardiogram?
Option: {'A': 'Decreased right ventricular end-diastolic dimension', 'B': 'Anterior movement of ventricular septum during systole', 'C': 'Goose-neck deformity of left ventricular outflow tract', 'D': 'Increased left ventricular shortening fraction', 'E': 'Displacement of tricuspid valve leaflets inferiorly into right ventricle'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The patient's symptoms of easy fatigability and exercise intolerance along with physical examination findings of a wide fixed split second heart sound, systolic ejection murmur at the left middle and upper sternal border and a mid-diastolic rumble at lower left sternal border are characteristic of an atrial septal defect (ASD), particularly a secundum ASD (option E). In an ASD, oxygenated blood shunts from the left atrium to the right atrium due to a defect in the interatrial septum. Over time, this results in right-sided volume overload, leading to right atrial and right ventricular enlargement and increased flow across the pulmonic valve (manifesting as a systolic ejection murmur). The increased flow through the tricuspid valve can result in a mid-diastolic rumble. ASDs also cause a wide, fixed splitting of S2. This occurs because the extra blood in the right heart delays closure of the pulmonic valve.

The other options do not accurately represent the findings in ASD:
Option A: Right ventricular end-diastolic dimension would actually be increased due to increased blood flow from left to right atrial shunting.
Option B: Anterior movement of the ventricular septum during systole is characteristic of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, not ASD.
Option C: A ""gooseneck"" deformity of the left ventricular outflow tract is typically seen in patients with congenital mitral stenosis, not ASD.
Option D: Left ventricular shortening fraction would not be directly impacted by an ASD, which primarily affects right heart structures."
1486,"This patient's long-term smoking history, chronic cough with sputum production, shortness of breath, and findings of wheezing with a prolonged expiratory phase are indicative of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. It is most often caused by long-term exposure to irritating gases or particulate matter, most commonly from cigarette smoke. Chest radiograph findings in COPD patients are typically 'hyperinflated lungs' with loss of lung markings due to the destruction of alveolar walls, which is consistent with emphysema, a component of COPD. Therefore, Option 'C' is the correct answer.

Now, let's review why the other options are wrong:

Option 'A': Calcified pleural plaques surrounding the diaphragm is typically seen in patients with exposure to asbestos, which this patient does not report.

Option 'B': Cardiomegaly and increased bronchial markings is characteristic of congestive heart failure. While this patient does have some signs of fluid overload (eg, edema, weight gain), the primary issue appears to be respiratory in nature.

Option 'D': A perihilar mass with unilateral hilar enlargement would suggest lung cancer, but this patient's symptoms are more consistent with COPD. While he does have a significant smoking history (which increases the risk of lung cancer), the lack of symptoms such as hemoptysis, chest pain, or weight loss makes malignancy less likely.

Option 'E': Subpleural cystic enlargement is typically seen in patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis, a rare disease that mainly affects young adults and involves the formation of granulomas in various organs.

On chest radiograph, findings in COPD would typically include hyperinflated lungs and loss of lung markings, corresponding to option 'C'. 

Let's analyze why the other options are wrong:
Option 'A' is suggestive of asbestosis which typically occurs in individuals with occupational exposure to asbestos, such as construction workers or ship yard workers. 
Option 'B' is suggestive of congestive heart failure (CHF), which can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath and edema, but does not typically cause chronic cough with sputum production.
Option 'D' is suggestive of lung cancer, which can definitely occur in a long-term smoker. However, his symptoms are more consistent with COPD rather than lung cancer.
Option 'E' is suggestive of lymphangioleiomyomatosis or Langerhans cell histiocytosis which are rare diseases and not likely in this patient without any specific symptoms suggestive of these diseases.

5264,"The most likely cause of this patient's findings is 'Parathyroid adenoma' (Option E).

This patient's elevated serum calcium and PTH levels, along with his familial history of hyperparathyroidism, are suggestive of a parathyroid adenoma. Parathyroid adenomas are benign tumors that secrete PTH, resulting in elevated serum calcium levels. The fact that his mother had a parathyroidectomy in her 30s suggests a possible genetic predisposition to the condition.

'Excess calcium intake' (Option A) could potentially raise serum calcium levels, but it would not result in elevated PTH levels.

'Abnormal calcium sensing receptors' (Option B) could potentially result in elevated PTH levels, but this would not typically cause elevated serum calcium levels.

'Excess vitamin D intake' (Option C) could also potentially raise serum calcium levels, but again, it would not result in elevated PTH levels.

'Lithium toxicity' (Option D) can cause hypercalcemia by enhancing the release of PTH. However, the lithium level is not provided here, and the patient does not show any signs of lithium toxicity. Additionally, the degree of hypercalcemia in lithium-induced hyperparathyroidism is usually mild.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The most likely cause of this patientâ??s findings is a parathyroid adenoma (E). The combination of hypercalcemia and elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) suggests primary hyperparathyroidism, the most common cause of which is a single parathyroid adenoma. The fact that the patient's mother had a parathyroidectomy suggests a possible genetic component. In addition, the patient is on lithium for bipolar disorder, which has been associated with hyperparathyroidism, possibly due to an effect on the calcium-sensing receptor that results in increased PTH secretion. 

'A' is incorrect because excess calcium intake (eg, calcium supplements, antacids) can cause hypercalciuria but would not cause hypercalcemia unless renal function is compromised. 

'B' is incorrect because abnormal calcium sensing receptors would lead to familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, but this option is less likely because the patient's mother had a parathyroidectomy, which is not usually required in familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.

'C' is incorrect because while excessive intake of Vitamin D can cause hypercalcemia, it does this by increasing absorption of calcium from the gut and reabsorption of calcium in the kidney. This would lead to hypercalciuria, not hypocalciuria as seen in this patient.

'D' is incorrect because while lithium can cause hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia, it is not due to toxicity. Rather, lithium can increase set point of calcium-sensing receptor in parathyroid cells, leading to increased PTH release.

9056,"The correct answer is E. Sensory loss to the dorsal surface of the foot and part of the anterior lower and lateral leg and foot drop.

A traumatic hip dislocation can damage the sciatic nerve which runs close to the hip joint. The sciatic nerve is a major nerve that innervates the lower limb. It has two major branches: the tibial nerve and the common peroneal nerve (also known as the common fibular nerve). Damage to the common peroneal nerve branch of the sciatic nerve can cause foot drop (inability to dorsiflex the foot) and sensory loss in its distribution (dorsal surface of the foot and part of the anterior lower and lateral leg).

Sensory innervation includes the entire lower leg and foot except the medial aspect, which is supplied by the saphenous nerve (branch of the femoral nerve). Common peroneal nerve injury can lead to foot drop (loss of dorsiflexion), loss of sensation on the dorsal foot, and inability to evert the foot.

However, his negative PPD and the presence of partially acid-fast, gram-positive branching rods on bronchoalveolar lavage indicate infection with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), not Mycobacterium tuberculosis. MAC is an opportunistic infection occurring in HIV patients when their CD4 count falls below 50 cell/mm^3. Pulmonary disease due to MAC can resemble TB with upper lobe cavitary disease. Treatment for disseminated MAC or MAC lung disease in HIV-infected patients consists of a macrolide (either azithromycin or clarithromycin) plus ethambutol.

9972,"The most likely cause of this patient's presentation is 'D: Exposure to bacteria at school.' The symptoms of high fever, sore throat, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea are suggestive of a bacterial infection, likely Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), which is a common cause of bloody diarrhea in children. The fact that several other children at the patient's preschool have similar symptoms supports the likelihood of a bacterial outbreak at the school.

While 'A: The new dog' could theoretically be a source of certain infections (such as Campylobacter), it is less likely given the concurrent outbreak of similar symptoms in other children at the patient's preschool. Dogs do not typically carry STEC.

'B: A recent antibiotic prescription' might cause diarrhea, but it would typically not cause bloody diarrhea, high fever, or vomiting. Antibiotics can disrupt the normal gut flora and lead to overgrowth of certain bacteria such as Clostridioides difficile, which can cause pseudomembranous colitis. However, this condition is rare in children and the history does not suggest recent antibiotic use.

'C: Reheated fried rice' is associated with Bacillus cereus food poisoning, which typically presents with either vomiting (from preformed toxin in the food) or non-bloody diarrhea (from toxin produced in the intestines after ingestion), but not both. Moreover, B. cereus food poisoning does not cause fever or bloody diarrhea.

300,"The correct answer is A: Tamsulosin. 

Tamsulosin is an alpha-1 blocker used primarily to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which this patient has. It works by relaxing the muscles in the prostate and the bladder neck, allowing urine to flow out of the bladder more easily. This would help reduce the frequency with which the patient needs to urinate at night.

Option B: Finasteride is incorrect. Finasteride is a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor that is also used to treat BPH, but it has a slower onset of action and is therefore not the best initial treatment choice. 

Option C: Prazosin is an alpha blocker like Tamsulosin, but it is not specifically indicated for BPH and has more systemic effects, such as lowering blood pressure. This can be particularly risky in a patient with a history of symptomatic hypotension and syncope.

Option D: Tadalafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor. It is used to treat erectile dysfunction and can also be used to treat BPH, but Tamsulosin is generally preferred as first-line therapy.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","Option A, Tamsulosin, is the best choice in this case. This medication is an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, which functions by relaxing smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, thereby alleviating urinary symptoms including frequency, urgency and nocturia. Importantly, this drug is selective for the alpha-1A receptor subtype that is predominant in the prostate, which minimizes the risk of hypotension, a known side effect of nonselective alpha blockers.

Option B, Finasteride, is a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor that shrinks the prostate by blocking the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. It is also used in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), but it takes several months to take effect and is therefore not the best initial treatment choice.

Option C, Prazosin, is a non-selective alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist used for hypertension and BPH. However, due to the patient's history of symptomatic hypotension and syncope, this would not be the best choice as it may exacerbate these conditions.

1095,"The most likely diagnosis in this patient is abscess due to Entamoeba histolytica (choice E). This patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, fever, and right upper quadrant tenderness along with a liver abscess on ultrasound are suggestive of amebic liver abscess, which is the most common extraintestinal manifestation of E. histolytica. Ingestion of E. histolytica cysts can cause an asymptomatic intestinal infection or amebic dysentery, which may be followed weeks to months later by extraintestinal disease. Risk factors include travel to an endemic area, such as Mexico, and male sex. Although E. histolytica is primarily transmitted via the fecal-oral route, sexual transmission (particularly in men who have sex with men) has been described.

Echinococcus granulosus (choice C) can also cause liver cysts, but these tend to be larger and more well-defined than in amebic abscess, and they are associated with exposure to dogs and sheep rather than the risk factors present in this patient.

The patient's history of recent travel to Mexico, a developing country where Entamoeba histolytica infection is endemic, and the presence of liver abscess on imaging studies are highly suggestive of amebic liver abscess. Entamoeba histolytica causes amebiasis, which can present with symptoms ranging from asymptomatic cyst passage to invasive disease, including fulminant colitis and extraintestinal disease. The most common form of extraintestinal disease is amebic liver abscess. Patients typically present with right upper quadrant pain, fever, and hepatomegaly. Lab studies often show leukocytosis.

The goal LDL for patients with established CAD is <70 mg/dL. Therefore, starting a high-intensity statin (eg, atorvastatin, rosuvastatin) is the appropriate next step in management. The most common adverse effects of statins include asymptomatic elevation of hepatic transaminases and myopathy. Hepatotoxicity is typically mild and dose-dependent, with a frequency of 0.5%-2%. It is usually detected through routine monitoring within the first 3 months of therapy. Therefore, option C (Elevated transaminases) is the correct answer.

193,"The patient in the question is most likely suffering from acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), a condition characterized by neurovisceral symptoms like abdominal pain, neuropathy, and mental status changes. Dark urine in AIP is caused by excess urinary porphobilinogen.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is A. Aminolevulinate dehydratase.

This patient's symptoms of dark urine, abdominal pain, and peripheral neuropathy in conjunction with a history of phenytoin use suggest an attack of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). AIP is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a deficiency of porphobilinogen deaminase, which is involved in the heme synthesis pathway. This leads to an accumulation of upstream metabolites, particularly aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen. However, the neurologic manifestations seen in AIP (eg, neuropathy, neuropsychiatric symptoms) are believed to be caused by ALA.

During an acute attack, glucose and hemin (a heme analogue) are administered. Glucose administration helps by inducing insulin secretion, which decreases ALA synthase expression. Hemin works by inhibiting ALA synthase-1, the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the heme synthesis pathway in the liver. By suppressing the heme synthesis pathway, hemin reduces the accumulation of neurotoxic precursors (eg, ALA).

The other enzymes listed are also involved in the heme synthesis pathway, but are not specifically targeted for inhibition in the treatment of acute AIP:
- ALA synthase (Option B) is the enzyme inhibited by hemin and glucose to prevent further accumulation of porphyrins and precursors.
- Ferrochelatase (Option C) and uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (Option E) deficiencies are associated with different types of porphyria (eg, erythropoietic protoporphyria and porphyria cutanea tarda, respectively), not AIP.
- Porphobilinogen deaminase (Option D) is deficient in AIP; however, the treatment is not aimed at inhibiting this enzyme."

SJS is a rare, serious disorder of the skin and mucous membranes, and is usually a reaction to a medication or an infection. The urinary tract infection and subsequent use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in this patient likely precipitated the development of SJS. The characteristic features include a prodrome of fever and malaise, followed by the development of painful mucosal erosions and cutaneous vesicles/bullae that eventually rupture and lead to skin detachment. The severity of SJS is determined by the extent of skin detachment: <10% body surface area (BSA) is SJS, 10-30% BSA is SJS/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) overlap, and >30% BSA is TEN. The diagnosis of SJS is made clinically with the aid of skin biopsy showing full-thickness epidermal necrosis and a sparse dermal infiltrate. Direct immunofluorescence is usually negative.

Option A - Gram stain and culture of skin sample would be more appropriate in a suspected skin infection, not in SJS.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's history of type II diabetes, altered mental status, and laboratory findings of anion gap metabolic acidosis (HCO3-: 16 mEq/L), hyperglycemia (Glucose: 202 mg/dL), and renal insufficiency (Creatinine: 2.7 mg/dL) are suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is a medical emergency that typically presents with polyuria, polydipsia, abdominal pain, vomiting, and altered mental status. The most common precipitant is infection, but other causes include medication noncompliance, myocardial infarction, and stroke. 

The mainstays of DKA treatment are intravenous fluids, insulin, electrolyte repletion (especially potassium), and treatment of the underlying precipitant. 

Insulin therapy (Option A) is needed to suppress hepatic glucose production and lipolysis and to stimulate glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue. However, insulin therapy alone could lead to hypokalemia, as insulin shifts potassium into cells and thus lowers plasma potassium concentrations. 

Potassium repletion (Option B) is necessary to correct the total body potassium deficit that is common in DKA. However, potassium repletion alone would not address the underlying metabolic derangement.

Bicarbonate (Option C) is generally not recommended for treatment of DKA. 

Discontinuing the patient's home medications (Option E) would not address the acute metabolic derangement and could worsen his long-term glucose control.

Combining insulin and potassium (Option D) allows for correcting the metabolic derangement and preventing hypokalemia, thus it represents the best next step in management."
9345,"The most likely diagnosis in this patient with third-trimester bleeding and a history of two cesarean sections is placenta previa. Placenta previa, characterized by implantation of the placenta over the cervical os, is associated with risk factors such as prior cesarean section, multiparity, advanced maternal age, and smoking. Classic symptoms include painless third-trimester bleeding. Diagnosis of placenta previa is made by ultrasound, which can differentiate between placenta previa and other causes of third-trimester bleeding such as placental abruption or vasa previa. A transabdominal ultrasound (choice D) is usually the first imaging modality used to diagnose placenta previa. If a transabdominal ultrasound is inconclusive, a transvaginal ultrasound (choice A) can be performed for a more detailed view of the placenta in relation to the cervix.

Digital cervical examination (Choice B) is contraindicated in patients with suspected placenta previa due to the risk of inducing severe, potentially life-threatening bleeding.

9752,"The clinical scenario presents a patient with risk factors for coronary artery disease (ie, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking) who has new-onset epigastric pain and nausea. Although this presentation may suggest gastrointestinal pathology, such as peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, the patient's age and risk factors should also raise suspicion for acute myocardial ischemia, which can present with epigastric discomfort and nausea/vomiting rather than the classic symptoms of chest pain or shortness of breath. Therefore, given that the patient's symptoms are due to acute myocardial ischemia, the most likely cardiac examination finding is a ventricular gallop (Option B).

A ventricular gallop, also known as an S3, is a low-frequency sound best heard at the cardiac apex in early diastole, just after the rapid filling phase of the left ventricle. It is associated with increased filling pressures (as in heart failure) and more compliant ventricles (as in young people). An S3 is a classic sign of heart failure but is also often heard in patients with acute myocardial infarction.

Given that the pain is intermittent and not persistent, perforation is less likely. However, the absence of vomiting does not rule out gastric outlet obstruction. This could cause her to have a ventricular gallop (option B) due to volume depletion from poor oral intake or vomiting, if present. A ventricular gallop, or third heart sound (S3), is associated with increased left ventricular filling pressure (eg, due to heart failure) and more rapid deceleration of early diastolic filling.

964,"The correct answer is A. Tensor tympani. 

This patient's symptoms of unilateral facial weakness with sound intolerance (hyperacusis) suggest a lesion involving the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII). The facial nerve provides motor innervation to the muscles of facial expression, which accounts for the patient's facial droop and ptosis. It also carries parasympathetic fibers to several skull base structures, including the lacrimal and salivary glands and the tensor tympani muscle of the middle ear. Paralysis of the tensor tympani muscle can cause hyperacusis due to loss of the dampening effect on loud noises normally exerted by this muscle.

The facial nerve provides motor innervation to the stapedius muscle in the middle ear, which contracts to dampen loud sounds. Injury to the facial nerve can result in stapedius muscle paralysis and subsequent hyperacusis. The facial nerve also provides sensory innervation to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and parasympathetic innervation to the lacrimal, submandibular, and sublingual glands.

2340,"The correct answer is D. 'Immediate laparotomy'. 

The patient in this scenario has sustained a gunshot wound to the abdomen, which is a clear indication for immediate surgical intervention, specifically exploratory laparotomy, given the high risk of intra-abdominal injury. Penetrating abdominal trauma, especially those caused by high-velocity weapons like guns, are likely to cause significant damage to intra-abdominal structures even if initial physical examination and vital signs are relatively reassuring. 

Option A, 'CT scan of the abdomen' is incorrect. Although CT scan is a vital tool in evaluating blunt abdominal trauma, it is typically not used in cases of penetrating trauma when signs of peritonitis, hemodynamic instability, or evisceration are present because these findings indicate a clear need for surgical intervention.

Option B, 'Close observation' is incorrect. This approach might be appropriate in selected patients with penetrating wounds to the anterior abdominal wall who are completely asymptomatic with a reliable physical examination. However, given the trajectory of the bullet (from the right upper quadrant to the right lower back), significant intra-abdominal injury is highly likely and therefore observation would not be appropriate.

Option C, 'Diagnostic laparoscopy' is incorrect. Although laparoscopy can be used in selected cases, gunshot wounds usually cause multiple and extensive injuries that are better explored with laparotomy. 

Option E, 'Diagnostic peritoneal lavage' is incorrect. This procedure is largely of historical interest and has been replaced by focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) and CT scan in most trauma centers because these imaging modalities provide more detailed information.

Damage to the optic chiasm can result in visual field defects, the most common of which is bitemporal hemianopsia.

Option: {'A': 'Endoscopy only', 'B': 'Colonoscopy only', 'C': 'Endoscopy and colonoscopy', 'D': 'Iron supplementation', 'E': 'Transfusion'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is B: Colonoscopy only.

This patient's positive fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and history of a first-degree relative with colorectal cancer (CRC) are concerning for colorectal malignancy, of which anemia is a common paraneoplastic syndrome. The anemia in CRC is typically normocytic and normochromic, but in advanced disease, it can be microcytic and hypochromic due to chronic blood loss resulting in iron deficiency. Therefore, these findings warrant further investigation with colonoscopy, which is the most sensitive test for detecting colorectal polyps and cancer.

Option A: Endoscopy only would be incorrect because it would not provide visualization of the colon where the suspected malignancy is likely located.

Option C: Endoscopy and colonoscopy might seem like a good option, given the patient's iron deficiency anemia (which could signal an upper gastrointestinal source of blood loss). However, given the patient's personal history and positive FOBT, colonoscopy should be the first test. If negative, it may then be appropriate to perform endoscopy.

Option D: Iron supplementation may be necessary to correct the patient's iron deficiency anemia, but it does not address the underlying issue likely causing the anemia, which is the suspected colorectal malignancy.

Option E: Transfusion is generally reserved for patients with severe anemia causing symptoms such as chest pain, syncope, or heart failure. This patient's hemoglobin level, while low, is not low enough to warrant transfusion in the absence of such symptoms. Transfusion also does not address the likely underlying issue."
5681,"This patient's diarrhea after a course of antibiotics suggests Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). CDI results from disruption of the normal intestinal flora, often due to antibiotics, which allows for overgrowth of C difficile, a gram-positive, toxin-producing bacillus. C difficile toxins cause mucosal inflammation and damage that can lead to watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and leukocytosis. In severe cases, pseudomembranous colitis and toxic megacolon can develop. The diagnosis of CDI is confirmed by testing stool for C difficile toxins or a molecular test that detects the toxin genes. 

First-line treatment for an initial episode of nonsevere or severe CDI (defined by white blood cell count <15,000/mm3 and serum creatinine <1.5 times baseline) is oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin (Options B and C). Oral route is preferred because C difficile is a luminal pathogen; vancomycin given orally achieves high intraluminal concentrations. Metronidazole (Option A) is inferior to vancomycin and fidaxomicin and is now recommended only when these agents are unavailable or not tolerated. Rifaximin (Option D) is not recommended for initial treatment of CDI. Intravenous metronidazole (Option E) is poorly secreted into the gastrointestinal tract and is not recommended for initial therapy, but it may be added to oral vancomycin in critically ill patients with fulminant colitis.

Therefore, both oral vancomycin and fidaxomicin are correct answers, but because oral fidaxomicin (Option C) is more cost-effective and associated with fewer recurrences, it is often preferred.","stop","therefore, both oral vancomycin and fidaxomicin are correct answers, but because oral fidaxomicin (option c) is more cost-effective and associated with fewer recurrences, it is often preferred.","C","C","USMLE question: A 42-year-old man with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus is admitted to the hospital because of swelling and redness of the left leg for 3 days.

Option: {'A': 'Oral metronidazole', 'B': 'Intravenous vancomycin', 'C': 'Oral fidaxomicin', 'D': 'Oral rifaximin', 'E': 'Intravenous metronidazole'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The patient's recent hospitalization, antibiotic use, and symptoms of profuse, foul-smelling watery diarrhea suggest antibiotic-associated diarrhea due to Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection. This infection typically occurs due to disruption of the normal intestinal flora by antibiotics, allowing for overgrowth of C. diff. Clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and penicillins are most commonly associated with C. diff infections. Diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of C. diff toxins A and B in stool.

The initial treatment for C. diff infection includes discontinuing the inciting antibiotic, if possible, and starting oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin. Metronidazole is less effective and is no longer recommended as initial therapy for C. diff infection, but can be used if other treatments are unavailable. 

So, the most appropriate therapy would be either oral vancomycin (Option B) or oral fidaxomicin (Option C). However, in this scenario given the options, we would go with oral vancomycin (Option B) because it is the standard initial therapy for C. diff infection and is more cost-effective than fidaxomicin.

Oral rifaximin (Option D) is used in the management of hepatic encephalopathy and traveler's diarrhea but not C. diff infection. Intravenous metronidazole (Option E) is inferior to oral vancomycin for initial therapy of severe C. diff infection and is used only when oral therapies cannot be given."
2214,"The most likely diagnosis is 'E' Bone metastases. The clinical features of bone pain, a history of cancer, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and a new fracture in a weight-bearing vertebra in an older patient strongly suggest metastatic bone disease.

This patient's history of breast cancer, new onset lower back pain, and an isolated elevation in her alkaline phosphatase (ALP) with a normal gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) are concerning for bone metastases. Bone is the third most common site of metastasis (following lung and liver) for many malignancies, including breast cancer. Back pain is a common symptom of vertebral metastases and may occur because of pathologic fracture, which seems to be the case in this patient, or spinal cord compression. ALP is often elevated in patients with bone metastases because it is produced by osteoblasts, which are stimulated when there is increased bone turnover, as can occur in malignancies of the bone. GGT, while also a marker of cholestasis, is more specific for biliary origin when elevated in conjunction with ALP, which is not the case in this patient.

Type 1 osteopetrosis (Choice A) is a genetic disorder that presents in childhood with pancytopenia, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and cranial nerve deficits due to bone overgrowth. Primary biliary cholangitis (Choice B) typically presents in middle-aged women with pruritus, jaundice, and hepatomegaly and is characterized by elevation in both ALP and GGT. Rheumatoid arthritis (Choice C) would manifest primarily as joint complaints, not lower back pain, and would not explain the elevated ALP.

The patient's sputum culture results (aerobic, non-lactose fermenting, oxidase-positive, gram-negative bacillus) are indicative of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that covers Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common pathogen in cystic fibrosis patients with pulmonary symptoms.

Option A: Amoxicillin and clavulanic acid is incorrect because it does not have activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Option B: Postural drainage of the chest might be beneficial for cystic fibrosis patients to help clear mucus from the lungs, but it does not treat the underlying infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

This patient's sputum culture is characteristic of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an aerobic, non-lactose fermenting, oxidase-positive, gram-negative bacillus that is a common cause of chronic pulmonary infections in patients with cystic fibrosis. Pseudomonas species are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics, and treatment often requires combination antibiotic therapy, including an aminoglycoside (e.g. tobramycin) and an antipseudomonal beta-lactam (e.g. piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime).

However, despite the identification of Pseudomonas, the most effective treatment regimen for a cystic fibrosis patient with chronic cough and sputum production does not necessarily include immediate antibiotics. The mainstay of management in cystic fibrosis is chest physiotherapy to help clear the thick mucus from the airways. Techniques include postural drainage, percussion, and vibration, as well as the use of devices that create positive expiratory pressure. This approach reduces the risk of infection by preventing mucus from accumulating and serving as a growth medium for bacteria.

Options A, D, and E (Amoxicillin/clavulanate, Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and IV ciprofloxacin) are all antibiotics, and while chronic Pseudomonas infection in cystic fibrosis does often require antibiotic treatment, the first-line strategy is chest physiotherapy.

A) Diabetes mellitus is associated with a number of complications, but it is not specifically associated with gallstones. 

B) Primary hyperparathyroidism can cause hypercalcemia, which can lead to calcium-based gallstones. However, these form a much smaller percentage of gallstones compared to cholesterol stones.

C) Chronic hemolytic anemia can cause pigment gallstones due to the increased turnover of red blood cells and subsequent increased bilirubin load for the liver to process. However, these usually appear as dark, radio-opaque stones on imaging.

445,"This patient's presentation of severe abdominal pain, neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., disorientation, auditory hallucinations), and motor neuropathy after a recent alcohol binge is consistent with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). AIP is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by a deficiency in porphobilinogen deaminase. Symptoms are precipitated by drugs (e.g., cytochrome P450 inducers, steroids), fasting, and hormonal changes. Neurologic findings can include peripheral neuropathy (motor > sensory) and central nervous system disturbances (e.g., confusion, hallucinations, seizures). Abdominal pain is typically severe and accompanied by autonomic disturbances (eg, tachycardia, hypertension).

The most common cardiac manifestation, MVP, may cause chest pain and dyspnea similar to the symptoms in this patient.

On physical examination, MVP is characterized by a midsystolic click followed by a late systolic, crescendo murmur. The midsystolic click is due to the sudden tensing of the mitral valve leaflets and chordae tendineae after prolapse into the left atrium during systole. The murmur is due to blood regurgitating through the prolapsed mitral valve.

7909,"This patient's presentation of fatigue, hypertension, polyuria, constipation, and depression is suggestive of hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia can cause polyuria through a combination of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and volume contraction. It can also cause constipation by reducing bowel motility and cause fatigue and depression through its effects on the central nervous system. The hypertension and costovertebral angle tenderness suggest renal pathology, possibly nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis secondary to the hypercalcemia. In a patient with a significant smoking history, the most likely cause of hypercalcemia is a paraneoplastic syndrome due to malignancy, particularly small cell lung cancer, which is associated with ectopic production of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP). PTHrP, like parathyroid hormone (PTH), can increase renal calcium reabsorption and bone resorption, leading to hypercalcemia. Small cell lung cancer originates from neuroendocrine cells called Kulchitsky cells (choice E), which can secrete a variety of polypeptides, including adrenocorticotropic hormone, antidiuretic hormone, and PTHrP.

2205,"The patient's symptoms of dermatitis, glossitis, and neuropathy, along with excessive ingestion of raw egg whites, suggest a diagnosis of biotin deficiency. Avidin, a protein found in egg whites, binds biotin and prevents its absorption. Cooking denatures avidin and prevents it from binding biotin. This patient's consumption of raw egg whites has caused a deficiency in biotin, which is a coenzyme for carboxylase enzymes, including pyruvate carboxylase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, propionyl-CoA carboxylase, and Î²-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase. These enzymes are involved in gluconeogenesis, fatty acid synthesis, and amino acid metabolism.

Option 'E' Oxaloacetate is the correct answer. Pyruvate carboxylase is involved in the first step of gluconeogenesis (formation of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources), which occurs in the mitochondria. In this reaction, pyruvate is carboxylated to oxaloacetate, a reaction that requires biotin as a cofactor. Therefore, in biotin deficiency, there is a decrease in oxaloacetate levels.

As for the other options:

Option: {'A': 'Cystathionine', 'B': 'Ribulose-5-phosphate', 'C': 'Adenine', 'D': 'Lactate', 'E': 'Oxaloacetate'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is B: Ribulose-5-phosphate.
This patient's symptoms of dermatitis, glossitis, neurologic abnormalities (eg, peripheral neuropathy), and fatigue are suggestive of vitamin B7 (biotin) deficiency. Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin and an essential cofactor for several carboxylation reactions, including the conversion of propionyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA, pyruvate to oxaloacetate, and acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. By consuming raw egg whites daily for the past year, his body has absorbed a protein called avidin, which is found in raw egg whites and binds biotin, preventing its absorption in the gut. Ribulose-5-phosphate is a precursor to nucleotide synthesis and needs biotin as a coenzyme in its synthetic pathway, thus this would be the substance most likely decreased in this patient as a result of biotin deficiency.

Option 'A' Cystathionine is an intermediate in the synthesis of cysteine from homocysteine, a process that requires vitamin B6, but biotin does not play a role in this pathway. 'C' Adenine is involved in nucleotide synthesis, but its synthesis is not directly dependent on biotin. 'D' Lactate is a product of anaerobic glycolysis and is not directly influenced by biotin levels. 'E' Oxaloacetate is a component of the citric acid cycle and while its conversion from pyruvate does involve biotin, it is not a substance that would be measured in the context of a deficiency. It is produced from other sources as well."

This patient's decreased visual acuity, light sensitivity, and brown deposits on the corneal epithelium are suggestive of chloroquine/thioridazine toxicity. Thioridazine is an antipsychotic of the phenothiazine class, and its use can result in retinal pigmentary degeneration, with the deposition of fine brown pigment in the cornea and lens. The degeneration may occur with daily doses >800 mg or with cumulative doses >2000 g, leading to nyctalopia (night blindness), decreased visual acuity, and constricted visual fields.

Chlorpromazine (Option A) is an antipsychotic from the same class as thioridazine and can cause corneal deposits. However, these deposits are typically small and located in the inferior cornea, and the condition is not associated with decreased visual acuity or light sensitivity.

The retinal changes are dose-dependent and can occur with doses above 800 mg/day. Symptoms include difficulty seeing in the dark or low light and loss of visual acuity. Initial ocular findings are fine granular pigmentation in the area centralis of the retina. As the condition progresses, the pigmentation coalesces into a ""salt and pepper"" or ""leopard-skin"" pattern. In advanced cases, pigmentation is diffuse and involves the entire fundus, and visual acuity can drop to the 20/200 range.

5784,"The correct answer is D. MRI of the spine. 

This patient's back pain, especially in the context of her history of breast cancer, raises concern for bony metastasis to the spine. Vertebral metastases can cause pain by expanding the bone cortex or invading the periosteum, both of which stimulate nerve endings. When the cancer infiltrates the vertebral body, it weakens the bone and can lead to pathologic fractures, causing sudden, severe pain. Although the pain is typically worse with movement, weight bearing, or at night, it can also be present at rest. 

In this patient, the most appropriate initial diagnostic step is an MRI of the spine. An MRI provides detailed images of the bone marrow and is the most sensitive modality for early detection of spinal metastases. 

As for the other options:

A. Positron emission tomography (PET) - Although PET can be used to identify bony metastases, it is not used as the first-line modality for diagnosing spinal metastases due to its lower sensitivity compared to an MRI. 

B. Bone biopsy - This is invasive and not typically the first step in diagnosing bony metastases. It would be reserved for cases where non-invasive imaging is inconclusive.

C. X-ray of the spine - Although an X-ray can identify some bony metastases, it is less sensitive than an MRI and is not the best initial test in this case.

E. Bone scintigraphy - This technique is very sensitive but lacks specificity. It is usually performed if MRI is contraindicated.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's severe, constant, localized back pain, history of breast cancer, and elevated alkaline phosphatase level (suggestive of bone involvement) are concerning for metastatic disease. Breast cancer commonly metastasizes to bone, liver, and lung. Bone metastases may be osteolytic (from secretion of parathyroid hormone-related peptide), osteoblastic (from secretion of bone morphogenetic proteins), or mixed.

The initial imaging modality of choice to evaluate suspected bone metastasis is plain radiography ('C': 'X-ray of the spine'). If the x-ray is negative but suspicion remains high, additional imaging with MRI is recommended because of its high sensitivity. If multiple sites of disease are suspected, radionuclide bone scanning (technetium-99m scintigraphy) can be performed because of its ability to assess the whole skeleton. However, it has lower sensitivity and specificity compared with MRI. PET scan is even more sensitive but is usually reserved for cases in which other imaging modalities are inconclusive. Biopsy is typically reserved for cases in which the diagnosis is in doubt.

So, the correct answer is 'C': 'X-ray of the spine'. Other options are not wrong but based on the given scenario and guidelines, X-ray of the spine is the initial step. Other options may be considered later based on the outcomes of the X-ray."
10118,"The answer is C: Gastrointestinal endoscopy.

This patient's nonresponsive iron deficiency anemia and gastrointestinal symptoms suggest the possibility of a gastrointestinal malignancy (eg, gastric, colon cancer), which is common in adults over 40 years. Even though she is taking iron supplements, her hemoglobin, erythrocyte count, and iron studies have not improved significantly. This suggests that she has ongoing blood loss, which is outpacing iron absorption and erythropoiesis. 

A gastrointestinal endoscopy would allow for direct visualization of the upper gastrointestinal tract to identify a source of bleeding or malignancy, such as a gastric ulcer or carcinoma. If no source is identified, then a colonoscopy should be performed, given the high prevalence of colon cancer in this age group and its potential to present with iron deficiency anemia.

Option A: Hemoglobin electrophoresis is used to diagnose conditions such as thalassemia or sickle cell disease, which are unlikely given her symptoms and lab findings.

Option B: Fecal occult blood tests can be used to detect unseen blood in the stool, but they are not as definitive or informative as endoscopy. Moreover, a positive result would still require an endoscopy or colonoscopy to identify the source of bleeding.

Option D: Bone marrow biopsy would be an invasive and unnecessary step at this point. It might be considered if there were suspicion of a marrow process like myelodysplasia or aplastic anemia, which is not suggested by this patient's presentation.

This patient's lack of response to appropriate iron supplementation suggests a more sinister underlying cause, such as gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, that is not being addressed. Her history of chronic dyspepsia and minimal improvement in iron studies and hemoglobin level despite iron supplementation suggest a possible upper GI source (eg, gastric or duodenal ulcer). In a patient over 40 years of age with iron deficiency anemia, especially accompanied by GI symptoms, it is vital to rule out a GI malignancy as the cause of bleeding and anemia. Upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy is often the most appropriate next step in these patients to visualize the GI tract and to find and biopsy any potential malignancies.

Option A (Hemoglobin electrophoresis) would be useful if a hemoglobinopathy (eg, thalassemia, sickle cell disease) were suspected, but this patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are more consistent with iron deficiency anemia.

Option B (Fecal occult blood tests) can detect blood not visible in the stool, but it does not localize the source of bleeding.

Option D (Bone marrow biopsy) might be considered if there were suspicion of a primary bone marrow disorder, which is not suggested in this case.

Option E (Helicobacter pylori fecal antigen) could be considered given the patient's chronic dyspepsia, but the anemia should take precedence as it is the more severe symptom. If an upper endoscopy is performed and an ulcer is found, it would be appropriate to test for H. pylori at that time."

This is a medical emergency with substantial maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The initial management of eclampsia includes ensuring a secure airway and stabilization with magnesium sulfate, which is the medication of choice for the prevention and treatment of seizures in preeclampsia/eclampsia.

Management involves stabilizing the mother and delivering the fetus as soon as it is feasible. Initial management should focus on ensuring a secure airway and preventing maternal injury during the seizure.

8519,"The correct answer is A: 'Insufficient CFTR channel production'. 

Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The most common mutation, known as F508del, results in the deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 of the CFTR protein. This mutation causes the protein to fold incorrectly, leading to its degradation in the cell's proteasomes.

This misfolded protein is detected by the cell?s quality control system and is degraded, leading to insufficient amounts of CFTR at the cell surface.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

Option B: Defective post-translational glycosylation of the CFTR channel. Glycosylation does take place during the processing of the CFTR protein, but it is not the main defect in cystic fibrosis. The primary problem is a folding defect that leads to degradation of the protein before it reaches the cell surface.

Option C: Excess CFTR channel production. This is incorrect; the problem in cystic fibrosis is insufficient CFTR at the cell surface, not excess.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

Thyroid carcinoma (Choice A) is not typically associated with asbestos exposure or the symptoms the patient is exhibiting.

Tuberculosis (Choice B) could present with similar respiratory symptoms, but the patient's occupational history and absence of systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss) make it less likely. Also, TB would not typically cause bilateral calcified pleural plaques.

Sarcoidosis (Choice C) is a systemic granulomatous disease that typically presents with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on imaging, noncaseating granulomas on biopsy, and may have systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue. It would not typically cause the lower lobe fibrosis or calcified pleural plaques seen in this patient.

Bronchogenic carcinoma (Choice E) is indeed associated with smoking and asbestos exposure, but it would not typically cause the lower lobe fibrosis or calcified pleural plaques seen in this patient.

346,"The correct answer is D. The patient's symptoms and lab results are consistent with sickle cell disease, which is a common genetic disorder in African-Americans.

Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means that two copies of an abnormal gene must be present in order for the disease to develop. If both of her parents are carriers of the Tay-Sachs mutation (which is likely given that two of their children had the disease), this woman has a 50% chance of also being a carrier. 

This is because each parent has one normal and one abnormal Tay-Sachs gene. So in each pregnancy, there is a 50% chance they will pass on the abnormal gene to their child. 

Let's look at the wrong options:
'A': '0%' is incorrect because the chance cannot be zero given the family history of Tay-Sachs disease.
'B': '25%' is incorrect because this is the chance of a child having Tay-Sachs disease if both parents are carriers, not the chance of being a carrier.
'C': '33%' and 'D': '66%' are incorrect because the chance of being a carrier does not fit into these percentages when both parents are known carriers. The possibilities for each child of two carrier parents are 25% chance of being affected, 50% chance of being a carrier, and 25% chance of not carrying the gene at all.","stop","the correct answer is 'e': '50%'.","E","D","USMLE question: A 25-year-old woman presents to you for a routine health checkup.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means it is carried on a non-sex chromosome and both parents must contribute a copy of the defective gene for a child to be affected. If both parents are carriers (heterozygous) for the disease, each child has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being a carrier like the parents, and a 25% chance of not carrying the mutation at all.

In this case, the patient's two siblings died from Tay-Sachs disease, implying that both of her parents were carriers. Since the patient is unaffected, she could either be a carrier (inherited one defective gene) or not carry the mutation at all (inherited no defective genes). Therefore, the possible genotypes for this woman are either heterozygous carrier or homozygous non-carrier.

Since there are two possibilities, and one of them is being a carrier, the probability is 50% that she is a heterozygous carrier of the mutation that causes Tay-Sachs disease. So, the correct option is 'E: 50%'.

The other options are incorrect because they either underestimate or overestimate her risk. For example, 'A: 0%' would be the risk if both parents were unaffected and non-carriers, and 'D: 66%' would be the risk if one parent was affected and the other was a carrier.

Option 'A' is describing a condition known as Nutcracker Syndrome, which typically presents with left-sided flank pain and hematuria, not a scrotal mass. 

Option 'C', Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection leading to epididymitis, typically presents with acute onset of severe testicular pain, often associated with urinary symptoms and possibly urethral discharge. The testis would likely be tender on examination, not simply described as a palpable mass.

Option 'D', unilateral failure of the left testis to descend into the scrotum, is known as cryptorchidism. This typically presents as an absence of one or both testes from the scrotum, not as a mass.

Option 'E', twisting of the spermatic cord secondary to rotation of the left testis, describes testicular torsion. This condition typically presents with sudden onset severe testicular pain, often with associated nausea and vomiting. Again, this would not typically present as a palpable mass.

A hydrocele is a fluid-filled sac surrounding a testicle that results in the swelling of the scrotum. The processus vaginalis is an outpouching of the peritoneum that normally closes after the testis descends into the scrotum. If it remains patent, it can allow peritoneal fluid to enter the scrotum, leading to a hydrocele.

Option A: Compression of the left renal vein at the aortic origin of the superior mesenteric artery is a description of nutcracker syndrome, which usually presents with left flank pain and hematuria due to increased venous pressure and ruptured small vessels.

Option C: Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection leads to epididymitis, which is characterized by acute onset of severe pain, redness, and swelling, and is usually unilateral. It often presents with symptoms of a urinary tract infection and is less likely to cause a palpable, painless mass.

CDIs are often caused by clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins, including ceftriaxone. This occurs because these antibiotics disrupt the normal gut flora, allowing C. difficile to proliferate. The bacteria then release toxins that cause inflammation and damage to the colon resulting in symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever.

The most sensitive test for diagnosing a CDI is the nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) (Option D), which is a PCR test for the toxin B gene. This test has mostly replaced other diagnostic methods due to its high sensitivity (>90%).

Option A (Endoscopy) is not typically used for diagnosis of CDI as it is invasive and potentially risky for elderly patients or those with comorbidities. 

Option B (Enzyme immunoassay glutamate dehydrogenase) is a test for a common antigen produced by both toxigenic and nontoxigenic C. difficile. However, it has a high false-positive rate and is less sensitive than the NAAT.

Option C (Gram stain of stool sample) can be used to identify C. difficile, but the sensitivity is relatively low because the organism may be present in small numbers and can be missed.

This patient's presentation of fever, myalgias, and leukopenia, as well as the finding of dark purple, mulberry-like inclusions inside granulocytes on a peripheral blood smear is suggestive of anaplasmosis. Anaplasmosis is a tick-borne disease common in the northeastern and upper midwestern United States. The Anaplasma organism infects white blood cells, where it forms clusters known as morulae (mulberry-like inclusions).

The drug of choice for anaplasmosis is doxycycline, a protein synthesis inhibitor that is bacteriostatic. It works by binding the 30S ribosomal subunit and preventing the attachment of aminoacyl-tRNA to the RNA-ribosome complex. It also inhibits the bacterial peptidyl transferase activity at the 50S ribosomal subunit, which prevents the addition of new amino acids to the growing peptide chain.

A. 'Transcription of bacterial DNA by RNA-polymerase' - This is the mechanism of action of the drug rifampin, not doxycycline.

C. 'Bacterial topoisomerase II and topoisomerase IV activity' - This is the mechanism of action of fluoroquinolones, not doxycycline.

D. 'Peptidoglycan crosslinking and bacterial cell wall synthesis' - This is the mechanism of action of beta-lactam antibiotics, not doxycycline.

E. 'Binding of bacterial tRNA to the acceptor site of ribosomes' - This is the mechanism of action of the drug tetracycline, not doxycycline.

Clinical features include fever, headache, myalgia, and malaise. Laboratory findings may demonstrate leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver transaminases. The pathognomonic finding is morulae (clusters of organisms) in monocytes on peripheral blood smear.

Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic medication used in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute asthma exacerbations. It works by blocking muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the smooth muscles of the bronchi in the lungs, preventing bronchoconstriction and increasing airway caliber. It leads to the inhibition of the parasympathetic system, which results in an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This increase in cAMP leads to bronchodilation.

Option B, the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) system, is not directly affected by ipratropium bromide. It is more related to medications such as nitrates and sildenafil, which enhance the effect of nitric oxide leading to an increase in cGMP and vasodilation.

Option C, the arachidonic acid system, is more related to the production of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes. It is not directly affected by ipratropium bromide.

Option D, the phosphoinositol system, is not directly affected by ipratropium bromide. It is involved in the action of hormones and growth factors, leading to the production of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which trigger the release of calcium and protein kinase C activation, respectively.

Option E, the tyrosine kinase system, is associated with the action of growth factors and cytokines. It is not directly affected by ipratropium bromide."

The PCV13 vaccine is typically given to children under the age of 2 years and adults with certain health conditions, but it is not generally recommended for adults over the age of 65. This is because the vaccine's effectiveness decreases with age. Instead, the PPSV23 vaccine is recommended for adults over the age of 65 because it protects against more strains of pneumococcus bacteria and is more effective in older adults.

Option 'B': A history of intussusception is not a contraindication for PCV13. Intussusception is a concern with rotavirus vaccine in infants, but not with PCV13.

1910,"The most likely cause of this patient's illness is a Norovirus infection. Norovirus is a nonenveloped, (+) ssRNA virus (Choice D) that is a common cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. It spreads primarily through the fecal-oral route, either by direct person-to-person transmission or through contaminated food or water. Outbreaks frequently occur in closed and crowded environments such as daycare centers, nursing homes, schools, and cruise ships. Infections can occur throughout the year but are most common during the winter months. Symptoms typically include nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea, and abdominal pain that usually resolve within 1-3 days. Fever is present in about half of cases. Diagnosis is usually clinical, but PCR testing of stool can be done in outbreaks or severe cases.

633,"The most likely reason for treatment failure in this patient is 'E: Poor delivery of the medicines to the target tissue'. 

This patient's initial presentation of fever and new lung consolidation on chest X-ray is suggestive of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), which is defined as pneumonia that occurs 48 hours or more after admission, which was not incubating at the time of admission. The most common causes of HAP are gram-negative bacilli (eg, Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive cocci (eg, Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S aureus). Empiric antibiotics are chosen based on local resistance patterns. Treatment failure with appropriate therapy (eg, persistent fever, worsening radiographic findings) after 72 hours often suggests a noninfectious cause or a complication such as an abscess or necrotizing pneumonia. However, in critically ill, intubated patients, poor delivery of antibiotic to the infected lung tissue due to alterations in the distribution and clearance of the drug can also be a cause of treatment failure. Altered pharmacokinetics in critically ill patients can be due to changes in volume of distribution and drug clearance associated with conditions such as shock, use of vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement therapy.

This patient has developed hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), which is often due to gram-negative bacilli (eg, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) or Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA). Risk factors for HAP include mechanical ventilation, which bypasses the upper airway's defense mechanisms, allowing bacteria direct access to the sterile lower respiratory tract. Antibiotic treatment is often ineffective, despite in vitro susceptibility of the pathogen, due to inadequate antibiotic penetration into the lung parenchyma and respiratory secretions, making poor delivery of the medicines to the target tissue (Choice E) the most likely cause of treatment failure.

The other choices do not typically account for antibiotic treatment failure in cases of pneumonia. For instance, abnormally rapid clearance of the medicines by the kidney (Choice A) is unlikely without evidence of renal dysfunction. Similarly, abnormally rapid metabolism of the medicines by the liver (Choice B) is a less likely cause of treatment failure as neither cefepime nor daptomycin is metabolized by the liver.

This newborn's hypoglycemia (glucose <40 mg/dL), jitteriness, poor feeding, and high hematocrit are most likely due to maternal smoking, which leads to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and chronic fetal hypoxia. Chronic fetal hypoxia results in increased erythropoiesis and subsequent polycythemia (Hct >65%), which can be seen with facial plethora and symptomatic hyperviscosity (eg, poor feeding, lethargy, irritability). Fetal hypoxia also induces hyperplasia of the pancreatic islets and increased insulin production, leading to neonatal hypoglycemia.

In CVI, dysfunction of the venous valves in the deep, superficial, or perforating veins leads to venous hypertension. This can cause edema, skin changes and, eventually, ulceration. Reflux (ie, reversal of blood flow direction) due to valve dysfunction is a common finding in CVI. 

The great saphenous vein is the longest vein in the body and is commonly affected in CVI. Normally, blood flows from the superficial venous system (eg, great saphenous vein) into the deep system (eg, femoral vein) to return to the heart. Therefore, reversal of this flow (ie, 'Great saphenous vein to femoral vein' (Choice D)) would indicate venous insufficiency.

Flow from the 'Anterior tibial vein to popliteal vein' (Choice A), 'Femoral vein to external iliac vein' (Choice C), and 'Dorsal venous arch to great saphenous vein' (Choice E) are all normal flow directions. 

Flow from the 'Popliteal vein to small saphenous vein' (Choice B) would indicate reflux, but this is less likely the cause of her symptoms because the small saphenous vein is in the posterior leg and would not typically cause medial ankle skin changes."
8931,"The patient's symptoms of difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) with choking, regurgitation of undigested food, and halitosis are suggestive of a Zenker's diverticulum.

Over time, the diverticulum can expand and cause progressively worsening symptoms. The halitosis is due to stagnation of food in the diverticulum, leading to bacterial overgrowth and subsequent bad breath.

Option A is incorrect because the circular and longitudinal muscle layers of the esophagus are not the location of a Zenker's diverticulum. Both these layers are part of the esophageal wall, not the transition zone where the diverticulum forms.

2191,"The correct answer is B. Intravenous regular insulin.

Gestational diabetes (GDM) is associated with macrosomia, which is defined as an estimated fetal weight >4000 g (8 lb 13 oz). This is due to the effect of maternal hyperglycemia leading to fetal hyperinsulinemia, which stimulates excessive growth. In this patient, the estimated fetal weight is just under the threshold for macrosomia, which, along with the history of GDM treated with insulin, indicates that this patient has significant hyperglycemia that requires continued management during labor. The goal during labor is to maintain maternal glucose levels in the range of 70-110 mg/dL to minimize neonatal hypoglycemia. Intravenous regular insulin along with dextrose is the preferred method to accomplish this goal.

A) 5% dextrose - This would be incorrect as it could increase her blood glucose levels without the presence of insulin.

Gestational diabetes (GD) is associated with fetal macrosomia, increased risk of birth trauma, and neonatal hypoglycemia. It is important to manage GD with blood glucose control which reduces the risk of these complications. During labor, women with GD should be managed with a combined infusion of dextrose and insulin to maintain a blood glucose level between 70-110 mg/dL. 

Option A, 5% dextrose, is a part of management but it should be combined with insulin. Administering dextrose alone may contribute to hyperglycemia without the insulin to allow it to be utilized.

Option C, 25% magnesium sulphate, is used for seizure prophylaxis in pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, not indicated in this patient.

Option D, Erythrocyte mass, would be used in cases of severe anemia, but this patient's Hb is within the normal range for a pregnant woman.

Option E, subcutaneous insulin, is used for long-term control of diabetes but during labor, intravenous regular insulin is preferred for its rapid onset and short duration of action, allowing for quick adjustments based on blood glucose monitoring. 

This patient's fasting glucose and HbA1c levels are elevated, indicating poor glycemic control, and the baby's estimated weight is at the high end of normal, suggesting potential macrosomia, both of which are common in poorly controlled GD.

9520,"The answer is E: Absorption of 7-dehydroxylated bile will decrease.

The last section of the ileum (terminal ileum) is the primary site for absorption of bile salts. Bile salts are produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder, then released into the duodenum during digestion. After being secreted into the intestine, bile acids aid in the digestion and absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Approximately 95% of bile salts are reabsorbed in the terminal ileum and recycled back to the liver via the enterohepatic circulation. 

Following resection of the terminal ileum (as in this patient), the absorption of bile salts is impaired, leading to an increase in the amount of bile acids excreted in the stool (option E). This can result in diarrhea and malabsorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins.

Option A is incorrect because the absorption of vitamin K (as well as other fat-soluble vitamins) can be impaired due to the loss of bile salts.

Option B is wrong because the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver is not directly affected by resection of the terminal ileum.

Option C is incorrect because the balance of the components in bile (bile acids, cholesterol, phospholipids) is regulated by the liver, not by absorption in the terminal ileum.

Option D is incorrect because changes in bile salts can alter the intestinal environment and potentially affect the composition of the gut microbiota.","stop","the answer is e: absorption of 7-dehydroxylated bile will decrease.","E","C","USMLE question: A 32-year-old woman comes to her doctorâ??s office with abdominal distention, diffuse abdominal pain, and a history of 10â??12 bowel movements a day for the last week.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is E. Absorption of 7?-dehydroxylated bile will decrease. 

The terminal ileum is the primary site of bile salt absorption. When a significant length of ileum is resected, as in this patient, the body's ability to absorb bile salts is compromised. 7?-dehydroxylated bile acids, the major components of bile salts, are absorbed in the terminal ileum. Because they are not being absorbed as efficiently, fecal loss of bile salts will increase.

Now, let's consider why the other options are incorrect.

A: Vitamin K is absorbed in the terminal ileum, similar to bile salts, so its absorption could be impaired after an ileal resection. 

B: The synthesis of cholesterol in the liver is not related to the absorption of bile salts in the ileum. Therefore, liver cholesterol synthesis is not expected to decrease after an ileal resection.

C: The balance of the components in bile is maintained by the liver and gallbladder, not the ileum. Thus, ileal resection does not directly alter the composition of bile.

D: The bacterial population in the small intestine could potentially be affected by an ileal resection. If bile salts are not being absorbed as efficiently, more will remain in the intestine, which could affect the types and quantities of bacteria present."
5076,"The patient's irregularly irregular pulse and absence of P waves on ECG are consistent with atrial fibrillation. In atrial fibrillation, the atria quiver instead of beating effectively, which can lead to blood stasis and subsequent thrombus formation, particularly in the left atrial appendage. A thrombus in the left atrial appendage is a common source of emboli in patients with atrial fibrillation, which can lead to ischemic stroke. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is particularly useful for visualizing the left atrium and left atrial appendage, as these structures are immediately anterior to the esophagus. Therefore, the answer is B, Myxoma in the left atrium. However, a myxoma is a benign tumor and not a thrombus, but it is the closest option to a thrombus in the left atrium or left atrial appendage, which is what this patient is at risk for.

This is concerning because if a thrombus dislodges and embolizes, it may lead to a stroke.

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a highly sensitive and specific method for detecting thrombus in the left atrium and appendage. During a TEE, the patient swallows an ultrasound probe, which is then positioned in the esophagus directly posterior to the heart.

The patient's vaccine-related and immunity-related factors have been taken into account, including his HIV status, his travel plans, his immunization history, and his current health status. His anti-HBs (hepatitis B surface antibody) level indicates that he has immunity to hepatitis B, making option A unnecessary. The Bacillus Calmette Guerin vaccine (option B) is not generally recommended for adults in the United States, and it's contraindicated in people with HIV due to the risk of disseminated disease. 

Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine (option C) is also a live vaccine and is generally contraindicated in patients with HIV, especially those with a CD4 count <200 cells/mm3. 

Yellow fever is a live virus vaccine (option D) and should be avoided in individuals with HIV, particularly if CD4 count is <200 cells/mm3. Thailand is not in the yellow fever zone, so it is unnecessary for this patient's planned trip. 

Given this patient's immunization history and planned travel, no additional vaccines are needed at this time. 

It's important to remember that HIV-infected patients should receive all age-appropriate vaccinations.

8536,"The correct answer is B. Congenital cytomegalovirus infection.

This infant's findings of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), microcephaly, jaundice, purpura (ie, petechiae, blueberry muffin rash), ocular abnormalities (eg, chorioretinitis, optic atrophy), and intracranial calcifications with ventriculomegaly are consistent with congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. CMV is the most common congenital viral infection and is often asymptomatic at birth. However, some newborns (10%-15%) present with symptoms or have complications that develop later in infancy (eg, sensorineural hearing loss, cognitive impairment).

CMV is a DNA virus that is transmitted through body fluids (eg, urine, saliva, breast milk, genital secretions, blood). It is often transmitted to the fetus when a seronegative mother has a primary infection during pregnancy. However, a seropositive mother with reactivation of infection or reinfection with a different strain of CMV can also transmit the virus to the fetus.

As for the other choices:

A - Congenital Treponema pallidum (syphilis) can cause a similar presentation, but CNS findings (eg, hydrocephalus) and ocular abnormalities (eg, interstitial keratitis) typically do not develop until later in infancy or childhood.

C - Congenital rubella infection can cause cataracts, cardiac defects (eg, patent ductus arteriosus), and sensorineural hearing loss (the classic triad), but it typically does not cause IUGR or intracranial calcifications.

D - Congenital parvovirus B19 infection can cause hydrops fetalis and severe fetal anemia, but it does not cause the intracranial or ocular findings seen in this patient.

In emergency situations when a child's life is at risk, physicians have a duty to provide necessary life-saving treatment, regardless of parental religious beliefs. The best approach in a situation like this, where the parents are refusing potentially life-saving treatment, is to seek a court order to overrule the parents' refusal. 

Option A, consulting the hospital ethics committee, may be a useful course of action in less urgent cases, but in an emergency situation, it would take too much time.

Option B, proceeding to surgery without a transfusion, could put the child's life at risk. In severe cases of blood loss and shock, a blood transfusion can be a necessary life-saving intervention.

Option D, transfusing packed red blood cells to the son but not to father, contradicts the father's explicit wishes. Moreover, the father, as an adult, has the right to refuse treatment for himself.

His son sustained multiple body contusions and loss of consciousness. He remains unresponsive in the emergency department. A focused assessment of the boy with sonography is concerning for multiple organ lacerations and internal bleeding. The physician decides to move the man's son to the operating room for emergency surgical exploration. The father says that he and his son are Jehovah's witnesses and do not want blood transfusions. The physician calls the boy's biological mother who confirms this religious belief. She also asks the physician to wait for her arrival before any other medical decisions are undertaken.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is C. 'Seek a court order for medical treatment of the son'. 

In general, parents are permitted to make medical decisions on behalf of their minor children. However, when a parent's decision places a child's life in immediate danger due to refusal of a life-saving treatment (such as refusal of a blood transfusion in an exsanguinating patient), physicians are legally and ethically justified in seeking court intervention to override parental refusal. In this case, the court usually sides with the physician in interest of preserving the life of the child.

Option A: Consult hospital ethics committee for medical treatment of the son - While consulting an ethics committee may be appropriate in some situations, it is likely too time-consuming in this emergency situation.

Option B: Proceed to surgery on the son without transfusion - This could place the child's life at immediate risk. 

Option D: Transfuse packed red blood cells to the son but not to father - The father, as an adult, has the capacity to refuse medical treatment for himself. However, the child's life is in immediate danger and a transfusion should not be withheld simply due to parental religious belief.

Option E: Wait for the son's mother before providing further treatment - Waiting could put the child's life at unnecessary risk. In this type of emergency situation, delaying treatment could lead to significant harm or death of the child."

1693,"The answer is C: 'Head elevation, sedation, mannitol, hyperventilation'. 

This patient's bradycardia, hypertension, and irregular respirations (Cushing triad) are concerning for increased intracranial pressure (ICP) secondary to a traumatic brain injury. The most likely diagnosis is epidural hematoma, which is typically caused by injury to the middle meningeal artery due to a temporal bone fracture. These patients may initially have a lucid interval followed by rapid neurologic deterioration due to the accumulation of arterial blood in the epidural space, leading to increased ICP.

First-line management of increased ICP is head elevation to 30 degrees to promote venous outflow. Sedation is important to reduce metabolic demand, agitation, and resultant hypertension, which can further increase ICP. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, can draw fluid out of the swollen brain tissue, reducing ICP. Finally, hyperventilation can cause vasoconstriction and reduction of cerebral blood flow, thereby decreasing ICP.

Option A is incorrect because norepinephrine can increase blood pressure and thus increase ICP. Option B is incorrect because hypoventilation can lead to hypercapnia, which would increase cerebral blood flow and ICP.

Hypertonic saline or mannitol can be used to reduce brain edema. Ventilation should be adjusted to maintain a normal partial pressure of carbon dioxide, as hypocapnia (commonly caused by hyperventilation) can reduce ICP but may lead to cerebral ischemia.

These defects lead to loss of membrane surface area, resulting in spherically shaped erythrocytes (spherocytes) which have decreased deformability, and are prematurely sequestered and destroyed by the spleen, leading to hemolytic anemia. Additional findings in HS can include splenomegaly and cholelithiasis, secondary to chronic hemolysis.

LSS occurs as a result of age-related degenerative changes (eg, osteophytes, facet hypertrophy, ligamentum flavum thickening, disc protrusion) that narrow the spinal canal and compress the cauda equina nerve roots. Patients often report improvement with leaning forward (eg, pushing a shopping cart) because this action increases the size of the spinal canal and relieves nerve root impingement. LSS can be differentiated from vascular claudication (ie, peripheral artery disease), in which pain is induced by walking and relieved by rest, but not by posture. The physical examination is often normal in LSS, but can show neurologic findings (eg, weakness, diminished reflexes) in severe cases. The first-line diagnostic test for suspected LSS is an MRI of the spine (Choice E) to visualize the nerve roots and determine the degree of stenosis.

Ankle-brachial index (Choice A) and cilostazol (Choice B) would be appropriate for peripheral artery disease, which is less likely due to the posture-dependent nature of the pain and the presence of normal peripheral pulses.
CT angiography of the lower extremities (Choice C) could also diagnose peripheral artery disease, but this is not suspected in this patient.
Epidural corticosteroid injection (Choice D) is a treatment option for LSS, but a definitive diagnosis should first be made with imaging.","stop","the first-line diagnostic test for suspected lss is an mri of the spine (choice e) to visualize the nerve roots and determine the degree of stenosis.","E","E","USMLE question: A 67-year-old man presents with pain in both legs.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and smoking, in combination with his symptoms of pain in the legs that worsens with walking and is relieved with rest, is suggestive of peripheral artery disease (PAD). PAD is caused by atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities and presents as intermittent claudication. Intermittent claudication is characterized by pain in the lower extremities that is reproduced with exertion and relieved with rest. The diagnosis of PAD is established by an ankle-brachial index (ABI) <0.90 at rest or decrease in the ABI by >20% following exercise (Choice A). 

Choice B: Cilostazol is a medication used to treat intermittent claudication in patients with PAD. However, you need to confirm the diagnosis first before starting the treatment.

Schizophrenia is diagnosed when there are >2 characteristic symptoms (eg, delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized/catatonic behavior, negative symptoms) for >6 months with significant functional decline. This patient's chronic (>6 months) psychosis and history of severe depression suggest a diagnosis of schizophrenia.

Major depressive disorder (option E) also may have psychotic features, but only during depressive episodes. This patient's psychosis is present outside the context of a mood disorder, ruling out these diagnoses.
Brief psychotic disorder (option B) presents with similar symptoms to schizophrenia but lasts <1 month.

This patient's symptoms of delusions (government spying on him), disorganized behavior (running around the park naked), disorganized speech (talks non-stop, third person reference), and negative symptoms (gaunt appearance likely due to self-neglect) that have been present for several years are indicative of schizophrenia. According to the DSM-5, the diagnosis of schizophrenia requires the presence of at least two of the following symptoms for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated): delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, and negative symptoms. At least one of the symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months, which fits with this patient's medical history.

9919,"The correct answer is A: Necrosis. 

This patientâ??s presentation is suggestive of fulminant hepatic failure, which is characterized by severe liver damage and the rapid onset of hepatic encephalopathy. Fulminant hepatic failure can result from many causes, including viral hepatitis, drug toxicity, and hepatic ischemia. In this patient, the recent travel to South America and initial febrile illness suggest a viral etiology like Yellow Fever or another hemorrhagic fever. The presence of eosinophilic (pink) degeneration and nuclear condensation in the hepatocytes on liver biopsy is indicative of coagulative necrosis, a form of necrosis characterized by the preservation of cellular architecture. Coagulative necrosis often results from sudden interruption of blood supply, as occurs in hepatic ischemia or severe viral hepatitis.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:
B: Regeneration - While the liver has a significant ability to regenerate, it cannot compensate for the rapid and severe damage seen in fulminant hepatic failure.
C: Apoptosis - This is a form of cell death that is usually a regulated process and does not result in inflammation. It would not account for this patient's severe liver damage.
D: Proliferation - This refers to an increase in cell number, which is not what is happening in this case of severe hepatocyte damage.

Physical examination shows jaundice, epigastric tenderness, and petechiae over his trunk. Five hours after admission, he develops dark brown emesis and anuria. Despite appropriate lifesaving measures, he dies. Postmortem liver biopsy shows eosinophilic degeneration of hepatocytes with condensed nuclear chromatin.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is A: Necrosis.

The patient's presentation is indicative of yellow fever, a mosquito-borne flavivirus endemic to tropical areas of Africa and South America. The initial 3-6 days after infection (infective period) are typically asymptomatic, followed by an abrupt onset of fever, chills, headache, and myalgias. After a brief remission, a second, more toxic phase may occur in some patients, manifesting as high fever, jaundice (due to hepatocellular damage), and hemorrhagic phenomena (eg, epigastric pain, vomiting, petechiae). Multiorgan dysfunction, including renal failure (as evidenced by anuria in this patient), can also occur.

The liver biopsy findings of eosinophilic (pink) degeneration and condensed nuclear chromatin within hepatocytes are features of necrosis, a form of cell death resulting from severe cell injury. Necrosis is characterized by cell and organelle swelling, breakdown of plasma and organelle membranes, and spillage of intracellular contents, which can cause inflammation. In contrast, apoptosis (option C) is a process of programmed cell death that does not release cellular contents and therefore generally does not cause inflammation.

Steatosis (option E) refers to the abnormal retention of lipids within a cell and is not indicated in this scenario. Regeneration (option B) and proliferation (option D) refer to processes of cell growth and division that occur in response to injury or loss of cells. These processes would not result in the pathologic findings seen in this patient's hepatocytes."
9286,"The answer is 'D': Neurosyphilis.

This patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of general paresis of the insane, a form of neurosyphilis. Neurosyphilis can occur in patients who have a history of inadequately treated syphilis. Symptoms are variable and non-specific, often leading to delayed diagnosis. Common symptoms include headache, personality changes, and symptoms of meningitis, such as neck stiffness and altered mental status. The CSF results are characteristic of a chronic meningitis with a high cell count (mostly lymphocytes), mildly elevated protein, and normal glucose.

Option 'A': Brain abscess would typically present with focal neurologic signs related to the location of the abscess, which are not present in this patient. Also, the CSF in brain abscess usually shows low glucose, which is not the case here.

Option 'B': Infection with herpes simplex virus can cause viral encephalitis, but the onset of symptoms is usually more acute and the CSF findings are usually more dramatic with a higher cell count, higher protein, and lower glucose levels.

Option 'C': Infection with Streptococcal pneumoniae can cause bacterial meningitis. However, the CSF in bacterial meningitis typically shows a higher cell count, much higher protein, and significantly lower glucose levels than what is seen here.

The CSF findings of lymphocytic pleocytosis and increased protein are characteristic of neurosyphilis, further supporting the diagnosis.

Option 'A': Brain abscess would most likely show focal neurologic signs related to the area of the brain affected, and this patient's symptoms are more generalized. Additionally, the CSF study would likely show neutrophilic pleocytosis, not lymphocytic.

Option 'B': Infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) often presents with fever, headache, and altered mental status, but temporal lobe involvement typically results in characteristic findings on neuroimaging, such as temporal lobe edema or hemorrhage, which was not seen in this patient.

Option 'C': Infection with Streptococcal pneumoniae often results in bacterial meningitis. The CSF findings in bacterial meningitis usually show a high neutrophil count, low glucose levels, and high protein levels.

5385,"This patient's long-standing history of gradual enlargement of her fingertips (clubbing), recent onset of hoarseness, and a faint wheezing (stridor) in the right upper lung field suggests a lung neoplasm. Clubbing is characterized by increased convexity of the nail fold and is seen in numerous underlying diseases, most commonly lung cancer, interstitial lung disease, and cyanotic heart disease. The most common cause of acquired clubbing in adults is lung cancer, especially non-small cell types. Hoarseness can be caused by recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis from tumor compression, and stridor suggests an obstruction of a large airway. This patient likely has a Pancoast (superior sulcus) tumor, which is typically a non-small cell lung cancer located at the lung apex and can invade the brachial plexus, ribs, and vertebral bodies.

1459,"The correct answer is D. Malignant mesothelioma. 

This patient's occupational history of working in a naval shipyard, combined with the presence of pleural plaques on imaging, suggests long-standing asbestos exposure. Asbestos fibers, once inhaled, can travel to the terminal airways and alveoli and migrate to the pleura, where they cause fibrosis and inflammation. This can result in the formation of pleural plaques, the most common manifestation of asbestos exposure. Although pleural plaques are benign and do not typically lead to lung dysfunction, they are often a marker of significant asbestos exposure. 

The two most important pulmonary complications of asbestos exposure are lung cancer (often bronchogenic carcinoma) and malignant mesothelioma. Although asbestos-exposed smokers have a greatly increased risk of lung cancer, this patient's physical examination and imaging findings of bibasilar crackles and subpleural fibrosis are not typical for bronchogenic carcinoma (Choice A). Instead, these findings suggest the presence of asbestosis, which is associated with a particularly high risk of malignant mesothelioma. 

Aspergilloma (Choice B) typically presents with hemoptysis and is associated with preexisting lung cavities, which are not mentioned here.

This patient's history of working in a shipyard for several decades combined with his symptoms and radiographic findings of diffuse bilateral infiltrates, pleural reticulonodular opacities, pleural plaques, and subpleural linear opacities suggest asbestos exposure. Asbestos exposure is most commonly associated with shipbuilding, roofing, and plumbing. The most common pulmonary findings in patients with asbestos exposure are pleural plaques, which are areas of fibrous thickening of the pleura that can be seen on x-ray or CT. However, these plaques do not correlate with the extent of exposure and do not result in impaired lung function.

The most serious complication of asbestos exposure is malignant mesothelioma, a rare and aggressive cancer that primarily affects the pleura. This risk is synergistically increased with concomitant tobacco smoke exposure. Other pulmonary conditions associated with asbestos exposure include asbestosis (fibrosis of the lungs due to asbestos) and bronchogenic carcinoma.

Bronchogenic carcinoma (option A) is less likely in this patient despite his heavy smoking history because the radiographic findings are more consistent with asbestos exposure. Aspergilloma (option B) and mycobacterial infection (option C) are less likely because these typically present with more acute symptoms and signs of infection, which this patient does not have.

Cocaine is a powerful central nervous system stimulant that increases levels of dopamine in the brain circuits regulating pleasure and movement. Symptoms can include euphoria, increased energy, grandiosity, psychomotor agitation or restlessness, and in some cases, hallucinations.

Option B: An illusion is a misinterpretation of a real external stimulus. For example, mistaking a coat hanging in a dark room for a person. This patient is seeing something (animal-shaped clouds) that does not exist, which is not consistent with an illusion.

Option C: While this patient is experiencing visual hallucinations, the presence of other symptoms such as increased heart rate and rapid speech, and the positive urine screen for cocaine indicate that these are likely due to drug use, i.e., cocaine intoxication.

Option: {'A': 'Administration of levetiracetam', 'B': 'Surgical evacuation of the clots', 'C': 'Lumbar puncture', 'D': 'Decompressive craniectomy', 'E': 'Administration of methylprednisolone'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The clinical picture and imaging is suggestive of an epidural hematoma (EDH), which is a neurosurgical emergency. Epidural hematomas typically occur after a fracture of the skull during a traumatic event. The fracture damages the middle meningeal artery leading to rapid accumulation of arterial blood between the dura and the skull. The hematoma can compress the brain and shift the midline structures, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure and herniation. The classic clinical presentation of an EDH is a brief loss of consciousness (concussion), followed by a lucid interval, and then progressive loss of consciousness and neurologic symptoms. These symptoms occur due to continued bleeding and increasing intracranial pressure. The CT scan findings typically show a convex or lentiform hematoma that does not cross the suture lines. The treatment of choice is immediate surgical evacuation of the hematoma to decrease the intracranial pressure and prevent herniation. Therefore, the answer is 'B' Surgical evacuation of the clots.

Now, option 'A' Administration of levetiracetam is incorrect because it is used to prevent seizures but there is no evidence of seizures in this patient. Option 'C' Lumbar puncture is contraindicated in patients with increased intracranial pressure as it can lead to brain herniation. Option 'D' Decompressive craniectomy is used in cases of extremely high intracranial pressure that did not respond to other measures, or in cases of massive brain infarction, but this is not the case here. Option 'E' Administration of methylprednisolone is used in acute spinal cord injury, which is not indicated in this patient."
1495,"The woman's symptoms of flushing, nausea, and palpitations after consuming alcohol suggest a disulfiram-like reaction, which can occur with sulfonylureas such as chlorpropamide and glipizide used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The only other class of oral hypoglycemic agents that act on the same target (pancreatic beta cells) but at a different binding site are meglitinides (eg, repaglinide, nateglinide). Both sulfonylureas and meglitinides stimulate insulin release from pancreatic beta cells by closing ATP-dependent potassium channels. However, unlike sulfonylureas, meglitinides do not cause disulfiram-like reactions. Instead, the most common side effect of meglitinides is weight gain (option E).

Hepatotoxicity (option A) can be caused by thiazolidinediones; lactic acidosis (option B) can be a rare but serious side effect of biguanides, such as metformin; pancreatitis (option C) can be caused by glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists; and urinary tract infections (option D) are more commonly associated with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors.","stop","instead, the most common side effect of meglitinides is weight gain (option e).","E","E","USMLE question: A 52-year-old woman makes a follow-up appointment with her primary care physician for evaluation of her diabetes medications. Specifically, she complains that she has been experiencing flushing, nausea, and palpitations after drinking a glass of wine with dinner after she started the latest regimen for her diabetes. She was warned that this was a side-effect of one of her medications but she did not understand the severity of the reaction. Given this experience, she asks to be placed on an alternative regimen that does not involve the medication that caused this reaction. Her physician therefore replaces the medication with another one that interacts with the same target though at a different binding site. Which of the following is a side-effect of the new medication?
Option: {'A': 'Hepatotoxicity', 'B': 'Lactic acidosis', 'C': 'Pancreatitis', 'D': 'Urinary tract infection', 'E': 'Weight gain'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The patient is likely taking metformin, which is a biguanide used to treat type 2 diabetes. A common side effect of metformin is lactic acidosis. Therefore, the answer is 'B': Lactic acidosis.

Explanation:

The symptoms of flushing, nausea, and palpitations that the patient experiences after consuming alcohol is indicative of a disulfiram-like reaction, which is a common side effect of sulfonylureas, a class of drugs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The drug from this class which is most commonly associated with this side effect is chlorpropamide. 

If the physician switched the patient to a different drug that targets the same pathway (i.e., reducing blood glucose levels), but at a different binding site, a reasonable choice would be metformin, which is a biguanide.

Metformin primarily works by decreasing hepatic glucose production and increasing insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. It does not cause hypoglycemia or disulfiram-like reactions. However, a well-known, though rare, side effect of metformin is lactic acidosis, especially in patients with impaired renal function.

Options 'A': Hepatotoxicity,'C': Pancreatitis,'D': Urinary tract infection, and 'E': Weight gain are possible side effects of other antidiabetic medications but not typically associated with metformin."
2223,"The correct answer is A: Amyloid production. 

The man in the case presents with progressive dyspnea, reduced exercise tolerance, and orthopnea, suggesting heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. His history of drug use, especially cocaine, can lead to a dilated cardiomyopathy, which is characterized by ventricular dilatation and impaired systolic function. A dilated cardiomyopathy can also result from amyloidosis, which is a group of diseases characterized by extracellular deposition of insoluble, fibrillar proteins (amyloids) that alter the normal function of tissues. 

Now to explain why the other options are wrong:

Option B: Myosin mutation- This is usually associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, not dilated cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is characterized by thickening of the ventricular wall, most commonly the interventricular septum. 

Option C: Radiation therapy- This can lead to various cardiac pathologies including pericarditis, myocarditis, and coronary artery disease but it's not usually associated with dilated cardiomyopathy.

Option D: Turner syndrome- This condition is associated with aortic coarctation and bicuspid aortic valve, not dilated cardiomyopathy.

He started becoming very concerned when he was unable to climb the stairs to his apartment about 3 weeks ago. Since then, he has been experiencing shortness of breath even during activities of daily living. His past medical history is significant for heroin and cocaine use as well as periods of homelessness. Physical exam reveals a gallop that occurs just after the end of systole. Which of the following could lead to the same pathology that is seen in this patient?
Option: {'A': 'Amyloid production', 'B': 'Myosin mutation', 'C': 'Radiation therapy', 'D': 'Turner syndrome', 'E': 'Vitamin B1 deficiency'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's history of drug abuse, along with his symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea, decreased exercise tolerance, and an S3 gallop on physical examination, strongly suggest a diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by dilatation of the ventricles and impaired systolic function, leading to heart failure. Chronic cocaine use is a recognized cause of dilated cardiomyopathy. 

Option 'C' Radiation therapy, can also cause dilated cardiomyopathy. Radiation induces fibrosis and vascular injury, which can result in myocardial damage and eventually cardiomyopathy. 

Option 'A' Amyloid production can cause restrictive cardiomyopathy, not dilated. In this case, amyloid protein is deposited in the heart tissue, causing stiffness and preventing the ventricles from properly filling with blood. 

Option 'B' Myosin mutation, is associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, not dilated. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is characterized by asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, often with greatest involvement of the interventricular septum.

Option 'D' Turner syndrome, is associated with coarctation of the aorta and bicuspid aortic valve, not dilated cardiomyopathy.

Option 'E' Vitamin B1 deficiency, also known as beriberi, can cause wet beriberi, which is characterized by high output heart failure, not dilated cardiomyopathy. The high output failure is due to peripheral vasodilation and increased venous return, not a primary issue with the myocardium itself.

8726,"This patient's dry cough, which started after initiating lisinopril, suggests a diagnosis of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced cough. ACE inhibitors, such as lisinopril, can cause cough by increasing levels of bradykinin in the respiratory tract. Normally, ACE inactivates bradykinin, a potent vasodilator that also increases vascular permeability and stimulates cough receptors in the lungs. Thus, inhibition of ACE leads to an accumulation of bradykinin, which can cause a persistent, dry, non-productive cough, as seen in this patient.

Option 'A': 'Serum levels of bradykinin will be elevated' is the correct answer because bradykinin levels can increase in patients taking ACE inhibitors, leading to side effects such as cough.

Option 'B': 'Loratadine would best treat her chief complaint' is incorrect. Loratadine, an antihistamine, is used to treat allergic reactions, not ACE inhibitor-induced cough.

Option 'C': 'Beta agonists would relieve this patients symptoms' is incorrect. Beta agonists are used to treat bronchospasm in conditions such as asthma, but they do not treat ACE inhibitor-induced cough.

1509,"The patient's symptoms of palpitations, diarrhea, and nausea/vomiting with an elevated heart rate and low TSH suggest hyperthyroidism. The most common cause of hyperthyroidism in women of childbearing age is Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder characterized by circulating antibodies that stimulate the TSH receptor (thyrotropin receptor antibodies, or TRAb), leading to increased thyroid hormone synthesis and release.

Therefore, the most useful test in this case would be option E, ""Thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb)."" This test will help confirm a diagnosis of Graves' disease.

Now let's see why the other options are not as appropriate:

Option A, ""Total triiodothyronine (T3) levels,"" is not the best choice because T3 levels can be normal in early or mild hyperthyroidism. T4 is converted to T3 in peripheral tissues, so it is T4 that is initially increased in hyperthyroidism. 

Option B, ""Free thyroxine (T4) levels,"" could indeed be elevated in hyperthyroidism. However, we already know from the provided lab results that this patient's total T4 levels are elevated, indicating an increased amount of circulating thyroid hormone. 

Option C, ""Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) levels,"" is not the best choice because TBG levels are not typically affected in Graves' disease. TBG levels can increase in pregnancy, but this would not explain this patient's symptoms.

Option D, ""Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies,"" are often present in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease, but they are not specific to Graves' disease.

9352,"The correct answer is D: Positive antihistone antibodies.

This patient's multiple miscarriages, thrombosis, and joint discomfort suggest an underlying autoimmune disorder, most likely antiphospholipid syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The patient's current medications include minocycline which is known to cause drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE). DILE presents similarly to idiopathic SLE but is typically associated with the presence of antihistone antibodies. Patients with SLE and DILE can develop antiphospholipid antibodies, which increase the risk of both arterial and venous thromboses and recurrent pregnancy loss (ie, recurrent spontaneous abortion in the first trimester or one unexplained death of a morphologically normal fetus after the 10th week of gestation). Antiphospholipid antibodies are also associated with thrombocytopenia and prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time.

Options B and C are incorrect because factor V mutations and syphilis (indicated by a positive VDRL) can lead to recurrent pregnancy loss, but the patient's thrombosis, joint pain, and medication history make DILE more likely. 

Option E is incorrect as although smoking can cause vasoconstriction and reduce placental blood flow, leading to complications such as preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, and placental abruption, it is less likely to cause recurrent early pregnancy loss.

Coarctation of the aorta is a congenital heart defect characterized by narrowing of the aorta distal to the left subclavian artery, leading to differential cyanosis (lower extremity cyanosis with normal upper extremity perfusion). This leads to higher blood pressure in the upper extremities than the lower extremities, and delayed/weak femoral pulses. The continuous murmur in the interscapular area is from the PDA, which is providing the only source of blood flow to the lower body.

Option E, Beta-thalassemia, is a genetic disorder that results in the reduced synthesis of the beta-globin chains of hemoglobin, leading to microcytic anemia. It can cause extramedullary hematopoiesis, but the MCV (mean corpuscular volume) would be low (microcytic), making this less likely in this case."
2226,"This patient's presentation of recurrent angioedema without urticaria is suggestive of hereditary angioedema (HAE) or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema. The fact that she is on lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, makes the latter more likely. ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema is caused by an increase in bradykinin levels secondary to decreased degradation. Bradykinin is a potent vasodilator that increases vascular permeability, resulting in angioedema. Given that the symptoms can occur at any time during therapy, the diagnosis can be made even if the patient has been on ACE inhibitor therapy for years without previous issues. The mainstay of treatment is discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor (Option D). Patients who have experienced ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema should avoid all drugs in the ACE inhibitor class but may safely take angiotensin receptor blockers.

Option A (Fresh frozen plasma) and Option B (Ecallantide) are used to treat acute episodes of hereditary angioedema, not ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema.

Option C (Danazol) is used as a long-term prophylaxis for hereditary angioedema, not ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's presentation of recurrent angioedema without urticaria following exposure to ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) suggests a diagnosis of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema (ACEI-AE). ACEI-AE is due to the accumulation of bradykinin, a potent vasodilator, which can result in the rapid development of marked angioedema. Management involves discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor (Option D). In addition to discontinuation, acute episodes of AE can be treated with airway management and either C1 esterase inhibitor, ecallantide, or icatibant.

The other options are incorrect because they do not address the root cause of the angioedema.

Fresh frozen plasma (Option A) is used for hereditary angioedema, not ACEI-AE. It can potentially worsen or precipitate an attack of ACEI-AE due to the additional kininogen content.

Ecallantide (Option B) is a kallikrein inhibitor used for acute attacks of hereditary angioedema, not ACEI-AE.

Danazol (Option C) is an attenuated androgen that is used for long-term prophylaxis against attacks in patients with hereditary angioedema.

Prednisone (Option E) is a corticosteroid often used in the treatment of various allergic reactions, but it is not effective in ACEI-AE because histamine is not the main mediator in this condition.

Acute urinary retention is a urologic emergency that needs immediate catheterization. This patient's symptom could be a side effect of Pregabalin (option B), which is a medication frequently used in the treatment of neuropathic pain, such as that caused by herpes zoster (shingles). Pregabalin has anticholinergic effects, which can lead to urinary retention, particularly in men with BPH.

Subdural hematomas typically develop over the cerebral convexities due to tearing of the bridging veins that traverse the subdural space to drain into the dural sinuses. Bridging veins are particularly susceptible to rupture due to shearing forces during acceleration-deceleration injuries, such as falls. Elderly patients are at an increased risk due to cerebral atrophy, which stretches and makes more vulnerable the bridging veins. 

Option A, Intracerebral hemorrhage, is less likely as this typically presents with focal neurological deficits related to the area of the brain affected. While this patient does have a gaze preference, this could be due to seizure activity. 
Option B, Cerebrospinal fluid production/absorption mismatch, typically leads to hydrocephalus, which presents with headache, nausea and vomiting, but would not be expected to cause loss of consciousness or seizures. 
Option D, Acute insufficiency of cerebral blood flow, could lead to a stroke which typically presents with focal neurological deficits and not loss of consciousness.

9921,"This patient's symptoms of early satiety, abdominal bloating, and diarrhea, along with poorly controlled diabetes (hemoglobin A1c of 13%), are suggestive of diabetic gastroparesis. Gastroparesis is a complication of diabetes that results from autonomic neuropathy affecting the stomach, leading to delayed gastric emptying. This is most often a chronic condition, and acute changes in symptoms are often related to changes in glycemic control. Symptoms can include postprandial fullness, early satiety, nausea, vomiting, bloating, and, less commonly, upper abdominal pain. Diabetic diarrhea, another complication of autonomic neuropathy, can occur and is characterized by profuse, watery, and typically nocturnal diarrhea. It's also often associated with fecal incontinence. Poor glycemic control can exacerbate both gastroparesis and diabetic diarrhea by leading to further autonomic neuropathy and directly inhibiting gastric motor function. Therefore, better glycemic control (Choice A) is the best initial treatment of this patient's diarrhea.

Option B (Elimination of dairy from the diet) is incorrect because there's no evidence that this patient has lactose intolerance or a milk protein allergy. The patient's symptoms are more likely due to his poorly controlled diabetes.

So, the correct answer is Increased GABAergic activity(B). The confusion and lethargy seen in this patient are likely due to the ""pill to calm her nerves,"" which is most likely a benzodiazepine. Benzodiazepines enhance GABA activity, a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, leading to the CNS depression seen in this patient. In contrast, symptoms of hypoglycemia (eg, diaphoresis) are not typically seen with benzodiazepines."
5453,"The correct answer is C. Positive anti-dsDNA antibodies

The patient's findings of arthritis, urinary symptoms with pyuria (likely sterile), and conjunctivitis are suggestive of reactive arthritis, a form of seronegative spondyloarthropathy. Reactive arthritis classically presents as a triad of urethritis, arthritis, and conjunctivitis, which can occur in any order, following an infection. The most common precipitating infections are sexually transmitted infections (eg, Chlamydia) and enteric infections (eg, Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, Clostridium difficile). Although the patient uses condoms inconsistently and has multiple partners, which puts him at risk for sexually transmitted infections, the arthritis in reactive arthritis is typically asymmetric and involves the lower extremities, making Chlamydia-induced reactive arthritis the most likely diagnosis. 

Option A is incorrect, a hiking trip two months ago is not directly related to his symptoms. Option B is incorrect, although gastrointestinal infections can sometimes trigger reactive arthritis, the patient does not have symptoms of norovirus gastroenteritis. Option D, chondrocalcinosis, is associated with pseudogout, not with the signs and symptoms exhibited by the patient. Option E is incorrect, HLA-B27 positive genotype is associated with an increased risk of certain diseases including ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, and others, but it's not a diagnostic and it doesn't explain his current presentation.

Anti-dsDNA antibodies (Option C) are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and given the patient's mother's history of an autoimmune disease with a malar rash (suggestive of SLE), these antibodies might be found. However, this patient's presentation is more consistent with reactive arthritis than SLE. Anti-dsDNA antibodies could be present, but they would not explain the patient's current symptoms.","stop","the correct answer is c. positive anti-dsdna antibodies

Renal disease and arthritis are two of these criteria, as are the presence of antinuclear antibodies or anti-dsDNA antibodies.

1393,"The most appropriate next step in this patient's management is 'A': Adenosine.

The patient's regular, rapid pulse and her symptoms of palpitations suggest she is experiencing a form of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), a type of narrow complex tachycardia that includes conditions such as atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT). Vagal maneuvers (including carotid sinus massage) can sometimes terminate PSVTs, but have not worked in this case.

Adenosine is often the first-line treatment for PSVT when vagal maneuvers are unsuccessful. It works by slowing conduction through the atrioventricular node, potentially interrupting the reentry circuits that cause these tachycardias.

Option 'B': Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic that works by blocking potassium channels and prolonging repolarization. Although it can be used to treat a variety of arrhythmias, it is not typically the first-line treatment for PSVT.

Option 'D': Propranolol is a non-selective beta blocker, which can slow heart rate by blocking the effects of adrenaline. However, it is not typically used for immediate rate control in PSVT.

Option 'E': Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker that slows conduction through the AV node, similar to adenosine.

This patient's presentation of a regular, narrow complex tachycardia that did not terminate with carotid sinus massage is consistent with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). PSVT is a common arrhythmia that can occur in patients of any age. It is often precipitated by alcohol, caffeine, or stress. Initial treatment of PSVT is with vagal maneuvers (eg, carotid sinus massage, Valsalva maneuver). If these maneuvers are unsuccessful in terminating the PSVT, the next step in management is administration of adenosine. Adenosine is a short-acting, endogenous nucleoside that slows conduction time through the atrioventricular (AV) node and can interrupt reentry pathways. Adenosine is first-line therapy for stable PSVT due to its rapid onset of action (seconds) and short half-life (<10 seconds).

This man's symptoms of lower back pain and bilateral thigh pain and weakness that improve with rest (also known as claudication), erectile dysfunction, and decreased femoral pulses suggest a diagnosis of aortoiliac occlusive disease. This is a form of peripheral arterial disease that affects the distal aorta and common iliac arteries and can cause symptoms of both lower extremity claudication and erectile dysfunction (Leriche syndrome).

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's symptoms of bilateral lower extremity discomfort and erectile dysfunction, which are exacerbated by walking and relieved by rest, are suggestive of neurogenic claudication due to lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). LSS is a common cause of pain and disability in patients >60 years of age, but it can also occur in younger patients with significant risk factors (eg, chronic laborers, obesity). The stenosis can lead to compression of the cauda equina nerve roots and result in a variety of symptoms including lower extremity discomfort, weakness, and numbness as well as changes in bowel/bladder function and sexual dysfunction (eg, impotence). On physical examination of patients with LSS, neurologic signs such as hyperreflexia, clonus, and bilateral Babinski signs are generally absent. However, signs of nerve root impingement such as decreased anal tone may be noted. Hence, 'Decreased anal tone' (Option E) is the correct answer.

This patient's presentation of right lower quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis is suggestive of acute appendicitis, which is the most common abdominal surgical emergency. However, in female patients of reproductive age, the differential diagnosis is broader because gynecologic pathology (e.g., ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease [PID]) can present similarly. Given the overlapping signs and symptoms among these conditions, the next best step in management is to perform a pelvic ultrasound. This non-invasive imaging can assess for gynecologic pathology and help rule in or rule out acute appendicitis, especially if a secondary sign of appendicitis (eg, periappendiceal fluid, echogenic mesentery) is present.

In contrast, a pelvic exam (Choice A) can be done, but it will not rule out the possibility of appendicitis. Also, it is less helpful in diagnosing other potential causes of right lower quadrant pain like ovarian torsion or PID, which are better evaluated with ultrasound. 

Ultrasound of the appendix (Choice C) will not help in diagnosing gynecologic conditions. Although ultrasound can be used to diagnose appendicitis, it is not as sensitive as CT scan. 

An upper gastrointestinal series or endoscopy (Choices D and E) would not be appropriate given that her symptoms are suggestive of a lower abdominal process. These procedures are typically reserved for evaluation of upper GI symptoms (e.g., dysphagia, upper abdominal pain).

9170,"The most likely immune mechanism that will function to combat this first exposure to the influenza virus is Option A: Natural killer cell-induced lysis of virus infected cells. 

Natural killer (NK) cells are part of the innate immune system and they can recognize and eliminate virus-infected cells without prior sensitization. They play a critical role during the early stages of viral infections, prior to the activation of adaptive immune responses. NK cells recognize stressed cells in the absence of antibodies and MHC, allowing for a much faster immune reaction. 

Option B is incorrect. MHC class I molecules are found on all nucleated cells and present intracellular antigens, such as viral peptides, to CD8+ T cells, not CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cells recognize peptides presented on MHC class II molecules, which are primarily found on professional antigen-presenting cells.

Option C is incorrect because, in a first exposure to a virus, the adaptive immune response is not yet activated, and specific antibodies to the virus have not yet been produced. This option would be more accurate in a secondary or subsequent exposure, when specific immunoglobulins would be present.

Option D is also incorrect. While the complement system can contribute to the lysis of virus-infected cells, its activation is typically dependent on the presence of antibodies bound to the virus, which would not be present in a primary infection.

Explanation: During an influenza infection, the immune system combats the virus through both the innate and adaptive immune responses. However, during the first exposure to the influenza virus, it is the adaptive immune response, and more specifically the humoral immunity that plays a crucial role. B cells produce specific antibodies (immunoglobulins) that bind to the free viruses and neutralize them. This not only prevents the virus from infecting the cells but also marks them for destruction by cells of the immune system.

Why the other options are wrong:

A: Natural killer cell-induced lysis of virus-infected cells does occur but is part of the innate immune response and is not as specific as the adaptive immune response. During the first exposure to a virus, the main response is from the adaptive immune system.

B: Presentation of viral peptides on MHC class I is a part of the cellular immune response and involves CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, not CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cells recognize antigens presented on MHC class II molecules.

D: Complement-mediated lysis of virus-infected cells does occur but is not the primary mechanism during a first time infection. The complement system is part of the innate immune response and is not as specific as the adaptive immune response.

10102,"The answer is A: Gallstones.

The medication being considered for this patient is a bile acid sequestrant, such as cholestyramine, colestipol, or colesevelam. These drugs work by binding bile acids in the intestine, thereby preventing their reabsorption and forcing the liver to consume more cholesterol to make new bile acids. This leads to a decrease in the patient's cholesterol levels. However, increased consumption of cholesterol to produce more bile acids can also lead to supersaturation of the bile and formation of cholesterol gallstones.

Option B, pruritis, is not a common side effect of bile acid sequestrants. It's more commonly seen in cholestatic liver diseases.

Option C, acanthosis nigricans, is not a side effect of any cholesterol-lowering medications. It's a skin condition commonly seen in patients with obesity or insulin resistance.

These drugs work by binding bile acids in the gut, thereby preventing their reabsorption and effectively forcing the liver to use more cholesterol to produce new bile acids. This can lead to a reduction in cholesterol levels. However, a potential adverse effect of these medications is the formation of gallstones. This is because bile, which is normally stored in the gallbladder, is made up of water, fats, and bile salts. By forcing the liver to use more cholesterol to produce bile salts, the balance of these components can be disrupted, leading to an increase in the concentration of cholesterol in the bile, thus setting the stage for gallstone formation.

8416,"This patient's hyperglycemia, acidosis (low bicarbonate), increased anion gap ([Na+] - [Cl- + HCO3-] = 30), and neurologic symptoms are consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is caused by an absolute or relative insulin deficiency. In the absence of insulin, glucose cannot be used as fuel, and the body metabolically shifts to the use of nearly exclusive fat metabolism through lipolysis. The free fatty acids are converted to ketone bodies (ie, Ã?-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate) in the liver. This leads to an increase in the anion gap and results in a metabolic acidosis.

Initial treatment of DKA involves aggressive hydration with normal saline, followed by insulin when the potassium >3.3 mEq/L to close the anion gap. Insulin therapy lowers glucose and turns off ketogenesis, but it also drives potassium into cells, potentially causing hypokalemia. Therefore, once the serum potassium concentration decreases to <3.3 mEq/L, potassium should be added to the IV fluids to prevent hypokalemia.

The patient's potassium of 2.9 mEq/L is already low, and insulin will further decrease it. Therefore, giving insulin without potassium would put her at risk for life-threatening arrhythmias due to severe hypokalemia. Thus, the answer is A, 'Insulin and potassium'.

Option B (normal saline and insulin) is incorrect because insulin would further lower her potassium level. Option C (normal saline and potassium) is incorrect because insulin is necessary to turn off ketogenesis. Option D (normal saline, insulin, and potassium) is incorrect because the combination does not include saline, which is necessary for rehydration. Finally, Option E (normal saline, insulin, potassium, and sodium bicarbonate) is incorrect as the use of bicarbonate in DKA is controversial and generally not recommended unless the pH is <6.9.","stop","thus, the answer is a, 'insulin and potassium'.","A","C","USMLE question: A 22-year-old woman with a history of type I diabetes mellitus presents to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and drowsiness for the past day.

DKA is most commonly triggered by infections, reduced insulin compliance, first presentation of type I diabetes, or increased insulin requirement from stress or pregnancy.

Initial treatment of DKA involves simultaneous administration of insulin and intravenous fluids. Insulin helps to suppress hepatic glucose production and lipolysis and also promotes glucose utilization in peripheral tissues. Fluids are essential to correct the severe volume depletion seen in DKA. 

Hypokalemia, as seen in this patient (K+ 2.9 mEq/L), is common during treatment as insulin drives potassium into cells. As such, if serum potassium is <3.3 mEq/L or the patient is about to receive insulin, potassium replacement should be initiated to prevent life-threatening hypokalemia. 

Therefore, the best initial step in management for this patient is Option D - Normal saline, insulin, and potassium. 

Option A is incorrect as it does not include the necessary fluid resuscitation. 
Option B is incorrect because it does not address the patient's hypokalemia.
Option C is incorrect because it does not include insulin, which is necessary to reduce blood glucose levels and suppress ketone production.

GBS is an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy that often follows a gastrointestinal or respiratory infection. Patients typically present with weakness that starts in the legs and moves upward. Sensory changes are less common but can be present. The most serious complication of GBS is respiratory failure due to paralysis of the respiratory muscles.

The best initial step in management is spirometry (option E). GBS patients should be monitored for signs of respiratory muscle weakness with twice-daily measurements of forced vital capacity and negative inspiratory force. Intubation (option B) should be done for any evidence of impending respiratory failure (forced vital capacity <20 mL/kg, negative inspiratory force <-30 cm H2O, or inability to handle secretions).

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's history of bloody diarrhea followed by ascending paralysis with sensory abnormalities is suggestive of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). GBS is often preceded by a gastrointestinal or respiratory infection and is thought to be an immune-mediated attack on peripheral nerves. Motor symptoms usually begin in the lower extremities and ascend over hours to days, and may even affect respiratory muscles, leading to potentially life-threatening respiratory failure. Deep tendon reflexes are typically decreased or absent.

The best initial step in managing this patient is to assess her respiratory function, and the most direct method for doing this is spirometry (Choice E). Specifically, forced vital capacity (FVC) and negative inspiratory force (NIF) are two easy bedside tests that can be used to assess the strength of the respiratory muscles. An FVC <20 mL/kg or an NIF <?25 cm H2O suggests impending respiratory failure and is an indication for intubation.

Intubation (Choice B) would be the correct answer if the patient showed signs of respiratory distress or had poor spirometry results. However, the patient's respiratory status is not in immediate danger with an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air and a respiratory rate of 29/min. 

Dexamethasone (Choice A) is a glucocorticoid which is not effective for GBS and is not recommended. 

IV immunoglobulin (Choice C) and plasmapheresis are both equally effective treatment options for GBS, but are not the first step in management.

8382,"This patient's history of systemic sclerosis (a connective tissue disorder associated with excessive fibrosis) along with his symptoms and findings of right ventricular pressure overload (enlarged pulmonary vessels, prominent right heart border, elevated right ventricular pressures) suggest the diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). PAH is a common complication of systemic sclerosis and is due to progressive obliteration of the pulmonary vascular bed by proliferating vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells. This leads to elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, right ventricular pressure overload, and eventually right-sided heart failure. Tadalafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor that is used to treat PAH. It acts by increasing cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) concentration, which in turn activates protein kinase G. The kinase then phosphorylates various proteins leading to sequestration of intracellular calcium and smooth muscle relaxation. Thus, the answer is C, Increased activation of protein kinase A.

Option A: Endothelin-1 receptor blockade can be beneficial in PAH. Bosentan is one such drug that works this way, but it's not the mechanism of action for tadalafil.

Option B: Decreased smooth muscle sensitivity to norepinephrine would theoretically result in vasodilation, but this is not how tadalafil operates.

Option D: Reduced transmembrane calcium current is a mechanism of some calcium channel blockers, which can be used in PAH, but this isn't the mechanism of tadalafil.

Option E: Enhanced activity of nitric oxide is involved in the mechanism of tadalafil, but it's not the most direct or primary effect. The primary effect is increased cGMP which then leads to vasodilation, partly mediated by nitric oxide.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","Tadalafil is a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor. The drug works by preventing the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) by phosphodiesterase 5 in the smooth muscle cells lining the blood vessels supplying the lungs. The increase in cGMP results in vasodilation by relaxing of smooth muscle cells. cGMP is a second messenger in the nitric oxide pathway, which is known for its role in vasodilation. Hence, the most likely mechanism of beneficial effect of tadalafil in this case is 'Increased activation of protein kinase A' (Option C), as cGMP activates protein kinase G, which then leads to activation of protein kinase A, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation.

Option 'A' is incorrect as blockade of endothelin-1 binding at the endothelin receptor is the mechanism of action of drugs like bosentan, not tadalafil. Endothelin-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor.

Option 'B' is incorrect as tadalafil does not have any significant effect on the sensitivity of smooth muscles to norepinephrine. 

Option 'D' is incorrect as reduction of transmembrane calcium current is not the primary mechanism of action of tadalafil. This is more characteristic of calcium channel blockers.

Cytokines are protein molecules that are released by immune cells and play a crucial role in cell signaling during immune responses. Certain cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukins, can stimulate the inflammatory response in vascular endothelial cells, which may trigger plaque rupture leading to myocardial infarction. Therefore, the presence of cytokines may indicate an ongoing inflammatory process that can predict myocardial necrosis.

Option 'A': 'Cholesterol crystal presence' is incorrect because cholesterol crystals are a part of atheromatous plaques that contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease, but their presence does not necessarily predict myocardial necrosis.

Option 'B': 'Rate of plaque formation' is incorrect as it is more related to the progression of atherosclerosis rather than acute plaque rupture that leads to myocardial necrosis.

Option 'C': 'Calcium content' is incorrect because although calcium can be a component of atheromatous plaques, it is not a direct predictor of myocardial necrosis. 

Option 'E': 'Amount of foam cells' is incorrect because foam cells are indicative of atherosclerosis, not of the imminent risk of myocardial necrosis. Foam cells are formed when macrophages consume low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and become laden with lipid (fat), but the amount of foam cells does not necessarily correlate with the risk of myocardial infarction or necrosis.

This patient's CT scan shows an intracranial bleed, a complication of anticoagulation. She is on warfarin, which works by inhibiting vitamin K recycling, thereby depleting active vitamin K and reducing the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X). 

Spinach (choice D) is rich in vitamin K, and its intake can cause a marked decrease in the international normalized ratio (INR), thereby reducing the effectiveness of warfarin and leading to a prothrombotic state. If a patient on warfarin therapy suddenly starts eating large amounts of spinach, this could potentially lead to the development of thrombotic events, such as ischemic stroke or venous thromboembolism. In this patient, the reduced effectiveness of warfarin may have resulted in an ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic transformation, leading to the intracranial bleed seen on CT.

The patient in the vignette is on warfarin for stroke prevention. Warfarin is an anticoagulant that works by inhibiting vitamin K-dependent clotting factors in the liver. Thus, dietary changes that increase vitamin K intake can interfere with the effectiveness of warfarin, leading to a decreased anticoagulant effect and an increased risk for thromboembolic events. Green leafy vegetables such as spinach are high in vitamin K and if consumed in large amounts, can potentially counteract the effects of warfarin. This could have led to the intracranial bleed seen in this patient.

Now let's discuss why the other options are incorrect:

'A': St. John?s wort: This is a plant that's often used as a dietary supplement for depression. It can reduce the effectiveness of many drugs, including warfarin, by inducing cytochrome P450 enzymes. However, this would likely result in increased thrombosis rather than bleeding.

'B': Chili peppers: These don't significantly interact with warfarin.

'C': Grapefruit juice: This can actually increase the effectiveness of warfarin by inhibiting cytochrome P450 enzymes, thereby increasing risk of bleeding. However, the vignette doesn't suggest that the patient is over-anticoagulated (which could cause an intracranial bleed), but rather under-anticoagulated due to vitamin K intake.

Option C: Treponema pallidum is the causative organism of syphilis, which typically presents with a painless ulcer (chancre) and regional lymphadenopathy. The ulcer and lymphadenopathy of syphilis are usually painless, which is not consistent with this patient's presentation.

Option D: Herpes simplex virus 2 could cause painful genital ulcers, but associated systemic symptoms such as fever and malaise would typically be present, and the ulcers would be smaller and more vesicular in nature. 

Option E: Haemophilus ducreyi causes chancroid, a sexually transmitted infection characterized by painful genital ulcers and painful inguinal lymphadenopathy. However, the ulcers of chancroid are typically described as having a ""dirty gray"" or ""yellowish gray"" color and the ulcer base would not be necrotic."
1798,"The patient's presentation is consistent with Burkitt lymphoma, which is characterized by sheets of lymphocytes and ""starry sky"" appearance from reactive histiocytes (macrophages) phagocytosing apoptotic debris. It is common in children and young adults, especially from Africa.

5098,"The most likely diagnosis for this patient is option D: Dopamine blockade in the tuberoinfundibular pathway. 

This patient's nipple discharge and decreased libido are suggestive of hyperprolactinemia. Prolactin is normally inhibited by dopamine which is released from the hypothalamus and travels through the tuberoinfundibular pathway to the anterior pituitary gland. The most common cause of hyperprolactinemia in a premenopausal woman is a prolactinoma (option C), but this patient's history of schizophrenia suggests that she may be taking an antipsychotic medication. Many antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone) are dopamine antagonists and can therefore block dopamine action in the tuberoinfundibular pathway, causing an increase in prolactin levels.

Option A: Viral infection of the thyroid gland and Option B: Autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland would typically present with symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, which this patient does not have.

This patient's symptoms of galactorrhea (nipple discharge), fatigue, decreased libido, and recent weight gain suggest a prolactin-secreting pituitary mass or hyperprolactinemia. The pituitary gland is responsible for producing prolactin, which stimulates breastmilk production. Prolactin secretion is typically inhibited by dopamine, which is produced in the hypothalamus and transmitted to the pituitary gland along the tuberoinfundibular pathway. Antipsychotic medications, which are commonly used to treat schizophrenia, block dopamine receptors, thereby decreasing the inhibitory effect on prolactin and leading to an increase in prolactin levels. This process can manifest as galactorrhea, decreased libido, and menstrual irregularities.

The other options are wrong because:

A: Viral infection of the thyroid gland could cause thyroiditis, with symptoms like pain, fever, and hyper- or hypothyroid symptoms, which are not present in this case.

B: Autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland refers to Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which would present with hypothyroid symptoms like cold intolerance, weight gain, and constipation. However, it would not cause galactorrhea.

C: Protein-secreting CNS mass could cause a variety of symptoms depending on the location of the mass and the specific protein being overproduced, but this is less likely than option D given the patient's history of schizophrenia and the specific symptom constellation.

1891,"The answer is D: Wrinkled forehead

The patient's presentation of sudden onset unilateral facial weakness involving the entire face (including the forehead) is suggestive of Bell's palsy. Bell's palsy is a lower motor neuron paralysis of the facial nerve (CN VII) and it causes weakness of all the muscles of facial expression on the affected side. The forehead is also involved in Bell's palsy because the upper facial muscles (including the frontalis muscle which wrinkles the forehead) receive bilateral upper motor neuron input. In contrast, a stroke (which is an upper motor neuron lesion) would cause contralateral weakness sparing the forehead because of the intact contralateral (unaffected side) upper motor neuron input to the forehead.

The other options are less likely given the patient's presentation:

Option A: Decreased salivation is not typically seen in Bell's palsy. The salivary glands are innervated by the autonomic nervous system, not by the facial nerve.

Option B: Partial hearing loss is not typically associated with Bell's palsy. The facial nerve does not play a role in hearing.

Option C: Complete loss of taste to the tongue is not seen in Bell's palsy. While the facial nerve does carry taste sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, Bell's palsy would not cause a complete loss of taste.

The patient's symptoms of acute onset facial droop involving the entire half of the face, with preserved sensation, are suggestive of a peripheral lesion of the facial nerve (Bell's palsy), rather than a stroke. Stroke typically results in facial weakness sparing the forehead due to bilateral upper motor neuron innervation to the forehead muscles. This is contrasted with a Bell's palsy where there is a lower motor neuron lesion of the facial nerve, resulting in complete paralysis of all muscles on one side of the face, including the forehead. Hence, a wrinkled forehead (option D) on the unaffected side would be expected. 

Option A is incorrect as Bell's palsy may actually cause increased tearing and salivation due to faulty reinnervation.

Option B is incorrect as while Bell's palsy can affect the nerve to stapedius (a small muscle in the ear) which can alter sound conduction and cause hyperacusis (increased sensitivity to sound), it doesn't cause partial hearing loss.

Option C is incorrect as the anterior two-thirds of the tongue is supplied by the facial nerve for taste. A complete loss of taste would require involvement of the glossopharyngeal nerve (posterior third of tongue) and the vagus nerve (very back of tongue) as well, which is not the case here.

The use of oral contraceptives increases the risk of hepatic adenoma due to the estrogenic effect on hepatocytes. 

Chronic alcohol abuse (Choice A) is a risk factor for alcoholic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma, not hepatic adenomas. 

Extrahepatic malignancy (Choice B) can metastasize to the liver, but this usually results in multiple lesions rather than a solitary mass.

This patient's presentation of prolonged chest pain unresponsive to nitroglycerin, ST-segment elevations, and subsequent reperfusion is indicative of a myocardial infarction (MI). After an MI, the necrotic myocardium undergoes a predictable sequence of histologic changes.

- Within the first 24 hours, coagulation necrosis begins and neutrophils start to infiltrate the necrotic tissue (thus, choice A is incorrect because it occurs too early).
- By 3-14 days post-MI, macrophages have removed most of the necrotic tissue. Granulation tissue, which appears red and granular, is present at the margins of the infarct. It consists of fibroblasts, blood vessels (capillaries), and connective tissue. Hence, this is what we would expect to see at around 3 weeks.
- After 2 weeks, granulation tissue begins to be replaced by collagen deposited by fibroblasts, leading to a mature, white, fibrous scar that takes about 6-8 weeks to fully form (choice C is incorrect because it occurs too late).
- Choice D (Pale infarcted tissue) is incorrect, because this is a description of what the tissue looks like immediately after the infarction, before the inflammatory process has begun.

This deficiency leads to complement-mediated hemolysis, as seen in this patient (e.g., anemia, elevated LDH, low haptoglobin, hyperbilirubinemia).

The most common cause of mortality in patients with PNH is thrombosis, specifically in the unusual locations like hepatic, abdominal, cerebral, and subdermal veins. The release of free hemoglobin from destroyed red cells, which can deplete nitric oxide, is believed to be the cause of the hypercoagulable state. Nitric oxide is a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Therefore, the answer is Cerebral vein thrombosis (Option C).

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's presentation of chronic symptoms (eg, fatigue, erectile dysfunction), acute abdominal pain after alcohol use, and laboratory evidence of hemolysis, combined with pancytopenia and a reticulocyte count lower than expected for the degree of anemia, is suggestive of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). PNH is an acquired stem cell disorder causing hemolytic anemia, bone marrow failure (ie, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia), and a hypercoagulable state. It is characterized by somatic mutation of the PIGA gene in a hematopoietic stem cell, resulting in defective production of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. As a result, GPI-anchored proteins (CD55 and CD59) are deficient on blood cells, leading to complement-mediated lysis. PNH can manifest with hemolytic anemia, cytopenias, and thrombosis. Thrombotic events occur in 30%-50% of patients and are the most common cause of death. Thrombosis commonly affects hepatic veins (Budd-Chiari syndrome), but also occurs in abdominal veins and cerebral veins (Option C).

Infection (Option A) and hemorrhage (Option B) are possible causes of mortality in PNH due to bone marrow failure, but thrombotic events are more common.
High-output cardiac failure (Option D) is a potential outcome in severe chronic hemolytic anemia. Although hemolysis may be evident (eg, low haptoglobin, elevated LDH, indirect bilirubinemia), the anemia is typically moderate and does not usually result in high-output cardiac failure.
Budd-Chiari syndrome (Option E) is a potential complication of PNH, but cerebral vein thrombosis is more common."

Vaginal progesterone is indicated in patients with a singleton gestation, prior spontaneous preterm birth, and a short transvaginal ultrasound cervical length (<20 mm before or at 24 weeks' gestation). It reduces the risk of preterm birth before 37, 34, and 28 weeks' gestation, and reduces perinatal mortality.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's history of a previous spontaneous abortion at 22 weeks and preterm delivery at 24 weeks puts her at high risk for another preterm birth. Preterm birth occurs in ~12% of all pregnancies and is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Risk factors for preterm birth include prior preterm birth, multiple gestations, uterine/cervical abnormalities, and certain infections (eg, bacterial vaginosis).
A short cervical length (<25 mm) on transvaginal ultrasound before 24 weeks of gestation is a powerful predictor of spontaneous preterm birth. The use of progesterone in patients with a history of spontaneous preterm birth (singletons) and/or a short cervical length (singletons and multiples) has been shown to reduce the risk of preterm birth.
Intramuscular progesterone (option C) is used in patients with a history of prior spontaneous preterm birth but a normal cervical length. Vaginal progesterone (option E) is used in patients with a short cervix (history of preterm birth is not required). Vaginal progesterone is as effective as cerclage (option A) in these patients and has fewer complications.

Option B (Cervical pessary) is not recommended as routine care in women with a short cervix because it has not been shown to reduce the risk of preterm birth.

Now, let's discuss why the other options are incorrect:

Choice B: Inserting a progestin-containing intra-uterine device is not an appropriate step in this case. Although it can be used for emergency contraception, it is more invasive and not first-line in this setting.

Choice C: Mifepristone is a medication that blocks the effects of progesterone. It is used with misoprostol to induce abortion in early pregnancy, not as a post-coital contraceptive.

It is more effective than levonorgestrel (another option for emergency contraception) and can be used up to 120 hours after intercourse. 

Option B, Insert progestin-containing intra-uterine device, would not be appropriate as the patient does not wish for her parents to be informed of the visit and this procedure would likely require parental consent, given the patient's age.

Option C, Administer mifepristone, is used for medical abortions rather than as a preventative measure. 

Option D, Administer combined oral contraceptive, would not be effective as emergency contraception. Regular oral contraceptives work by preventing ovulation, but if ovulation has already occurred, they would not prevent pregnancy. 

Option E, Insert copper-containing intra-uterine device, would also not be appropriate for similar reasons to option B. It requires an invasive procedure and also may need parental consent given the patient's age.

2140,"This patient's hyperglycemia, acidemia (low serum bicarbonate), increased anion gap, and positive urine ketones suggest a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The initial treatment of DKA involves intravenous fluids and insulin. Insulin stops ketogenesis, decreases glucose production by the liver, and enhances glucose uptake into cells. In DKA, fluids are necessary due to the osmotic diuresis that occurs, leading to severe volume depletion. 

Since the patient has already received saline and insulin, the next step is careful monitoring and replacement of potassium. DKA patients are invariably potassium-depleted, even if initial serum potassium levels are normal or high. Insulin and glucose promote the movement of potassium from the extracellular fluid into the cells, potentially leading to life-threatening hypokalemia. 

So, the most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous potassium chloride (Option D).

Option A is incorrect because this patient needs intravenous insulin, not subcutaneous insulin. Subcutaneous insulin glargine is a long-acting insulin that would take too long to have an effect in a critical situation like DKA. 

Option B is incorrect because the patient has already received an initial bolus of isotonic saline. 

Option C is wrong because sodium bicarbonate is not routinely recommended for DKA treatment. It is only given in extreme cases when the pH is less than 6.9.

Option E is incorrect because 5% dextrose with 1/2 isotonic saline is typically added to the treatment regimen when glucose is <200 mg/dL to prevent hypoglycemia.","stop","so, the most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous potassium chloride (option d).","D","D","USMLE question: A 19-year-old man with unknown medical history is found down on a subway platform and is brought to the hospital by ambulance.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's hyperglycemia, ketonuria, and anion gap metabolic acidosis (Na+ - [Cl- + HCO3-] = 16 mEq/L) are suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is caused by absolute or relative insulin deficiency. Lack of insulin results in hyperglycemia, volume depletion due to osmotic diuresis, and a shift from carbohydrate to fat metabolism. This last mechanism results in the production of ketone bodies, which, along with lactic acid, contribute to a high anion gap metabolic acidosis.

Initial treatment for DKA includes insulin and aggressive fluid resuscitation with isotonic saline to restore intravascular volume and decrease counterregulatory hormones, which will decrease ketogenesis. Insulin will decrease serum glucose levels and suppress ketogenesis. Therefore, when glucose levels decrease to <250 mg/dL, 5% dextrose should be added to the maintenance fluid to allow continued insulin administration until ketogenesis has stopped, while avoiding hypoglycemia. Consequently, the most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous 5% dextrose and 1/2 isotonic saline (Option E). The administration of sodium bicarbonate is generally not recommended because it does not improve outcomes and can potentially cause harm (Option C). In addition, this patient's potassium level is currently normal, so there is no need to administer potassium chloride (Option D). Subcutaneous insulin glargine is a long-acting insulin that is used for maintenance therapy in stable diabetic patients (Option A). It is not used in the acute management of DKA as it does not have a rapid onset of action."
2314,"This patient's fever, chest pain exacerbated by inspiration, recent sore throat, elevated antistreptolysin O titer, and subcutaneous nodules are consistent with acute rheumatic fever (ARF). ARF is a sequela of Group A Streptococcus pharyngitis and not a result of direct infection. Instead, it represents an abnormal autoimmune response to the infecting organism. The mitral valve is most commonly affected and mitral regurgitation is the most common murmur heard, often described as an apical holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla. The murmur in this case may be too soft to cause a typical holosystolic murmur.
ARF can cause rheumatic heart disease (RHD), which can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, following an episode of ARF, secondary prophylaxis with regular benzathine penicillin G injections every 4 weeks is recommended to prevent Group A Streptococcus reinfection and recurrence of ARF. The duration of prophylaxis depends on the presence and severity of carditis and the time from the last episode of ARF.
In this patient, who is diagnosed with carditis but has no residual heart disease (as evidenced by the normal echocardiogram), prophylaxis until age 21 or for 10 years (whichever is longer) is recommended, making option D the correct choice.
Option A is wrong because 10 years of prophylaxis may not be sufficient if she is still under 21. Options B and E are wrong because they do not provide sufficient duration of prophylaxis.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The patient's history of sore throat, fever, subcutaneous nodules, endocarditis (as evidenced by the new murmur), arthralgia, and elevated antistreptolysin O titer indicate a diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) secondary to group A streptococcal infection. ARF is an autoimmune response against the M protein of the Streptococcus bacterium, which cross-reacts with proteins in human tissues, especially the heart, joints, subcutaneous tissues, and central nervous system. The immune response can result in permanent heart valve damage, predominantly of the mitral valve but also of the aortic valve.

Patients with a history of ARF are at increased risk for recurrent episodes, which can cause or worsen rheumatic heart disease. To prevent recurrent ARF, patients are given continuous antibiotic prophylaxis against Streptococcus. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be continued until the patient is 21 years of age or for at least 5 years after the last episode, whichever is longer (option D). Therefore, the correct answer is intramuscular benzathine penicillin every 4 weeks until the age of 21.

Options A, C, and E suggest different durations of prophylaxis, which would be inappropriate given the patient's age and clinical history. Option B, low-dose prednisone therapy for a month, would not be the appropriate next step in management, as it would not prevent future episodes of ARF. Although corticosteroids may be used in severe cases of ARF with carditis and heart failure, there's no evidence of severe carditis in this patient. Therefore, the focus should be on prophylaxis to prevent recurrent ARF and rheumatic heart disease."
5296,"The patient's arterial blood gas reveals a primary metabolic acidosis (low bicarbonate), evidenced by a low pH and low bicarbonate. The low PCO2 is due to compensatory hyperventilation. The reduced bicarbonate level in the context of recent surgery and vomiting is best explained by loss of alkaline gastric secretions, leading to the conclusion that vomiting (option B) is the most likely cause of his metabolic acidosis. 

Vomiting results in loss of gastric HCl, causing a decrease in hydrogen ion concentration and a resulting increase in bicarbonate concentration in the serum (metabolic alkalosis). However, the kidneys compensate by increasing bicarbonate excretion and hydrogen ion reabsorption. If vomiting continues, volume contraction can occur, leading to prerenal azotemia (increased blood urea nitrogen) and stimulation of aldosterone secretion. Aldosterone causes the kidneys to reabsorb sodium in exchange for potassium and hydrogen ions, thereby exacerbating the hydrogen ion loss. Over time, this leads to a paradoxical metabolic acidosis.

The anion gap, calculated as [Na+] - ([Cl-] + [HCO3-]), is 23.5 mEq/L (reference range 8-12 mEq/L), indicating an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis. The most common causes of elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis are lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, renal failure, and toxin ingestion (eg, methanol, ethylene glycol, salicylates). 

In this case, the patient has recently undergone major surgery, which is a state of high metabolic demand. Postoperative nausea and vomiting in a patient with insulin-dependent diabetes can lead to inadequate oral intake and poor glycemic control. The resulting insulin deficiency prompts lipolysis and generation of ketone bodies (Î²-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate), which are strong organic acids that increase the anion gap. The clinical picture is consistent with ketoacidosis (choice C) due to starvation and stress of surgery. 

Uremia (choice A) can cause an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis due to retention of organic acids, but this is usually seen in chronic kidney disease with significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (eg, creatinine >4 mg/dL).

Diabetes is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease in the United States. In addition to hypertension, diabetes causes glomerulosclerosis, which can lead to albuminuria and a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate, as seen in this patient. The development of CKD in patients with diabetes usually occurs 10-20 years after the onset of diabetes. Thus, the next best test to assess possible diabetic nephropathy would be a renal biopsy (Option B). 

Option A, Renal arteriography, is usually not the first line imaging in assessing CKD because it is invasive and carries risks such as contrast-induced nephropathy.

Option C, Urine protein electrophoresis, is useful in determining the cause of proteinuria when it is unclear, such as in suspected multiple myeloma or nephrotic syndrome. However, in this case, the cause of the proteinuria is likely diabetes.

Option D, Renal computed tomography, is not typically used to assess CKD. It is more useful for identifying anatomical abnormalities such as renal masses or stones.

Option E, No further renal tests are required, is incorrect because the patient's symptoms, urinalysis results, and decreased GFR suggest CKD, which needs further evaluation."
71,"The patient's presentation is consistent with celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation and villous atrophy in the small intestine in response to ingestion of gluten. Symptoms of malabsorption, such as diarrhea and weight loss, are common. Dermatitis herpetiformis (itchy, blistering skin rash) is a specific finding in celiac disease, but this patient's dry skin is a nonspecific manifestation of malnutrition. The presence of bilateral white spots on the temporal half of the conjunctiva, known as Bitot spots, signifies vitamin A deficiency secondary to fat malabsorption. Vitamin A is necessary for maintenance of specialized epithelial surfaces (eg, skin, conjunctiva). Deficiency can cause xerosis (dryness) and keratinization of the skin and conjunctiva, leading to the formation of Bitot spots. The neck mass is likely a thyroid goiter due to the associated autoimmune thyroid disease (eg, Hashimoto thyroiditis) commonly seen in patients with celiac disease. A gluten-free diet (choice A) is the mainstay of treatment in celiac disease.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's diarrhea, weight loss, and bloating suggest malabsorption. The presence of bilateral white spots on the conjunctiva (Bitot spots) indicates vitamin A deficiency, which would be consistent with fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption. The D-xylose test measures carbohydrate absorption and would be abnormal in mucosal diseases (eg, celiac disease) but normal in diseases of intraluminal digestion (eg, pancreatic insufficiency) or transit (eg, short gut). 
Additionally, the anterior neck mass that does not move with swallowing suggests thyroiditis, which can be associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as celiac disease. Celiac disease is a gluten hypersensitivity that results in inflammation and villous atrophy in the small bowel, leading to malabsorption. Therefore, a gluten-free diet is the most appropriate answer (Choice A).

8798,"The correct answer is D. Chloride channels of epithelial cells in sweat glands.

This patient's cystic fibrosis (CF) is suggested by failure to thrive in a young child and a deletion mutation in a gene on chromosome 7, which encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. CFTR is an ATP-gated chloride channel expressed in the apical membrane of many epithelial cells, including those of the sweat glands, respiratory tract, pancreatic ducts, and vas deferens. The most common CF mutation, a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (Î?F508), impairs post-translational folding of CFTR, leading to its degradation in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This results in a decrease in chloride transport across these epithelial cells. However, within sweat glands, the defect results in an increase in chloride and sodium concentration in the sweat because CFTR normally reabsorbs chloride (and sodium follows) from the sweat. This is unique to sweat glands, as most other affected glands and organs (eg, lung, pancreas) show decreased chloride secretion due to the CFTR mutation.

Option A is incorrect because bicarbonate secretion in the pancreatic ducts is decreased, not increased, in CF, leading to the development of pancreatic insufficiency. 

Option B is incorrect because calcium channel activity in the distal tubules is not associated with CFTR.

Option C is incorrect because sodium reabsorption in the respiratory epithelium is increased in CF due to the failure of CFTR-dependent chloride secretion; this causes water to move out of the airway surface liquid layer, leading to dehydrated mucus that can obstruct the airways.

Option E is incorrect because potassium channels of pancreatic beta cells are not associated with CFTR.","stop","the correct answer is d. chloride channels of epithelial cells in sweat glands.","D","C","USMLE question: An 11-year-old boy who recently emigrated from Ukraine is brought to the physician for the evaluation of failure to thrive.

The activity of which of the following channels is most likely to be increased as a result of the defect?
Option: {'A': 'Bicarbonate channels of pancreatic ductal cells', 'B': 'Calcium channels of distal tubular cells', 'C': 'Sodium channels of respiratory epithelial cells', 'D': 'Chloride channels of epithelial cells in sweat glands', 'E': 'ATP-sensitive potassium channels of pancreatic beta cells\n""'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The answer is D. 'Chloride channels of epithelial cells in sweat glands'.

The patient's deletion of the 508th codon on a gene on chromosome 7 is consistent with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene, which is located on chromosome 7. The most common mutation is a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508, which disrupts protein folding and leads to degradation of the misfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. This results in fewer CFTR channels at the cell surface. 

CFTR is an ATP-gated chloride channel that is expressed in the epithelial cells of various organs, including the lungs, pancreas, sweat glands, and intestines. In the sweat glands, CFTR normally reabsorbs chloride from the sweat duct, resulting in sweat that is low in sodium and chloride. However, in CF, defective CFTR channels lead to decreased reabsorption of chloride and consequently increased concentration of chloride (and sodium, which follows chloride passively) in the sweat. This phenomenon is the basis for the sweat chloride test, which is used to diagnose CF.

Option A is incorrect as bicarbonate channels of pancreatic ductal cells are affected but the result is decreased, not increased activity. Option B is incorrect as calcium channels of distal tubular cells are not directly affected in CF. Option C is incorrect as sodium channels of respiratory epithelial cells are also affected, but the result is a decrease in activity, not an increase. Option E is incorrect as ATP-sensitive potassium channels of pancreatic beta cells are not directly affected in CF."
1867,"This patient's nosebleed, petechiae, purpura, and prolonged bleeding time in the setting of a normal platelet count suggest a qualitative platelet disorder. Glanzmann thrombasthenia (choice C) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect in platelet aggregation due to a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. This glycoprotein is a receptor for fibrinogen, and its absence impairs the platelets' ability to cross-link with each other. Patients present with mucocutaneous bleeding (eg, epistaxis, gingival bleeding), menorrhagia, and with a normal platelet count, normal morphology on peripheral smear, and prolonged bleeding time.

Decreased levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF) (choice A) would likely cause von Willebrand disease, the most common inherited bleeding disorder. However, patients typically have a normal bleeding time and platelet count. They do, however, have an increased PTT due to vWF's stabilizing effect on factor VIII.

5439,"The correct answer is A. The patient's history of painless vaginal bleeding and previous cesarean deliveries, along with ultrasound findings suggestive of a low-lying placenta, are consistent with placenta previa. The placenta previa is a placental implantation in the lower uterine segment, either completely covering the internal os (complete placenta previa) or near the os but not covering it (marginal or partial previa). Placenta previa is a major risk factor for peripartum hemorrhage and it is especially dangerous in patients with prior cesarean delivery due to the risk of placenta accreta spectrum disorders.

For patients with persistent placenta previa beyond 36 weeks, a scheduled cesarean delivery at 36-37 weeks gestation after administration of corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity is generally recommended. This is because labor or vaginal delivery could lead to significant hemorrhage.

Option B is incorrect because vaginal delivery is contraindicated in placenta previa due to the risk of significant peripartum bleeding. Option C is incorrect because placenta previa is a major risk factor for peripartum hemorrhage, regardless of whether significant antepartum bleeding has occurred.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's history of painless vaginal spotting and ultrasound findings (anterior placenta 1.5 cm from the internal cervical os) are consistent with placenta previa. Placenta previa is a condition in which the placenta implants over or near the cervical os and can cause painless antepartum bleeding in the second half of pregnancy. It is a risk factor for maternal hemorrhage and requires delivery by cesarean section. Given this patient's history of prior cesarean sections, an additional concern is placenta accreta spectrum (PAS), a condition in which the placenta grows too deeply into the uterine wall. Prior cesarean section and placenta previa are two major risk factors for PAS. Although this patient has not had significant bleeding, it remains a possibility, especially during delivery. 

Option A is the correct management strategy. In the setting of placenta previa after 20 weeks gestation, delivery should be planned via cesarean section at 36-37 weeks to avoid labor and its associated contractions, which could lead to severe bleeding. 

Option B is incorrect because attempting vaginal delivery in the setting of placenta previa risks life-threatening hemorrhage. 

Option C is incorrect because placenta previa and PAS are both risk factors for significant antepartum and postpartum bleeding.

Option D is incorrect because the decision for cesarean delivery is based on the location of the placenta and not on the fetal lung maturity.

5456,"The correct answer is E. Microcytic anemia.

Chronic alcohol abuse can lead to numerous health problems, including nutritional deficiencies. One common deficiency associated with chronic alcohol abuse is iron deficiency, which leads to microcytic anemia (option E). Microcytic anemia is characterized by small, pale red blood cells. Iron is needed for hemoglobin production, and without sufficient iron, the body cannot produce enough hemoglobin, leading to anemia. 

Option A, Constipation, is not typically associated with chronic alcohol abuse. Alcohol can affect the gastrointestinal system, but it often leads to diarrhea rather than constipation. 

Option B, Decreased CNS NMDA activity, is incorrect because chronic alcohol abuse actually increases NMDA activity. NMDA receptors are involved in the development of alcohol dependence and withdrawal symptoms. 

Option C, Dysdiadochokinesia, is a symptom of cerebellar dysfunction, such as ataxia, and is not directly related to alcohol abuse. 

Option D, Increased transketolase activity, is also incorrect. Chronic alcohol abuse often leads to thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency because alcohol affects the absorption and storage of thiamine.

Alcohol abuse is known to cause a variety of hematologic disorders due to nutritional deficiencies, liver damage, bone marrow suppression, increased bleeding tendencies, and altered red blood cell production. Microcytic anemia, rather than the normocytic anemia more commonly associated with alcoholism, might be seen in this patient due to concomitant iron deficiency from poor diet or gastrointestinal bleeding, or from the direct toxic effect of alcohol on the red blood cells. 

Let's discuss why the other options are incorrect:

A: Constipation - Alcohol is more likely to cause diarrhea than constipation due to its effect of speeding up digestion by increasing peristalsis.

B: Decreased CNS NMDA activity - Chronic alcohol use actually results in increased CNS NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) activity, not decreased. This is part of the reason why withdrawal from alcohol can lead to seizures.

C: Dysdiadochokinesia - This term describes an impaired ability to perform rapid, alternating movements and is often seen in conditions that affect the cerebellum, like multiple sclerosis or stroke. While alcoholism can lead to cerebellar degeneration, this is less common than the other pathologies listed.

D: Increased transketolase activity - This is not associated with alcohol abuse. Transketolase is an enzyme involved in the pentose phosphate pathway. Decreased activity (not increased) can be seen in thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency, which can occur in alcoholics due to malnutrition.

497,"The question presents a young woman with frequent fainting episodes since childhood, palpitations, shortness of breath, occasional chest pain, and tachycardia, suggesting a long-standing cardiac arrhythmia. The first-line treatment for many such arrhythmias is a sodium channel blocker like Flecainide (option C). 

This woman's symptoms (e.g., chest pain, shortness of breath, tachycardia) are suggestive of a ventricular arrhythmia. Flecainide is a class 1C antiarrhythmic that works by blocking fast sodium channels, which slows the rapid upstroke of the action potential, ultimately leading to a decrease in conduction velocity in cardiac tissue.

ARDS is characterized by severe inflammation and increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary barrier, leading to protein-rich fluid leakage into the alveoli, impairment of gas exchange, and the need for mechanical ventilation. The initial insult in ARDS damages the Type I pneumocytes (therefore option A is incorrect) which cover a majority of the alveolar surface and are responsible for gas exchange. 

Type II pneumocytes, while less abundant, are not as affected in ARDS and proliferate during lung injury, eventually differentiating into Type I cells to replace the damaged ones. These cells produce surfactant and contribute to reducing surface tension at the air-liquid interface in the alveoli, helping prevent alveolar collapse.

A chest X-ray (option C) in ARDS typically shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates (so it's not normal). The alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient (option D), which is the difference between the alveolar and arterial partial pressures of O2, is typically elevated in ARDS due to impairments in gas exchange (so it's not normal). Left atrial pressure (option E) is often normal in ARDS, however, the presence of crackles in this case may suggest the development of ventilator-induced lung injury with subsequent increase in pulmonary capillary pressure and transudation of fluid (so possibly it's not normal)."

The principle of autonomy allows competent adults to refuse medical treatment for any reason, even if the decision may lead to their death. However, this principle does not apply to minors. When a parent refuses life-saving treatment for a child due to religious beliefs, it is considered medical neglect. Courts typically side with medical professionals who are advocating for the child's life or health over the parents' religious beliefs. Thus, the physician should seek a court order to overrule the parents' decision and provide the necessary life-saving treatment.

Her sudden collapse with loss of consciousness and absent pulses indicates cardiac arrest. The unspecified cardiac rhythm likely indicates ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT), which are the most common initial rhythms in cardiac arrest, especially in the context of acute MI. VF/VT leads to the loss of effective cardiac output and abrupt loss of consciousness. Defibrillation (option B) is therefore the most appropriate next step in management.

In VF/VT, immediate defibrillation is the treatment of choice as it has the best chance to restore normal rhythm and pulse. Epinephrine (option D) is often used after defibrillation to maximize coronary and cerebral perfusion pressures during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but it should not delay defibrillation.

Coronary angiography (option C) would be considered only after the patient is hemodynamically stable and not in cardiac arrest since it is both diagnostic and therapeutic for acute MI but does not address the immediate life-threatening condition of cardiac arrest.

The patient's presentation is consistent with acute decompensated heart failure, characterized by symptoms such as dyspnea, pulmonary crackles, and jugular venous distension. These findings are indicative of fluid overload. The treatment of choice in this setting is a loop diuretic like furosemide, which can relieve symptoms quickly by promoting diuresis. However, another class of drugs used to manage symptoms in acute decompensated heart failure is nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin is a venodilator that works primarily by decreasing preload, which reduces the volume of blood the heart has to pump, thereby reducing the workload of the heart and alleviating symptoms.

Option A: The primary goal of treatment in this patient is to alleviate symptoms of fluid overload, not respiratory depression.

Option C and D: The patient's acute decompensated heart failure is most likely secondary to his history of myocardial infarctions. Increasing cardiac contractility (as with inotropes like dobutamine) would increase oxygen demand and could potentially exacerbate myocardial ischemia. 

Option E: Chronic use of loop diuretics can lead to nephrogenic adaptations that decrease their efficacy, but in the context of acute decompensated heart failure, the immediate benefits of diuresis and symptom relief outweigh these concerns.

If arrest of dilation persists 2 hours after amniotomy despite adequate contractions, then a diagnosis of failed induction is made and cesarean delivery should be performed. If contractions remain inadequate, augmentation with oxytocin is indicated.

Option 'A': Begin active pushing is incorrect because the woman is not fully dilated at 10 cm. Pushing before full dilation can lead to cervical edema and prolong labor.

Option 'B': Retry maternal repositioning is done typically when there are nonreassuring fetal heart tracings, which is not the case here.

Option 'C': Administer tocolytics is incorrect because tocolytics are used to inhibit preterm labor, not to manage arrest of dilation in active labor.

Option 'E': Emergent cesarean delivery is incorrect because cesarean delivery is indicated for failed induction (ie, no cervical change after at least 2 hours of adequate uterine contractions following amniotomy), which is not the case here."
9344,"This patient's hypotonia, poor suckling, vomiting, abnormal movements, eczema, fair skin, red hair, blue eyes, and laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency. AADC is responsible for the conversion of L-dopa to dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptophan to serotonin, thus a deficiency leads to decreased levels of both of these neurotransmitters as seen in this patient's lab results (low homovanillic acid, a dopamine metabolite, and serotonin). The increased prolactin can be explained by the lack of dopamine, which normally inhibits prolactin release. High phenylalanine levels can be seen because the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine via phenylalanine hydroxylase is the first step in the production of dopamine and is upregulated in response to low dopamine levels.

Option A is incorrect because dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency leads to a different set of symptoms including ptosis, hypoglycemia, and hypotension.

Option B is incorrect because phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase is involved in the synthesis of epinephrine from norepinephrine, not dopamine or serotonin.

Option C is incorrect because phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency leads to phenylketonuria, which presents with intellectual disability, seizures, fair skin, eczema, and musty body odor.

Option E is incorrect because dihydropteridine reductase deficiency leads to hyperphenylalaninemia and decreased synthesis of neurotransmitters but would have been detected on newborn screening.

This is a rare inherited disorder characterized by the deficiency of AADC enzyme, which is required for the synthesis of neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin. Key findings include hypotonia, poor suckling, oculogyric crises, and symptoms of autonomic dysfunction including vomiting and temperature instability.

In the pathway of dopamine synthesis, phenylalanine is converted to tyrosine by phenylalanine hydroxylase. Then, tyrosine is converted to Levodopa (L-DOPA) by Tyrosine hydroxylase. Finally, L-Dopa is converted into dopamine by Dopamine (or Aromatic L-Amino Acid) Decarboxylase. In the absence of this enzyme, dopamine is not produced, leading to the symptoms seen in this patient. The high phenylalanine levels seen in this patient occur due to an unchanged precursor.

Option A, dopamine hydroxylase, is incorrect because this enzyme is responsible for the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine, and its deficiency does not lead to an increase in phenylalanine. 

Option B, Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, is involved in the conversion of norepinephrine to epinephrine; its deficiency would not lead to the symptoms seen in this patient.

Option C, phenylalanine hydroxylase, when deficient, leads to phenylketonuria, which presents with intellectual disability, seizures, light skin and hair, but not the symptoms seen in the patient.

2104,"This patient's clinical picture is consistent with Potter sequence (or syndrome), which is associated with oligohydramnios secondary to bilateral renal agenesis or severe obstructive uropathy in utero. The sequence is a consequence of oligohydramnios, which leads to compression of the fetus against the uterine wall, resulting in characteristic facial features (flat face with low-set ears), pulmonary hypoplasia, and limb deformities. The oligohydramnios also results in failure of the lungs to develop properly, which is responsible for the newborn's respiratory distress and cyanosis. Renal ultrasound findings of bilateral hydronephrosis suggest severe urinary tract obstruction as the underlying cause of oligohydramnios.

Option 'A', Voiding cystourethrogram, is used to diagnose vesicoureteral reflux or posterior urethral valves, but the presence of bilateral hydronephrosis in this case is sufficient to diagnose urinary tract obstruction in utero.

Option 'B', Echocardiography, would be helpful in a newborn with signs of congenital heart disease, which this patient does not have.

5178,"The patient's anemia, pallor, and increased reticulocyte index suggest a diagnosis of anemia with increased red cell turnover. Given her African-American ethnicity and parents' Liberian origin, she likely has sickle cell anemia, a disease characterized by hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusive crises, and increased susceptibility to encapsulated bacteria (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae). Hemolytic anemia is suggested by the combination of anemia, increased reticulocyte index (indicative of increased red cell production), and jaundice. The likely cause of her anemia is not nutritional deficiency but rather, intrinsic red blood cell (RBC) defect leading to hemolysis. Therefore, she does not need vitamin B6 (pyridoxine, used in isoniazid-induced peripheral neuropathy), vitamin B9 (folic acid, used in megaloblastic anemia), vitamin B12 (cobalamin, used in pernicious anemia), or vitamin D (used in rickets/osteomalacia).

However, the patient's body is trying to compensate for the anemia by increasing RBC production in the bone marrow, which can deplete the body's iron stores over time.

This is the second most common cause of anemia after anemia due to iron deficiency. It is seen in individuals with chronic illnesses such as infection, inflammatory conditions (e.g., autoimmune diseases), malignancy, and, as in this patient, sickle cell disease. Anemia of inflammation is generally normocytic, but can be microcytic if iron deficiency anemia coexists. The inflammatory state leads to increased hepcidin production, which downregulates iron transport and leads to sequestration of iron within storage sites, making it unavailable for erythropoiesis. This gives the clinical picture of iron deficiency anemia (e.g., low serum iron, low total iron-binding capacity saturation, high total iron-binding capacity), but with normal to increased ferritin levels. Therefore, treatment involves addressing the underlying disease and administering supplemental iron (Choice E).

8959,"The symptoms described in this scenario are compatible with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is a multi-system autoimmune disease with a broad range of clinical presentations. Common symptoms include fatigue, musculoskeletal complaints (such as arthralgias, arthritis), and cutaneous manifestations. In particular, photosensitivity (as described by the patient's skin being ""very sensitive to sunlight"") and malar rash (which could be the reason the patient appears 'tanned') are classic cutaneous manifestations of SLE. Arthritis in SLE often involves the small joints of the hands and is usually non-erosive and non-deforming, though it can cause significant discomfort and reduction in range of motion. 

This makes 'A: Testing for anti-nuclear antibodies' the most appropriate next step in diagnosis. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) are seen in nearly all patients with SLE and are usually the first step in the diagnostic evaluation.

SLE is an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organ systems, including the skin, joints, kidneys, cardiovascular system, and nervous system. The photosensitivity is due to an inflammatory reaction that occurs in response to ultraviolet light exposure, which can cause a malar rash and also a generalized increase in skin pigmentation. Joint involvement (eg, fatigue, arthralgias, arthritis) occurs in most patients at some point in the course of their disease. Thus, the most appropriate next step is testing for anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), which is highly sensitive for SLE. A positive test should be followed by more specific tests for SLE (eg, anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-Smith antibodies).

750,"This patient's recurrent infections, facial eczema, and elevated serum IgE are suggestive of hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES), also known as Job syndrome. This is a rare primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by elevated serum IgE levels, eczema, and recurrent skin and lung infections. Patients with HIES typically have a mutation in the STAT3 gene which is involved in many cellular processes, including the Th17 cell mediated immune response, which is important for defense against extracellular pathogens. Impaired Th17 function is thought to contribute to the recurrent staphylococcal and Candida infections seen in these patients.

The most common clinical manifestations include ""coarse"" facial features, retained primary teeth, and recurrent skin abscesses, often with Staphylococcus aureus, with a lack of pus despite infection. Pneumonias, often due to S. aureus or Haemophilus influenzae, are also common, and can result in pneumatocele formation.

The earliest morphologic change seen in diabetic nephropathy is glomerular hypertrophy, which can occur before clinical disease becomes apparent. As diabetic nephropathy progresses, there is thickening of the glomerular basement membrane and mesangial expansion. Over time, these changes become widespread and nodular glomerulosclerosis (ie, Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules) develops.

Meniere disease is a disorder of the inner ear characterized by episodic vertigo, tinnitus, and sensorineural hearing loss. It is thought to be due to endolymphatic hydrops, or an excessive amount of fluid in the inner ear. The vertigo associated with Meniere disease is often severe and incapacitating, lasting for hours. Patients with Meniere disease can also experience aural fullness (sensation of ear pressure or fullness) and fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, which can eventually become permanent if left untreated.

These sickle cells are less flexible and are prone to causing microvascular occlusions, leading to recurrent painful episodes and eventual organ damage due to ischemia. On a peripheral blood smear, sickle cells may be seen, but they are often not prominent because they are rapidly removed from the circulation. Instead, other findings such as target cells and howell-jolly bodies (nuclear remnants) are more typically seen (Option C). 

Let's discuss why the other options are incorrect:

Option A: Ring-shaped inclusions in erythrocytes are seen in malaria, but this patient's symptoms are not consistent with this disease.

Option B: Teardrop-shaped erythrocytes are seen in conditions that cause bone marrow fibrosis, such as myelofibrosis.

Option D: Fragmentation of erythrocytes, or schistocytes, are seen in hemolytic anemia caused by mechanical destruction, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

This patient's painful episodes and chronic hemolytic anemia suggest a diagnosis of sickle cell disease (SCD), which is common in individuals of sub-Saharan African descent. SCD is caused by a mutation in the ß-globin chain that promotes polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin S into long, insoluble chains that deform the erythrocyte into a sickle shape. Sickling is precipitated by hypoxia, acidosis, and dehydration, and leads to microvascular occlusion and tissue infarction, causing severe pain in the affected area (eg, dactylitis [swelling of the hands and feet] in infants, acute chest syndrome, abdominal pain, priapism). On peripheral smear, these cells appear as sickle-shaped (or ""boat"" shaped) and are often described as having undergone ""fragmentation.""

5191,"The correct answer is 'A': Glucocorticoid receptor.

The hormone being described in the question is melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). MSH is produced by the anterior and intermediate lobe of the pituitary gland and acts on neural crest-derived cells (melanocytes) to stimulate pigment production. MSH is derived from the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) precursor molecule, which is also the precursor for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH acts on the glucocorticoid receptor, stimulating the adrenal cortex to secrete cortisol. Therefore, MSH and ACTH are often co-secreted, making 'A': Glucocorticoid receptor the correct answer.

As for why the other options are incorrect:

'B': Vasopressin receptor - Vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) is produced in the hypothalamus and stored in the posterior pituitary gland. It doesn't have a shared precursor with MSH and isn't co-secreted with it.

This is a life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus that often occurs in type 2 diabetics. It is characterized by severe hyperglycemia (>600 mg/dL), hyperosmolarity, and dehydration. Unlike diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), HHS does not have significant ketoacidosis. 

Treatment of HHS involves aggressive fluid resuscitation with normal saline to correct dehydration, insulin to reduce blood glucose levels, and replacement of electrolyte deficiencies, particularly potassium. Potassium levels often decrease with insulin treatment as insulin drives potassium into cells, which can precipitate hypokalemia. Therefore, even if the patient's potassium level is initially normal or high, potassium replacement is usually needed once insulin treatment is started and the potassium level starts to decrease.

This patient's initial potassium level is low (3.0 mEq/L, normal range 3.5-5.0 mEq/L), which makes him more susceptible to developing severe hypokalemia once insulin treatment is started. Therefore, the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient is insulin, normal saline, and potassium (Option D). 

Option A (insulin) is incorrect because while insulin is needed to reduce blood glucose levels, it is not the only treatment needed. Fluid resuscitation with normal saline is also needed to correct dehydration, and potassium replacement is needed to prevent hypokalemia.

Option B (insulin and normal saline) is incorrect because it does not include potassium replacement. As explained above, this patient is at high risk of developing severe hypokalemia once insulin treatment is started.

Option C (insulin and potassium) is incorrect because it does not include fluid resuscitation with normal saline. This patient is likely dehydrated due to hyperglycemia, which can cause osmotic diuresis.

Symptoms are often nonspecific but can include polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, weakness, and visual disturbances. Neurologic symptoms can occur with severe hyperosmolality and may include seizures, hemiparesis, and coma. This patient's dry mucous membranes suggest that he is dehydrated, which is common in HHS because of osmotic diuresis.
Initial treatment of HHS consists of IV fluids, insulin, and electrolyte replacement. Normal saline is used first to expand the intravascular volume, followed by insulin to decrease serum glucose. Given that this patient's potassium is low, he should also receive potassium supplementation with fluids and insulin to prevent further decrease in serum potassium level that will occur once insulin therapy is started (due to the intracellular shift of potassium).

This patient's presentation of abdominal pain with vomiting, inability to pass flatus, constipation, and findings of abdominal distention, tympany on percussion, and dilated loops of small bowel with collapsed large bowel distal to the dilation are suggestive of a small bowel obstruction (SBO). The most common cause of SBO in developed countries is adhesions (choice D) from previous surgery, which this patient likely has given his history of pneumonia, which could have required a surgical intervention. Adhesions cause obstruction by either directly constricting the lumen of the bowel or by pulling on the bowel and creating a closed loop obstruction.

Incarcerated hernia (choice A) is a less common cause of SBO and would likely present with a palpable abdominal wall mass and localized pain.
Mass effect from a tumor (choice B) is an uncommon cause of SBO but could present with a similar clinical picture. However, the transition point (ie, the point where the bowel calibre changes) on CT scan would likely be smooth, and there would be signs of a mass. Neither of these findings is present here.

The patient's presentation of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, inability to pass flatus, and visible abdominal distention is consistent with a small bowel obstruction (SBO). A history of gradually worsening abdominal pain that was initially postprandial and later became constant, along with a lack of flatus and bowel movements for 4 days, supports this diagnosis. The CT findings of dilated loops of small bowel with collapsed large bowel further confirm the diagnosis of an SBO.

The most common cause of SBO in developed countries is postoperative adhesions, which account for approximately 75% of all cases. Although the patient's history does not mention prior abdominal surgery, it is still the most likely cause given the epidemiology.

244,"The correct answer is C: Antibiotic therapy.

This patient's lethargy, high fever, and signs of meningeal irritation (severe headache, photophobia, nuchal rigidity, positive Kernig's and Brudzinski's signs) are concerning for bacterial meningitis. She also has decreased motor strength in the right upper extremity, suggestive of a focal neurologic deficit, possibly due to a meningeal or parenchymal brain lesion (eg, brain abscess, infarct, tumor). Importantly, because she has acute lymphoblastic leukemia and is post-chemotherapy, she is immunocompromised and at increased risk for both common and opportunistic infections (eg, Listeria monocytogenes, fungal species). 

In bacterial meningitis, empiric treatment should be started immediately after blood cultures have been obtained, without waiting for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis or imaging studies. Delaying antibiotics in patients with bacterial meningitis increases mortality. In adults and immunocompromised patients of all ages, treatment should include vancomycin plus ceftriaxone or cefotaxime. If Listeria infection is suspected (as in this immunocompromised patient), ampicillin should be added. If a focal neurologic abnormality is present, as in this patient, or if papilledema or altered consciousness is noted, computed tomography of the head should be performed before lumbar puncture to rule out a space-occupying lesion and prevent brain herniation.

The other options are incorrect because immediate antibiotic therapy is crucial in suspected bacterial meningitis. Although imaging studies (CT, MRI) and lumbar puncture are part of the workup, these can be deferred until after antibiotics are administered.

While lumbar puncture is commonly used to diagnose meningitis, it is contraindicated in cases showing signs of increased intracranial pressure or focal neurologic signs, such as the decreased muscle strength in the right upper extremity in this case, since it can cause brain herniation.

627,"This patient's symptoms of reproducible chest pain triggered by exertion and relieved by rest are consistent with stable angina. Stable angina is usually caused by atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, which results in a fixed obstruction (>70% stenosis). During periods of increased oxygen demand (eg, exertion), the narrowed vessels are unable to deliver an adequate supply of oxygenated blood to the myocardium, leading to ischemia and chest pain. Nitroglycerin, a nitrate, is often used to treat episodes of acute chest pain in patients with stable angina. It works primarily by relaxing vascular smooth muscle and causing systemic venodilation. The resulting decrease in venous return (preload) diminishes left ventricular end-diastolic volume and pressure, which reduces myocardial oxygen demand and can alleviate symptoms of ischemia. Nitroglycerin also causes coronary artery vasodilation, but this is a secondary effect and not the main mechanism of action in stable angina. Therefore, the answer is 'C: Coronary arterial vasodilation'.

Option A: 'Delayed electrical conduction' is incorrect because nitrates don't affect the cardiac conduction system.

Option B: 'Decreased venous pooling' is incorrect because while nitrates do cause venodilation, the main benefit in angina is from decreased preload and subsequent reduction in myocardial oxygen demand, not from effects on the venous system.

Option D: 'Increased atherosclerotic plaque stability' is incorrect because nitrates don't have any known effects on plaque stability.

Option E: 'Decreased end-diastolic pressure' is incorrect because this is an effect of decreased preload, not a direct effect of nitrates on the heart. Decreased preload from nitrate use can lead to decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume, but this is a result of systemic venodilation rather than a direct cardiac effect.","stop","therefore, the answer is 'c: coronary arterial vasodilation'.","C","E","USMLE question: A 65-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of chest pain that begins after walking at a brisk pace for 2 blocks.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's chest pain with exertion that is relieved with rest and nitroglycerin is consistent with stable angina, which is due to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen demand and supply. Stable angina is most commonly caused by atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, in which narrowing of the coronary arteries prevents adequate blood flow to meet increased myocardial oxygen demand during exertion. Nitroglycerin alleviates this myocardial ischemia and the associated chest pain by causing 'Coronary arterial vasodilation' (Option C) and reducing myocardial oxygen demand through systemic venodilation (which decreases preload).

'Delayed electrical conduction' (Option A) is not a mechanism of action of nitroglycerin. Antiarrhythmic drugs can delay electrical conduction and may be used in conditions such as atrial fibrillation or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, which are not present in this patient.

'Decreased venous pooling' (Option B) can decrease preload and myocardial oxygen demand but is not a primary mechanism of nitroglycerin. Physical maneuvers (eg, leg raising, squatting) and drugs that cause venous constriction can decrease venous pooling.

'Increased atherosclerotic plaque stability' (Option D) can reduce the risk of acute coronary syndrome but is not a mechanism of nitroglycerin. Statins have been shown to increase plaque stability.

'Decreased end-diastolic pressure' (Option E) can decrease myocardial wall stress and thus oxygen demand. However, nitroglycerin primarily decreases preload and afterload through systemic venodilation and does not directly decrease end-diastolic pressure.

Therefore, out of all the options, 'Coronary arterial vasodilation' (Option C) is the most likely explanation for the improvement of this patient's chest pain."
523,"The correct answer is E. Systemic hypotension.

The key in this question is the fact that the patient has just undergone surgery and has bilateral occipital lobe infarcts. The occipital lobes are supplied by the posterior cerebral arteries, which in turn arise from the vertebrobasilar system. The vertebrobasilar system is considered a 'watershed' or 'border zone' area in the brain, meaning it is especially vulnerable to ischemia during systemic hypotension, as it is the area furthest from the major blood supplying arteries. 

Systemic hypotension could occur during surgery due to factors such as blood loss, anesthesia, or cardiac dysfunction. The resulting decrease in perfusion pressure can lead to decreased blood flow to the brain's watershed areas, causing ischemia and infarction. This would present as cortical blindness (from the occipital lobe infarcts) and paralysis (from infarcts in the watershed areas between the anterior and middle cerebral arteries).

Now let's analyze other options:

Option A (Amyloid angiopathy) usually causes lobar hemorrhages in elderly patients, not infarcts.

Option B (Lipohyalinosis) results in small vessel (lacunar) strokes, typically in the deep structures of the brain (e.g., basal ganglia, internal capsule), not the cortical strokes seen in this patient.

Option C (Cardiac embolism) typically would not cause bilateral infarcts in the same distribution as seen in this patient. Emboli tend to travel to the brain and lodge in a single (and often large) vessel, causing a unilateral stroke. 

Option D (Atherothrombosis) tends to cause stroke in a single vascular territory, not bilateral occipital lobes.

Which of the following is the most likely etiology for this patient's hearing loss?
Option: {'A': 'Medication regimen', 'B': 'Otitis externa', 'C': 'Otitis media', 'D': 'Otosclerosis', 'E': 'Presbycusis'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The most likely etiology for this patient's hearing loss is E - Presbycusis. Presbycusis, or age-related hearing loss, is the most common cause of hearing loss in the elderly, and it presents as symmetric, bilateral, sensorineural hearing loss. It is often associated with difficulty hearing in noisy environments and trouble understanding high-pitched voices. The Weber test does not lateralize in sensorineural hearing loss, and the Rinne test demonstrates air conduction to be greater than bone conduction (as it should be in normal hearing). Both of these findings are present in this patient, which supports the diagnosis of presbycusis.

Option A - Medication regimen: Some medications can cause ototoxicity, leading to hearing loss. However, there is no information given about the patient's current medications. Furthermore, medication-induced hearing loss would typically affect one ear before the other, and this patient has symmetric hearing loss in both ears.

Option B - Otitis externa: This condition, also known as swimmer's ear, would present with symptoms like ear pain, itching or drainage, which this patient does not have.

Option C - Otitis media: Otitis media can cause hearing loss, but it typically presents with symptoms such as ear pain, fever, and feeling of fullness in the ear. This patient does not have these symptoms.

Option D - Otosclerosis: Otosclerosis is a condition that causes conductive hearing loss due to abnormal bone growth in the middle ear. However, the Rinne test in this case, showing that air conduction is greater than bone conduction, suggests sensorineural rather than conductive hearing loss."

6473,"This patient's submandibular mass and draining sinus tract are suggestive of actinomycosis, a chronic suppurative disease often caused by Actinomyces israelii, a filamentous, gram-positive anaerobe. Actinomyces is a normal commensal of the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and female genital tract and typically causes disease when there is a break in the mucosal barrier. For instance, dental procedures (eg, extraction, as in this patient) or trauma can lead to cervicofacial actinomycosis, the most common form of the disease. Clinical features include a slowly progressive, hard (""woody""), painless swelling with multiple draining sinus tracts. The tracts may extrude yellow sulfur granules, which are colonies of the organism. 

Actinomyces species are highly susceptible to penicillin. Therefore, high-dose intravenous penicillin G is the treatment of choice for severe disease. After clinical improvement, therapy can be changed to oral penicillin or amoxicillin to complete a total of 6-12 months of therapy.

This patient developed a rash following amoxicillin administration, which is suggestive of a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction (ie, delayed-type hypersensitivity). Patients with a delayed rash to amoxicillin can receive other beta-lactam antibiotics because cross-reactivity is rare. Therefore, this patient's treatment should be started with penicillin (Choice D). 

Surgical resection (Choice A) is not the first-line treatment for actinomycosis. It may be necessary in some cases if there's no response to medical treatment or to manage complications (eg, abscess, fistula).

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The patient's presentation of a slowly progressive, painless, draining mass in the mandibular area, along with gram-positive filamentous rods on Gram stain, is consistent with actinomycosis. Actinomycosis is an indolent infection caused by Actinomyces species, which are normal flora of the oropharynx, gastrointestinal tract, and female genital tract. The most common form of disease, cervicofacial actinomycosis, often occurs after dental procedures, oral surgery, or oral trauma. Patients usually present with a ""lumpy jaw"" due to the formation of multiple abscesses and draining sinus tracts. Actinomyces are gram positive, but because they form filamentous branches, they can resemble fungi. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating sulfur granules, which are hard, yellow colonies of Actinomyces, on histopathologic examination. The treatment of actinomycosis includes surgical drainage and long-term, high-dose penicillin therapy. This patient has a history of amoxicillin-induced rash, which does not preclude the use of penicillin in the future. Minor skin reactions (eg, maculopapular rash) to amoxicillin, especially when it is given for Epstein-Barr virus infection (as in this patient, who likely had infectious mononucleosis with streptococcal pharyngitis), do not increase the risk for serious reactions (eg, anaphylaxis) with future penicillin use. Therefore, the answer is Penicillin V (Option D).

A (Surgical resection of the mass): This is an incorrect answer because while surgical drainage is needed, long-term antibiotic therapy is also necessary. 

B (Doxycycline), C (Trimethoprim-sulfamethaxazole), E (Cephalexin): These antibiotics are not the first-line treatment for actinomycosis."

This patient's symptoms of fatigue, pallor, purpura, and splenomegaly in the setting of a peripheral smear showing hypersegmented neutrophils and macro-ovalocytes (indirect markers of ineffective hematopoiesis) are suggestive of a diagnosis of Pernicious Anemia, a type of Vitamin B12 deficiency. This is often due to the autoimmune destruction of gastric parietal cells leading to a lack of intrinsic factor, which is necessary for Vitamin B12 absorption in the ileum. Pancytopenia, with decreased platelets (Option A), may be seen due to the infiltration of the bone marrow with megaloblasts. The PT and PTT are typically normal (Option B) as the vitamin K dependent factors (II, VII, IX, X) are not affected. An elevated reticulocyte count (Option D) is expected in response to anemia, but may not be elevated enough to overcome the anemia (ineffective erythropoiesis). Finally, elevated bilirubin (Option E) can be seen due to ineffective erythropoiesis, which increases the proportion of erythrocyte precursors undergoing apoptosis within the bone marrow, leading to increased bilirubin. There is no particular reason to expect renal dysfunction (elevated creatinine, Option C) in this setting.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's fever, fatigue, splenomegaly, and pancytopenia (evidenced by inability to move her right arm or leg due to a stroke, nonpalpable purpura indicating thrombocytopenia, and pallor indicating anemia) suggest a diagnosis of acute leukemia, most likely acute myeloid leukemia given her age. Acute leukemia is a clonal proliferation of myeloid or lymphoid precursors (blasts) in the bone marrow. The blasts crowd out normal hematopoietic cells, leading to anemia (fatigue, pallor), thrombocytopenia (bleeding, purpura), and neutropenia (infections). Normocytic, normochromic anemia with an elevated reticulocyte count (choice D) would not be expected because acute leukemia results in a decreased production of all cell lines, including red blood cells, leading to a low reticulocyte count. The anemia of leukemia is typically normocytic and normochromic with a low reticulocyte count, reflecting an underproduction of red blood cells.

As for the other options:
Decreased platelets (choice A) are expected because of bone marrow infiltration by blasts.
Normal PTT and PT (choice B) are expected because the coagulation factors (which are synthesized in the liver) are typically not affected by leukemia.
Elevated creatinine (choice C) may be seen due to tumor lysis syndrome, a complication of chemotherapy that results in hyperuricemia and acute kidney injury.

5686,"This patient's presentation of fever, cough with rust-colored sputum, and unilateral inspiratory crackles on lung examination is suggestive of pneumonia, most likely due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (option B). Streptococcus pneumoniae, also known as pneumococcus, is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia. Pneumococcal pneumonia often presents with an abrupt onset of fever, chills, pleuritic chest pain, and productive cough. The cough usually produces rust-colored sputum due to the presence of blood. Physical examination typically reveals unilateral findings (eg, localized crackles). Patients with multiple sclerosis have an increased risk of pneumonia due to impaired swallowing, which can lead to aspiration, and weakened respiratory muscles.

Option A (Pericarditis) would present with sharp, pleuritic chest pain that improves with sitting up and leaning forward, often accompanied by a pericardial friction rub on examination. There would not typically be fever or cough unless it is part of a viral syndrome.
Option C (Pulmonary embolism) would often present with acute-onset dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and/or tachycardia in a patient with risk factors for deep venous thrombosis (eg, immobilization, recent surgery).

5579,"The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient would be 'D: Administer Td only'. This is due to the high risk for tetanus in puncture wounds, especially those caused by a rusty nail. Tetanus is a life-threatening but preventable disease caused by the neurotoxin of Clostridium tetani. The spores of C. tetani are found in soil and can contaminate wounds, especially deep, necrotic wounds like puncture wounds, which provide an anaerobic environment for the spores to germinate. 

The vaccination schedule for tetanus in children includes a series of five doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine at ages 2, 4, 6, 15-18 months, and 4-6 years. Boosters of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) are then given every 10 years. As this patient is 15 years old and had his last shot before starting middle school at age 12, we can assume that he has completed the primary series and had at least one booster dose. 

However, because tetanus is such a severe disease and because puncture wounds are particularly prone to tetanus, even fully immunized patients should receive a tetanus booster (Td) if their last dose was more than 5 years ago and they have a high-risk wound, such as a puncture wound. 

The other options are not appropriate. Cleaning and dressing the wound only (Option A) does not provide adequate protection against tetanus. Administering DT (Option B) is not appropriate because this vaccine does not contain the pertussis component, which is not needed in this case. Administering Tdap, Td, and TIG (Option C) would be an overtreatment because TIG is only indicated in unvaccinated individuals or those with uncertain vaccination status. Finally, administering Td and TIG (Option E) would also be excessive for the same reasons.","stop","the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient would be 'd: administer td only'.","D","E","USMLE question: A 15-year-old boy presents to the emergency department after a rusty nail pierced through his right foot.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The most appropriate next step in management is to administer Tdap (Option C).

The patient's wound is at high risk for tetanus due to the contaminated puncture wound (rusty nail) and the possible absence of booster vaccination. Tetanus is a serious infection caused by Clostridium tetani, and wounds that are puncture-type, contaminated with dirt/feces, or resulting from a crush injury are particularly susceptible.

In the US, the standard childhood immunizations include a primary series of tetanus toxoid (contained in the DTaP vaccine) administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months and boosters at 4-6 years and 11-12 years. This patient's last shot was before starting middle school (around age 11-12 years), so this may have been the booster dose. However, since it's not exactly clear, the safest decision would be to provide a booster for tetanus. 

Tdap is preferred over Td for individuals 11-64 years old who have not previously received Tdap. Tdap includes protection against pertussis (whooping cough), which is beneficial since teenagers and adults are often the source of pertussis infection in infants. Tetanus immune globulin (TIG) is not needed in this case because it's used for individuals who are not immunized or incompletely immunized.

Option A is wrong because simply cleaning the wound is not enough for a high-risk injury. Options B, D, and E are also incorrect because Tdap is preferred over DT or Td for this age group, and TIG is not needed."
2078,"The patient's bleeding symptoms and failure to agglutinate in response to ristocetin suggest a diagnosis of Bernard-Soulier syndrome. Bernard-Soulier syndrome is a bleeding disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and large platelets. The disease is caused by a defect in the platelet glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex, which is responsible for binding to von Willebrand factor and initiating platelet plug formation. The ristocetin coagglutination test measures the ability of platelets to agglutinate in the presence of von Willebrand factor and the antibiotic ristocetin. In patients with Bernard-Soulier syndrome, this test is negative because the platelets cannot bind to von Willebrand factor.

It's characterized by the episodic gross hematuria that usually occurs concurrently with or within a few days of a nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection. This occurs because the mucosal immune response to the infection leads to an increase in IgA production. Abnormal IgA (particularly polymeric IgA1) is produced, and it circulates in complexes that are deposited in the renal mesangium, leading to inflammation and hematuria. With each episode of macroscopic hematuria, the urine is pink or cola-colored and may contain red blood cell casts. Many patients also have microscopic hematuria and proteinuria between episodes.

This patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and obesity, all risk factors for heart failure. His symptoms of frequent urination (polyuria) and physical examination findings of visible jugular pulsations (jugular venous distension) suggest the presence of heart failure. His irregular pulse also suggests atrial fibrillation, another common comorbidity of heart failure.

Furosemide is a loop diuretic that is commonly used in the management of heart failure to relieve symptoms of volume overload. However, it can also cause polyuria and electrolyte imbalances, as well as worsen kidney function. In this patient with diabetes mellitus, who is at risk for diabetic nephropathy, the use of furosemide could be exacerbating his polyuria and potentially worsening his kidney function, as suggested by his mildly elevated serum creatinine level.

Current medications are metformin, aspirin, rosuvastatin, captopril, and furosemide. His vital signs are an irregular pulse of 74/min, a respiratory rate of 14/min, a blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg, and a temperature of 36.7Â°C (98.0Â°F). His BMI is 32 kg/m2. On physical examination, there are visible jugular pulsations present in the neck bilaterally. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:
Glycated Hemoglobin (Hb A1c) 7.5%
 Fasting Blood Glucose 120 mg/dL

Option: {'A': 'Stop metformin.', 'B': 'Replace captopril with valsartan.', 'C': 'Start rosiglitazone.', 'D': 'Stop furosemide.', 'E': 'Start exenatide.'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's frequent urination, chronic mild cough, and visible jugular pulsations (indicative of jugular venous distension) suggest the diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF). In CHF, impaired cardiac output leads to renal hypoperfusion and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Persistent RAAS activation results in sodium and fluid retention and stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. These compensatory responses increase preload and afterload and contribute to further myocardial injury. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including captopril, have been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure and are a first-line treatment in such patients. However, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) like valsartan can be used in patients who are intolerant to ACE inhibitors due to cough (Choice B). ACE inhibitors can cause cough by promoting the accumulation of bradykinin, which can stimulate afferent nerve endings in the cough reflex pathway.

Stopping metformin (Choice A) would not be necessary unless the patient had a contraindication to its use, such as kidney failure or metabolic acidosis. Rosiglitazone (Choice C) is an anti-diabetic medication and is not specifically used for the treatment of heart failure. In fact, it is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction and heart failure. Stopping furosemide (Choice D) would exacerbate fluid overload, worsening heart failure symptoms. Exenatide (Choice E) is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist used for management of type 2 diabetes, not for CHF. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
5817,"The patient's symptoms of fever, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea with polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the stool suggest an invasive diarrheal illness, most likely due to bacteria such as Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, or enteroinvasive Escherichia coli. These symptoms typically begin 1-3 days after ingestion of contaminated food, which is consistent with the patient's history of visiting an international food festival three days ago. Therefore, the patient most likely consumed food that was contaminated with one of these bacteria.

The sources of the bacteria include:

- Salmonella: Poultry, eggs, dairy products, and contaminated produce
- Shigella: Contaminated food, water, or surfaces; person-to-person transmission
- Campylobacter: Poultry, unpasteurized milk, and contaminated water
- Enteroinvasive E. coli: Contaminated food and water

Considering the available options, the most likely source of bacterial contamination would be the omelette (Option E). Eggs and poultry (common ingredients in an omelette) are known potential sources of Salmonella.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

- Reheated rice (Option A) can cause food poisoning due to Bacillus cereus, which produces an emetic toxin that causes nausea and vomiting within 1-5 hours of ingestion, or a diarrheal toxin that causes watery diarrhea and abdominal cramps within 8-16 hours of ingestion. Neither form is associated with fever or bloody diarrhea.
- Yogurt dip (Option B) can be contaminated with bacteria, but it is typically pasteurized, which kills most harmful bacteria. Additionally, yogurt contains beneficial bacteria that can inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria.
- Toxic mushrooms (Option C) can cause various symptoms depending on the type of mushroom, but these typically include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and hallucinations. They do not typically cause fever or bloody diarrhea.
- Home-canned vegetables (Option D) can cause botulism if they are improperly canned. This is characterized by a flaccid paralysis rather than a diarrheal illness.","stop","","E","E","USMLE question: A 32-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with a 2-day history of abdominal pain and diarrhea.

Both of these bacteria invade the intestinal mucosa, causing fever, abdominal pain, and inflammatory diarrhea characterized by the presence of leukocytes and blood in the stool. Among the choices provided, Shigella and Salmonella are most commonly associated with 'Home-canned vegetables' (Option D) due to improper canning and storage procedures.

Option A, 'Reheated rice', is typically associated with Bacillus cereus, which causes two types of gastrointestinal illness - an emetic type and a diarrheal type. Neither typically present with bloody diarrhea.

This patient's CT scan and biopsy results indicating malignancy, gland formation, and mucus production suggest a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the lung. The most common type of lung cancer in nonsmokers, adenocarcinoma, often arises from the mucous-producing glands in the periphery of the lung. This malignancy is also the most common type of lung cancer in women and individuals under 45 years old. Though the woman has never smoked, her history of peptic ulcer disease with positive H. pylori biopsy indicates a potential risk. It has been observed in studies that H. pylori, an organism capable of provoking a significant inflammatory response, may play a role in the development of extragastric malignancies, including lung cancer. 

Option A (Medication) is incorrect as there is no information in the patient's history suggesting any medication that might have predisposed her to lung cancer. 

Option B (Occupational history) is incorrect because teaching is not typically associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. Certain occupations, such as mining, construction, and shipbuilding, are potential risk factors due to the prevalence of asbestos in these occupations.

Option D (Race) is incorrect as there is no established link between being Caucasian and having an increased risk of adenocarcinoma of the lung.

Option E (Gender) is incorrect because even though adenocarcinoma is the most common type of lung cancer in women, being a woman is not considered a risk factor in developing lung cancer. Risk factors would include smoking, family history of lung cancer, and exposure to certain toxic substances."
1488,"The most likely diagnosis for this boy is osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a genetic condition characterized by increased fragility of bones leading to recurrent fractures with minimal or no trauma. It is caused by a mutation in the genes that produce type I collagen (COL1A1 and COL1A2), resulting in abnormal collagen production (Option A). In addition to multiple fractures, other clinical features may include blue sclera (due to thinning of the sclera, allowing the underlying choroidal veins to be visible), hearing loss, and dental abnormalities (dentinogenesis imperfecta).

Option B (Decreased collagen hydroxylation) is incorrect. Vitamin C deficiency leads to scurvy, which is characterized by impaired wound healing, ecchymoses, bleeding gums, and anemia due to decreased collagen hydroxylation, but not fractures.

Option C (Increased adenylyl cyclase activity) is incorrect. This is associated with McCune-Albright syndrome, which is characterized by polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, cafe-au-lait spots, and precocious puberty, but not increased bone fragility.

OI is primarily caused by mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes, which are responsible for the production of the protein collagen. Abnormal collagen production weakens the connective tissues, making the bones more fragile and prone to fractures.

8729,"The answer is A: Needle injury to ulnar nerve secondary to blind line placement.

The patient's symptoms of lack of sensation over the palmar and dorsal surface of the small finger and half of the ring finger, weak digit abduction, weak thumb adduction, and weak thumb-index finger pinch are consistent with ulnar nerve injury. The ulnar nerve provides sensory innervation to the medial (ulnar) 1.5 fingers and their associated palm area, as well as motor innervation to most of the intrinsic hand muscles (interossei, medial two lumbricals, adductor pollicis, hypothenar muscles). It can be injured anywhere along its course from the brachial plexus to the hand, but the elbow and wrist are most commonly affected. However, in this case, the axilla is the most likely location of injury secondary to the attempted placement of an axillary line.

Option B is wrong because a median nerve injury would present with symptoms affecting the lateral (radial) 3.5 fingers and their associated palm area.

Option C is wrong because the presentation is not consistent with a compression neuropathy. Compression of the ulnar nerve typically presents with clawing of the fourth and fifth digits, also known as ""ulnar claw,"" and would not be localized to the axilla.

Option D is wrong because the symptoms do not align with a median nerve injury.

5096,"The correct answer is E. Testicular doppler ultrasound. 

This patient's severe testicular pain, absence of the cremasteric reflex (normal reflex is testicle elevation with stroking of the inner thigh), and elevated testicle on examination are concerning for testicular torsion, a urologic emergency. Testicular torsion occurs when the spermatic cord twists, leading to compromised blood flow and potential loss of the testicle. The pain is often severe, sudden in onset, and associated with nausea and vomiting. On examination, the testicle is often high-riding with a transverse lie. The cremasteric reflex is typically absent. 

The most important step in evaluation of suspected testicular torsion is Doppler ultrasound (choice E) to assess testicular blood flow. However, if torsion is highly likely based on clinical presentation, immediate surgical exploration (choice D) without imaging is warranted as the testicle can become nonviable after 6 hours of torsion.

CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (choice A) would not be the best choice in this case, as this imaging modality does not provide as detailed an assessment of testicular blood flow as Doppler ultrasound. 

IV antibiotics (choice B) would be appropriate if epididymitis or orchitis were suspected, but this patient's presentation is more consistent with testicular torsion.

In a patient with a history of chronic ibuprofen use, a likely diagnosis is Riedel thyroiditis, a rare form of chronic inflammation that leads to a dense fibrosis that replaces normal thyroid tissue and extends into adjacent neck structures. This fibrotic process causes a ""woody"" hard, non-tender goiter that can compress the trachea, esophagus, and recurrent laryngeal nerves. Additionally, fibrosis can encase and constrict the carotid artery and jugular vein, leading to vascular compromise.

The patient is presenting with symptoms of a major depressive disorder. It is critical to initiate therapy to alleviate the patient's symptoms and reduce the risk of suicide. Bupropion should be avoided in this case due to the patient's history of erectile dysfunction. Bupropion has been associated with sexual side effects, such as erectile dysfunction, which could potentially worsen the patient's condition.

The other options mentioned are all used in the treatment of major depressive disorder:

A: Vortioxetine is an atypical antidepressant that is thought to improve mood by enhancing serotonin activity in the brain. It is considered a well-tolerated drug with a low side effect profile, making it a suitable treatment option for this patient.

B: Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that has been proven effective in treating major depressive disorder. Although it can cause sexual side effects, it is generally less likely to do so than Bupropion.

D: Mirtazapine is an atypical antidepressant that works by increasing the release of norepinephrine and serotonin in the brain. It is known for its sedative properties, which might be beneficial in this patient who struggles to sleep at night.

E: Vilazodone is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a partial agonist at the 5-HT1A receptor.

This patient?s history and symptoms are consistent with major depressive disorder (MDD), which is characterized by depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities along with at least four additional symptoms such as fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, diminished concentration, or insomnia for at least a 2-week period. First-line treatment options for MDD include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), mirtazapine, and bupropion. However, an important consideration in choosing an appropriate treatment regimen is the patient?s specific symptomatology, past medical history, and potential for adverse effects of the medications.

Bupropion, an atypical antidepressant, inhibits norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake. It is less likely to cause sexual side effects than SSRIs and SNRIs and can therefore be beneficial in patients who have experienced these side effects with other treatments. However, bupropion does carry a risk of causing or exacerbating anxiety and insomnia, which this patient is already experiencing, thus it should be avoided in this case.

Fluoxetine (option B) is a SSRI and first-line treatment for depression. Mirtazapine (option D), an atypical antidepressant, is also a first-line treatment and can be particularly helpful in patients with insomnia and lack of appetite. Vortioxetine (option A) and vilazodone (option E) are both atypical antidepressants and are also considered acceptable treatments for MDD. They are all less likely to exacerbate his anxiety or insomnia than bupropion."
8773,"The correct answer is E: 'Increased specificity and decreased positive predictive value'.

The physician is considering narrowing the definition of severe hyponatremia, which means that fewer patients will meet the criteria for this diagnosis. By doing so, he is increasing the specificity of the test. Specificity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those without the disease (true negative rate). So, if we raise the threshold for what constitutes severe hyponatremia, we will have fewer false positives (asymptomatic patients with a serum sodium < 120 mEq/L), thereby increasing the specificity.

However, by narrowing the criteria, we are also decreasing the positive predictive value. Positive predictive value (PPV) is the probability that subjects with a positive screening test truly have the disease. If we set the threshold for severe hyponatremia at < 115 mEq/L, we would have fewer true positives (those with severe hyponatremia who are correctly identified), but the number of false positives would also decrease. This results in a smaller proportion of true positives among all those who test positive (true positives + false positives), thus decreasing the PPV.

As for the other options, increasing the specificity would not alter the negative predictive value (Option A). Decreasing the specificity would lead to more false positives, not fewer (Option B). Changing the cutoff wouldn't impact the sensitivity, as it refers to the ability to identify true positives, not how they are defined (Option C). Finally, decreasing the sensitivity would suggest missing more true positives, which is not the case here (Option D).","stop","the correct answer is e: 'increased specificity and decreased positive predictive value'.","E","A","USMLE question: A physician at an internal medicine ward notices that several of his patients have hyponatremia without any associated symptoms.

Because some patients are chronically hyponatremic, with serum levels < 120 mEq/L, but remain asymptomatic, the physician is considering decreasing the cutoff for severe hyponatremia to < 115 mEq/L. Changing the cutoff to < 115 mEq/L would affect the validity of serum sodium in predicting severe hyponatremia requiring hypertonic saline in which of the following ways?

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","Decreasing the cutoff for severe hyponatremia to < 115 mEq/L would increase the specificity and decrease the positive predictive value (PPV). This means that:

- Specificity would increase because a cutoff point of < 115 mEq/L would make the test more specific to severe cases of hyponatremia that require treatment with hypertonic saline. This is because fewer patients with non-severe hyponatremia would be wrongly identified as requiring treatment (fewer false positives).

- Positive predictive value (PPV) would decrease because, while the test would be more specific, it would also be less likely to correctly identify patients who require treatment (more false negatives). In other words, among patients who test positive (serum sodium < 115 mEq/L), fewer would actually require treatment.

Option A is incorrect because increasing specificity would not affect the negative predictive value (NPV), which refers to the probability that patients with a negative test result (serum sodium = 115 mEq/L) truly do not need treatment.

Option B is incorrect because decreasing the cutoff would not decrease the specificity but increase it. Also, the negative predictive value would not be affected, as explained above.

Option C is incorrect because the change in cutoff would not increase sensitivity. In fact, it would decrease it, because it would be less able to identify patients who truly need treatment. The decrease in positive predictive value is correct.

Option D is incorrect because, while sensitivity would indeed decrease, the positive predictive value would also decrease, not stay the same.

5427,"The correct answer is 'E: HER-2/neu positive'. 

HER-2/neu positive breast cancers tend to be more aggressive and have a poorer prognosis than those that are HER-2/neu negative.

As for the other options:

'A: Axillary lymphadenopathy' - While axillary lymphadenopathy does suggest regional spread of the disease, it is not as strong a prognostic indicator as HER-2/neu status. 

'B: Increased age' - Age is not a major prognostic factor in breast cancer. While it is true that the incidence of breast cancer increases with age, the aggressiveness of the disease and prognosis are not directly related to age.

'C: ER positive' - Estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancers actually have a better prognosis than those that are ER negative. This is because ER positive cancers are usually less aggressive and respond well to hormonal therapies.

The mammography of the left breast shows a spiculated mass in the upper outer quadrant. An excisional biopsy of the mass is performed, and the histologic examination reveals the following significant findings (see image).

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is E: HER-2/neu positive.

HER-2/neu is a proto-oncogene that codes for a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, and it is amplified in approximately 20% of breast cancers. The HER-2/neu-positive subtype of breast cancer is associated with a more aggressive disease, higher recurrence rate, and decreased survival. Although therapies targeting HER-2/neu (eg, trastuzumab) have improved prognosis, HER-2/neu positivity remains an indicator of poor prognosis.

Option A: Axillary lymphadenopathy does indicate a higher stage of disease (which generally correlates with prognosis), but HER-2/neu positivity is a more important prognostic factor as it indicates a more aggressive disease subtype.

Option B: Increased age is a risk factor for developing breast cancer, but it does not significantly affect the prognosis once the disease has developed.

Option C: ER positivity is actually associated with a better prognosis in breast cancer. ER-positive tumors are less aggressive and can be managed with hormone therapy (eg, tamoxifen), which improves overall survival.

Option D: Inflammatory subtype is associated with a poor prognosis. However, the question stem does not provide any evidence of inflammatory breast cancer, which is characterized by red, swollen, warm, and often tender breast, often without a discrete palpable mass. 

So, even though options A and D could potentially indicate a poor prognosis, the question specifically identifies the tumor as being HER-2/neu-positive, which is a stronger indicator of poor prognosis."

106,"This patient's increased fatigue, generalized weakness, hyporeflexia, and ECG changes (flattened T waves and ST-segment depression) suggest a diagnosis of hypokalemia, which is commonly seen in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus who are treated with insulin. Increased insulin levels promote the movement of potassium from the extracellular space to the intracellular space by increasing the activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, thus lowering serum potassium levels. In response to hypokalemia, the kidneys try to conserve potassium. This is primarily accomplished in the principal cells of the collecting ducts, where potassium can be reabsorbed from the urine back into the cell via luminal potassium channels (option E).

Option A: The H+/K+ antiporter in Î±-intercalated cells is responsible for secreting K+ into urine, so its activity would be decreased rather than increased in response to hypokalemia.

9993,"The information given doesn't provide the ECG finding, which is important in making a decision. However, considering the clinical scenario, a common rhythm abnormality in this case could be atrial fibrillation or other atrial tachyarrhythmias, which are often seen in patients with pulmonary diseases. Without the ECG it is hard to choose the best option.

Here is a brief idea about the options given:

A: Metoprolol is a beta blocker, primarily used in managing hypertension, angina, heart failure, and to prevent further heart problems after a heart attack. It is used in rhythm disorders primarily to control the heart rate, especially in conditions like atrial fibrillation. This could be a possibility if the ECG indicated atrial fibrillation.

B: Magnesium sulfate is often used to correct hypomagnesemia, which can cause palpitations. However, the patient's magnesium level is normal.

C: Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic medication used to treat and prevent several types of irregular heartbeats such as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, and is also used in atrial fibrillation. Without the ECG it is difficult to determine if this is the best choice.

D: Overdrive pacing is used for certain tachyarrhythmias, such as supraventricular tachycardia or ventricular tachycardia, but is not generally the first-line treatment. Moreover, the patient's heart rate is not high.

E: Potassium chloride is used to treat or prevent hypokalemia (low potassium levels). But the patient's potassium level is normal.

Without the ECG finding, it's hard to make a definitive choice. Assuming atrial fibrillation or flutter is present on the ECG, given the patient's pulmonary infection, the best step might be rate control with metoprolol (Option A), or rhythm control with amiodarone (Option C), depending on the patient's overall clinical status. If the arrhythmia is caused by the lung infection, treating the infection is also essential.

1617,"The correct answer is 'A': Loss of taste from posterior 1/3 of tongue.

The facial nerve (7th cranial nerve) passes through the parotid gland but does not innervate it.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is A. Loss of taste from posterior 1/3 of tongue.

Explanation: The facial nerve (VII) is the cranial nerve that passes through the parotid gland. It has several branches with diverse functions including the chorda tympani which carries taste sensation from the anterior two thirds of the tongue and the nerve to the stapedius muscle in the ear. However, it's the Glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) which passes near the parotid gland and is responsible for taste sensation from the posterior 1/3 of the tongue.

5666,"The properties described are consistent with a protein functioning as an enzyme. The key clue is that the protein's activity increases linearly with substrate concentration without any saturation, suggesting that it is not limited by the availability of substrate. This property is typical of enzymes, which catalyze reactions by lowering the activation energy and are not consumed in the process. In contrast, transporters, channels, and receptors (including those involved in action potentials, neuronal-muscle communication, and ion maintenance) tend to become saturated as substrate concentration increases. In addition, enzymes can be activated by cofactors, which could explain the increase in activity with the addition of a small amount of an additional substance.

Hence, option 'D' 'Reabsorption of glucose in the proximal kidney tubule' seems the most plausible. This process is mediated by sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), an active transporter that couples the transport of glucose with the down-gradient movement of sodium ions, providing the driving force for glucose reabsorption without requiring ATP.

The other options are less likely because: 

Option 'A' 'Causing depolarization during action potentials' and 'B' 'Maintenance of resting sodium and potassium concentrations' involve ion channels that typically do not increase their activity linearly with substrate concentration without saturation.

The protein described seems to function as an ion channel, which allows ions to pass through the membrane down their concentration gradients without using ATP. The fact that the proteinâ??s activity increases linearly with substrate concentration without saturation suggests that it acts via facilitated diffusion, as active transport proteins would saturate at high substrate concentrations due to limited numbers of transport proteins. 

Furthermore, the fact that changing the electrical charge across the membrane does not affect the protein's activity lines up with the properties of ion channels, which are typically not voltage-gated. The fact that its activity can be increased by adding a small amount of an additional substance could be referring to a co-factor or a modulator.

Option A ('Causing depolarization during action potentials') is incorrect because voltage-gated channels, not passive channels, are involved in action potential propagation.

5476,"The correct answer is 'A': Adenosine monophosphate.

Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) is a signaling molecule which is able to stimulate reactions such as glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis to maintain blood glucose levels during fasting. AMP acts as a signal of energy depletion within the cell. When cellular energy levels are low (e.g., during fasting), the cell's ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) stores are broken down into ADP (Adenosine diphosphate) and further to AMP. This increase in AMP triggers the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an enzyme that regulates energy balance in the cell. AMPK stimulates catabolic pathways, such as glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, which increase the availability of glucose and thus replenishes ATP.

On the other hand, options 'B', 'D', and 'E' are incorrect because they are all molecules involved in the citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle or the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. While these molecules are crucial in energy metabolism, they do not directly stimulate glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis.

Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) is a key signaling molecule that stimulates glucose production by activating the process of gluconeogenesis when the body's glucose stores are depleted.

This triggers the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. AMPK, in turn, stimulates glucose production and fatty acid oxidation to produce more ATP.

The other options are incorrect. 

Option 'B': Acetate is a product of fatty acid oxidation but does not directly stimulate gluconeogenesis.

Option 'C': Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) is also a product of ATP degradation, but it does not directly stimulate gluconeogenesis. It is converted back into ATP to store energy for the cell.

In a mixing study, the patient's plasma is mixed with normal plasma. If the PTT corrects, as in this case, it is because the normal plasma contains all the necessary factors, indicating the patient has a factor deficiency.

Physical examination often reveals tenderness in the groin and decreased range of motion of the hip due to pain.

Options 'A' and 'E' refer to conditions such as slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) and Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, respectively. SCFE typically presents in adolescents who are overweight with chronic, dull hip or knee pain, and is not usually associated with a recent viral illness. Legg-Calve-Perthes disease commonly presents in boys aged 4-8 who have chronic hip pain, but it is often associated with additional symptoms such as limping for several months, decreased hip mobility, and thigh muscle wasting.

Option 'B', bacterial infection of the joint, also known as septic arthritis, is a serious condition that typically presents with acute onset of severe pain, inability to bear weight, fever, and elevated inflammatory markers. This boy's mild symptoms and normal vital signs make this diagnosis unlikely.

Option 'C', viral infection, is not the correct answer because although transient synovitis is often preceded by a viral infection, the underlying mechanism of the disease is immune-mediated inflammation, not active viral infection."

8473,"This patient's symptoms and physical findings are consistent with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the joints. RA is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis, morning stiffness that lasts for more than an hour, and specific involvement of the proximal interphalangeal joints. The presence of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies is highly specific for RA. The pathogenesis of RA involves both type II and III hypersensitivities, making answer B the correct choice.

Type II hypersensitivity in RA is represented by the formation of autoantibodies against IgG (rheumatoid factor) and citrullinated peptides (anti-CCP), leading to immune complex formation and complement activation. Type III hypersensitivity is involved when these immune complexes deposit in tissues, inciting an inflammatory response that leads to the clinical manifestations of RA.

Option A: Self-tolerance is a normal process by which the immune system does not attack the body's own cells. Loss of self-tolerance can lead to autoimmune diseases like RA, but it is not a type of immune-mediated injury.

Option C: IgE-mediated immune responses are type I hypersensitivity reactions, which are involved in allergic reactions. They are not typically involved in RA.

Option D: Type IV hypersensitivity reactions are T-cell mediated and are involved in diseases like tuberculosis and contact dermatitis, but not in RA.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's chronic symmetric polyarthritis (inflammation of many joints) with morning stiffness lasting more than an hour and the presence of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies is suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder that primarily involves the synovial joints. The pathogenesis of RA is a result of both type III and type IV hypersensitivity reactions. Thus, the answer is B: 'Both type II and III hypersensitivities'.

In the early stages of the disease, immune complexes (antigen-antibody) deposit on the synovial membrane leading to the activation of complement and recruitment of inflammatory cells, which is characteristic of type III hypersensitivity reactions. As the disease progresses, T cells (type IV hypersensitivity) become involved and are responsible for the ongoing chronic inflammation in the synovium.

Option A: 'Self-tolerance' is not correct because it is a normal process that prevents the immune system from attacking its own tissues. In autoimmune diseases like RA, self-tolerance is lost, but it's not an immune-mediated injury itself.

Option C: 'IgE-mediated immune responses only' is not correct because it represents type I hypersensitivity reactions, which are not implicated in the pathophysiology of RA.

Option D: 'Type IV hypersensitivity' is partially correct because it is involved in RA but not the only type of hypersensitivity reaction that contributes to the disease.

5322,"The correct answer is A: Routine screening: repeat Pap test every 3 years.

This patient's Pap smear shows atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US). ASC-US is the most common abnormal result on cervical cytology and is characterized by slightly irregular squamous cells that may be related to HPV infection but could also be due to other non-HPV factors such as inflammation or atrophy. The optimal management of ASC-US depends on the result of reflex HPV testing. If HPV test is positive, colposcopy is indicated because of the higher risk of CIN 2 or 3. If HPV test is negative (as in this patient), the risk of CIN 2 or 3 is very low, and patients should be managed with routine screening, that is, a repeat Pap test in 3 years.

Option B (Colposcopy), C (Cervical biopsy), and E (Excisional treatment) are incorrect as they are more invasive procedures that are not necessary for this patient at this time because her HPV test is negative. 

Option D (Repeat cytology and HPV testing in 3 years) is incorrect because, according to the guidelines, the repeat Pap test should be done every 3 years for a woman aged 21-65 years with ASC-US and negative HPV test. The HPV test is not repeated along with the Pap test every 3 years but rather every 5 years for women aged 30-65 years.

The management of abnormal Pap smear results depends on the specific cytologic abnormality detected as well as the patient's age and HPV status. For women aged 21-29 years, HPV cotesting is not recommended, so the next step after a Pap smear showing atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) is repeat cytology in one year. For women aged 30 years and older, HPV cotesting is recommended. An ASC-US result with negative HPV test in this age group is managed with routine screening because the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or 3 is very low.

9434,"This patient's ultrasound findings of gallbladder wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, and a positive Murphy's sign (ie, inspiratory arrest with palpation of the right subcostal area) are consistent with acute cholecystitis. This condition is most commonly due to a stone obstructing the cystic duct, leading to distension, inflammation, and infection of the gallbladder. Symptoms typically include fever, leukocytosis, and right upper quadrant pain that may radiate to the right shoulder. Alcohol abuse is not typically associated with gallstone disease; her daily heavy alcohol intake likely contributes to her hepatomegaly and her laboratory findings of mildly elevated total bilirubin, prolonged prothrombin time, and low albumin, which are suggestive of hepatic synthetic dysfunction.

The next step in management of acute cholecystitis is intravenous hydration, analgesia, and antibiotics (which cover gram-negative and anaerobic organisms) followed by urgent (within 72 hours) cholecystectomy. Delaying the surgery beyond 72 hours from symptom onset increases the risk of complications such as gangrenous cholecystitis or emphysematous cholecystitis.

508,"The patient's presentation is consistent with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). AMI can lead to decreased sympathetic output and increased vagal tone, causing bradycardia (pulse of 56/min). It can also cause decreased cardiac output, which can lead to cold, clammy skin and weakness. In these cases, the primary goal is to restore perfusion to the ischemic myocardium. This is achieved by decreasing myocardial oxygen demand and increasing myocardial oxygen supply.

5708,"The correct answer is B: â?? Serum parathyroid hormone, â?? Serum total calcium, â?? Serum calcitriol, â?? Urine phosphate.

Hyperphosphatemia can occur as a result of excessive phosphate intake, and it can lead to various systemic effects. One of the important responses to hyperphosphatemia is the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH is secreted by the parathyroid glands in response to low serum calcium levels and/or high serum phosphate levels. Therefore, in this case, the high-dose phosphate infusion would stimulate an increase in serum PTH (â?? Serum parathyroid hormone).

PTH has several actions that aim to normalize serum calcium and phosphate levels. It increases renal calcium reabsorption, which should increase serum calcium. However, because phosphate also promotes calcium deposition into bone and forms insoluble salts with calcium in the serum, the net effect of a phosphate load is a decrease in serum calcium (â?? Serum total calcium).

PTH also increases the production of calcitriol (active Vitamin D) by stimulating the enzyme 1-alpha-hydroxylase in the kidney. Calcitriol in turn increases calcium and phosphate absorption from the gut. However, the hyperphosphatemia inhibits the conversion of calcidiol to calcitriol, decreasing calcitriol levels (â?? Serum calcitriol).

Finally, PTH promotes phosphate excretion in the kidney, so we would expect to see an increase in urinary phosphate levels (â?? Urine phosphate).

The other options are incorrect as they do not accurately reflect the physiological responses to hyperphosphatemia. For example, a decrease in PTH (Option A and D) would not be expected in response to hyperphosphatemia. Similarly, an increase in serum total calcium (Option C and E) would not be expected due to the formation of insoluble salts and deposition into bone. An increase in serum calcitriol (Option C and D) would not be expected due to the inhibitory effect of hyperphosphatemia on its conversion from calcidiol. Lastly, a decrease in urine phosphate (Option A and D) would not be expected since PTH promotes phosphate excretion.","stop","the correct answer is b: â?? serum parathyroid hormone, â?? serum total calcium, â?? serum calcitriol, â?? urine phosphate.","B","C","USMLE question: An investigator is studying the effects of hyperphosphatemia on calcium homeostasis.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is B: 'â?? â?? â?? â??'

Hyperphosphatemia stimulates secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which in turn increases phosphate excretion in the urine, leading to a decrease in serum total calcium and calcitriol.

PTH is primarily regulated by serum calcium levels, but it is also sensitive to changes in serum phosphate. An increase in serum phosphate stimulates PTH secretion, which in turn increases the renal excretion of phosphate. This is the body's primary mechanism for preventing hyperphosphatemia.

High levels of PTH also increase the conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) in the kidney. Calcitriol increases intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate.

However, in this case of hyperphosphatemia, the high phosphate levels would cause a decline in calcitriol synthesis as a feedback mechanism to prevent further increase in phosphate levels. Also, PTH would promote calcium reabsorption in the kidney and bone resorption, to increase serum calcium levels. Despite these compensatory actions, the initial effect of phosphate load may cause serum total calcium to decrease due to formation of calcium-phosphate product.

The other options are incorrect mainly because they do not account for the body's compensatory mechanisms in response to hyperphosphatemia. For example, any option suggesting a decrease in PTH is incorrect because PTH levels would increase in response to high phosphate levels. Also, any option suggesting an increase in serum total calcium or calcitriol is incorrect because these would decrease as a result of the phosphate infusion."

A chest radiograph shows a focal homogenous opacity in the right lung suggestive of consolidation. Bacteriologic cultures of the blood, nasopharynx, and sputum grew Moraxella catarrhalis. Which of the following is the antibiotic of choice?
Option: {'A': 'Cefadroxil', 'B': 'Cephalexin', 'C': 'Doxycycline', 'D': 'Linezolid', 'E': 'Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is A: Cefadroxil.

This patient's fever, cough, rhonchi, increased tactile fremitus, and imaging findings of lobar consolidation are indicative of community-acquired pneumonia. The most common pathogens in children aged 5-15 are Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, this child's blood, nasopharynx, and sputum cultures are positive for Moraxella catarrhalis, a gram-negative diplococcus. M catarrhalis is a common cause of otitis media, sinusitis, and occasionally pneumonia in children. The right ear pain and erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane suggest concurrent acute otitis media.

Cefadroxil (Option A) and Cephalexin (Option B) are first-generation cephalosporins, which are effective against gram-positive cocci and some gram-negative bacilli. M catarrhalis, in particular, is almost universally susceptible to most cephalosporins. Although both options A and B would be appropriate for treatment, Cefadroxil is preferred as it can be given once daily compared to Cephalexin which usually needs to be given two to four times daily.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Option E) would be a poor choice because M catarrhalis is typically resistant to it. Additionally, Doxycycline (Option C) is not typically used for respiratory infections in children under 8 because it can cause permanent discoloration of teeth. Linezolid (Option D) is a more powerful antibiotic typically reserved for serious gram-positive infections, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE). This child's presentation does not suggest such a severe infection, so the use of Linezolid would not be appropriate."
2421,"The correct answer is B. Entacapone.

The patient's ""wearing-off"" symptoms (eg, end-of-dose worsening of parkinsonism) and ""on-off"" phenomena (eg, sudden, unpredictable changes in motor function) are common complications of chronic levodopa use in Parkinson disease. These occur due to progressive neuronal degeneration with disease progression, leading to a decreased therapeutic window for levodopa. The therapeutic strategies for managing these symptoms include increasing the frequency of levodopa dosing, adding a dopamine agonist, or adding a catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor (eg, entacapone).

Entacapone and tolcapone are COMT inhibitors that work peripherally in the gut and liver to block the metabolism of levodopa to 3-O-methyldopa, thereby increasing the bioavailability and prolonging the half-life of levodopa. By increasing the amount of levodopa that reaches the brain, these drugs can reduce motor fluctuations and allow for a reduction in the total daily levodopa dose.

The other options provided are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Carbidopa is a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor that is combined with levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It prevents the peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine, thus increasing the bioavailability of levodopa in the brain. However, it does not prevent peripheral methylation of levodopa.

C. Ropinirole is a dopamine agonist used in Parkinson's disease. It does not increase the bioavailability of levodopa.

D. Amantadine is an antiviral that is sometimes used in Parkinson's disease due to its mild antiparkinsonian effects. It does not increase the bioavailability of levodopa.

E. Rasagiline is a monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor used in Parkinson's disease. It does not increase the bioavailability of levodopa.","stop","the correct answer is b. entacapone.","B","B","USMLE question: A 72-year-old man with a 4-year history of Parkinson disease comes to the physician for evaluation of his medication.

One week ago, he was entirely unable to move for about a minute when he wanted to exit an elevator. The physician prescribes a drug that increases the bioavailability of levodopa by preferentially preventing its peripheral methylation. This patient was most likely prescribed which of the following drugs by the physician?

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is A. Carbidopa.

The patient's history of Parkinson disease with increasing bradykinesia and tremor before his next levodopa dose and ""on-off"" phenomenon (eg, sudden, temporary freezing) suggests progression of his disease and development of levodopa-related motor complications. Levodopa, the most effective drug for Parkinson disease, is typically coadministered with carbidopa, a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor. Carbidopa decreases the peripheral metabolism of levodopa to dopamine, thereby increasing the bioavailability of levodopa to cross the blood-brain barrier. This allows for lower doses of levodopa to be used, decreasing the risk of side effects.

The other choices are:
- Entacapone (option B) is a catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor that decreases the peripheral metabolism of levodopa, but it works by inhibiting methylation, not decarboxylation.
- Ropinirole (option C) is a dopamine agonist used in Parkinson disease that acts directly on the dopamine receptors. It does not increase the bioavailability of levodopa.
- Amantadine (option D) is an antiviral medication that also has anti-Parkinson properties by increasing dopamine release, decreasing dopamine reuptake, and blocking glutamate neurotransmission. It does not increase the bioavailability of levodopa.
- Rasagiline (option E) is a monoamine oxidase type B inhibitor that decreases the metabolism of dopamine in the brain, prolonging the effects of levodopa. It does not increase the bioavailability of levodopa."
9258,"The symptoms of this patient are suggestive of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), which is a potentially lethal complication of chemotherapy in patients with malignancies that have a high tumor burden. The syndrome is caused by massive tumor cell lysis with the release of large amounts of potassium, phosphate, and nucleic acids into the systemic circulation. Catabolism of the nucleic acids to hypoxanthine and then to uric acid leads to hyperuricemia. Precipitation of uric acid in the renal tubules can cause acute renal failure. The increased phosphate can bind to calcium and cause hypocalcemia. 

The correct answer is B (Hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, urine supernatant pink, and positive for heme) as it includes the most common findings associated with tumor lysis syndrome: hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, and acute kidney injury manifesting as oliguria and edema. The presence of a pink urine supernatant and heme-positive urinalysis in the absence of red blood cells suggests the presence of uric acid or its oxidation product, allantoin.

This position is incompatible with vaginal delivery and if it persists to term, a cesarean section will be necessary. However, as the patient prefers a vaginal delivery, an external cephalic version (ECV) can be attempted after 36 weeks of gestation. ECV is a procedure where the obstetrician uses his or her hands on the outside of the mother's abdomen to try to manually turn the baby into a head-down position. The procedure is successful in about 50% of cases and reduces the need for cesarean delivery.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

At 32 weeks gestation, it's not uncommon for the fetus to change its positioning. However, by 36 weeks, most fetuses should have moved into the head-down (cephalic) position in preparation for a vaginal delivery. If the fetus is in a transverse or breech position at this time, an external cephalic version (ECV) is typically recommended. ECV involves the healthcare provider applying pressure to the mother's abdomen in order to manually turn the fetus into the head-down position. This procedure is successful about 50% of the time and can allow the woman to have a vaginal delivery, thereby avoiding a caesarean section.

Option 'A' is incorrect because expectant management simply involves waiting and monitoring, which could lead to an emergency situation if the fetus does not move into the correct position by the time of delivery. 

Option 'B' is incorrect because weekly ultrasounds would only monitor the situation but not actively address the problem of the fetus being in the transverse position.

Option 'D' is incorrect because internal cephalic version is not typically done due to the high risk of complications, including fetal distress, cord prolapse, or placental abruption.

2127,"This patient's sudden, severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, accompanied by nausea and vomiting, is suggestive of acute pancreatitis. The most common causes of acute pancreatitis are gallstones and alcohol use. Her lipase level is more than three times the upper limit of normal, which confirms the diagnosis. Measurement of lipase is favored over amylase because it is more sensitive and specific for pancreatitis. 

The next step in management is to determine the cause of the pancreatitis. In a woman of this age who reports having dinner and drinks, both gallstone and alcohol-induced pancreatitis are possible. Transabdominal ultrasound (Option B) is the best initial test to assess for gallstones and other evidence of biliary tract disease (eg, biliary ductal dilation). If ultrasound is not diagnostic and the patient's symptoms persist, a contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan (Option A) can be useful in identifying other causes of acute pancreatitis (eg, tumors, pancreatic necrosis) and assessing for complications.

Option C (plain x-ray of the abdomen) is not helpful in diagnosing acute pancreatitis, as the pancreas is not well visualized on plain films.

217,"The correct answer is 'A': Microtubule. 

Microtubules are the primary components of the neuronal cytoskeleton and are the backbone of the axon. The axon is the long, slender projection of a nerve cell, or neuron, that typically conducts electrical impulses away from the neuron's cell body (soma). Aniline dyes are unable to stain microtubules, therefore the axon cannot be visualized in this experiment. 

The other options are incorrect because:

'B': The Nucleus is present in the soma or cell body, not the axon. Thus, it wouldn't have an effect on the visibility of the axon. 

'C': Lysosomes are involved in degradation and recycling of cellular components, but don't play a specific role in axonal structure or visibility. 

'D': The Golgi apparatus is involved in packaging and transport of proteins, but it's not specific to axons. 

'E': Rough endoplasmic reticulum is involved in protein synthesis and is located in the cell body, not the axon.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The answer is A: Microtubule.

The staining pattern described in the question is due to the presence of Nissl bodies, which are structures located within the soma and dendrites, but not the axons, of neurons. Nissl bodies are composed of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and are involved in protein synthesis. Aniline stains are used to visualize Nissl bodies.

Even though Nissl bodies are essentially RER, the question specifically asks for the cellular element that explains the absence of staining in the axons. This is because microtubules are responsible for transporting substances (including those synthesized by the RER) from the soma to the axon. However, since axons lack RER (and therefore Nissl bodies), they do not stain with aniline. 

Nucleus (option B) is present in the soma of the neuron, but its presence or absence does not explain the staining pattern. Lysosomes (option C) are involved in digestion of cellular waste and are present throughout the neuron, but again, their presence or absence does not explain the staining pattern. The Golgi apparatus (option D) is involved in packaging and shipping proteins, but it also does not specifically explain the staining pattern.

This physician's symptoms suggest that he is experiencing burnout, which is a state of chronic physical and emotional exhaustion often also involving a sense of reduced accomplishment and loss of personal identity. Burnout is a major problem in medicine, with rates substantially higher than those in the general population. Physicians often work long hours and have a high level of responsibility, which contributes to stress and burnout. It is worth noting that increased computerization and pressure to see more patients can also contribute to feelings of burnout. However, according to recent surveys, physicians more frequently recognize 'working too many hours' as a major contributor to burnout.

Option A is incorrect because the number of patients on a physician's panel may not directly correlate with burnout. It is more about the time spent and workload rather than just the number of patients. 

Option B is incorrect because while excessive bureaucratic tasks can contribute to burnout, it is not the most frequently recognized contributor according to national surveys.

Option D is incorrect because, although a negative online reputation can cause stress, it is not recognized as a frequent contributor to physician burnout compared to other factors.

The physician is likely experiencing burnout, which is a long-term stress reaction marked by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a lack of sense of personal accomplishment. A contributing factor to burnout is working too many hours (choice C). He is spending a significant amount of time visiting patients (about 51 hours per week seeing 20 patients a day). This amount of work without adequate rest and recovery could lead to physical and emotional exhaustion.

Choice A (The number of patients on his panel) is not likely the primary contributor. Although a high number of patients could contribute to stress, it's the amount of time spent working (regardless of the number of patients) that is a more significant factor in burnout.

Choice B (Excessive bureaucratic tasks) could also contribute to burnout but there is no information provided in the question stem suggesting this is a primary concern for this doctor.

Choice D (Concern over online reputation) could certainly add stress, but the question doesn't give any indication that this is the major stressor for the doctor. Moreover, it's more likely that the negative reviews are an effect of the doctor's burnout, rather than the cause.

Choice E (The number of geriatric patients on his panel) is unlikely to be the main issue. While geriatric patients may have more complex needs, there's no specific information in the question suggesting that this is the primary stressor for this doctor. 

Therefore, 'working too many hours' is the most likely contributor to this physician's burnout."
2339,"The patient's symptoms of menstrual irregularities, hirsutism, and obesity are characteristic of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries. It is one of the most common causes of female infertility. The pathophysiology of PCOS is complex and multifactorial, but insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia play a key role, leading to increased ovarian androgen production. This is why women with PCOS have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the best initial treatment for this patient would be lifestyle modifications such as exercise and weight loss (Option B). Weight loss can help reduce insulin resistance, improve menstrual irregularities, and decrease hirsutism. In terms of comorbid conditions to look for, testing for insulin resistance and potential fertility issues would be recommended. 

Option A is not the best choice, as the initial management of PCOS should be lifestyle modifications, not oral contraceptives. Oral contraceptives can be used as a second-line treatment, especially in patients who are not planning to conceive and need symptom control for hirsutism and irregular periods.

This patient's findings of hirsutism, obesity, menstrual irregularities, and likely polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) suggest a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age, PCOS is characterized by hyperandrogenism (manifesting as hirsutism and acne), chronic anovulation (manifesting as menstrual irregularities), and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound.

First-line treatment for PCOS is weight loss, which can help normalize menstrual cycles and improve hirsutism and insulin sensitivity. This option is preferred over combined oral contraceptives as the initial therapy, which are a second-line treatment used if lifestyle modifications are unsuccessful or if a rapid response is needed (eg, severe hyperandrogenism).

Insulin resistance is a key pathophysiologic feature of PCOS, increasing the risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, patients with PCOS should undergo screening for insulin resistance. PCOS is also associated with an increased prevalence of infertility due to chronic anovulation.

This patient's presentation of fatigue, pallor, and microcytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume [MCV] <80 fL) is suggestive of iron deficiency anemia (IDA). IDA often results from either decreased intake (eg, vegetarian diet), malabsorption (eg, celiac disease), or blood loss. Given this patient's age, gastrointestinal blood loss is most likely and will need to be evaluated after her anemia is treated. However, the lack of response to oral iron therapy suggests that she may have malabsorption of iron, as can be seen in patients with celiac disease or Helicobacter pylori infection, among other conditions. Therefore, the best next step in management is to start intravenous iron therapy, which bypasses the gastrointestinal tract. 

Option A (Transfuse the patient with whole blood) is incorrect because blood transfusion is typically reserved for patients with severe anemia (hemoglobin <7 g/dL) or those with symptoms of end-organ damage (eg, chest pain).

Option B (Continue oral ferrous sulfate and supplement with ascorbic acid) is incorrect because ascorbic acid enhances iron absorption, however, this patient has not responded to oral iron therapy, suggesting possible malabsorption.

Option C (Continue oral ferrous sulfate and supplement with omeprazole) is incorrect because proton pump inhibitors like omeprazole can decrease iron absorption and would not be beneficial in this case.

This patient with daily alcohol use has a microcytic anemia with thrombocytosis. In patients with chronic alcoholism, the most common hematologic abnormalities include macrocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and occasionally, pancytopenia due to bone marrow suppression. However, in a patient with microcytic anemia, it is more likely to be secondary to iron deficiency which can occur from various causes including malnutrition, malabsorption, and gastrointestinal blood loss. Importantly, alcohol-induced gastrointestinal blood loss is common and can be insidious. In such cases, oral iron replacement can be inadequate due to ongoing blood loss or poor absorption. Hence, intravenous iron supplementation (Option E) would be the most appropriate next step when oral iron therapy fails.

Option A: Transfusion of whole blood is unnecessary at this point as her hemoglobin level is not critically low.

Option B: Supplementing with ascorbic acid can enhance iron absorption, but in the face of alcohol-induced gastrointestinal losses or malabsorption, it may not be sufficient.

Option C: Omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, reduces gastric acid production and can further impair iron absorption making it a poor choice.

8911,"The patient's echocardiography findings of a right-to-left shunt through the atrial septum during coughing suggest a patent foramen ovale (PFO), a common congenital cardiac abnormality. The foramen ovale is a normal structure in fetal life that enables oxygenated blood from the placenta to bypass the non-functioning fetal lungs. Normally, the foramen ovale closes soon after birth when increased left atrial pressure seals the flap-like septum primum against the septum secundum. However, in about 25% of individuals, the foramen ovale does not close completely, resulting in a PFO. Although usually asymptomatic, PFO can paradoxically embolize venous thrombi to the arterial circulation, potentially causing an ischemic stroke. 

The failure of the foramen ovale to close after birth is similar to the failure of the thyroglossal duct to obliterate during embryologic development. The thyroglossal duct is an embryologic structure that forms the thyroid gland. Normally, it involutes and disappears by the 10th week of gestation. If it fails to do so, remnants can form a thyroglossal duct cyst (option D), a palpable midline neck mass that moves with swallowing or protrusion of the tongue.

A PFO is a common congenital heart defect that results from failure of the foramen ovale to close after birth. The foramen ovale normally allows right-to-left shunting in utero to bypass the nonfunctional fetal lungs. After birth, increased pulmonary blood flow and decreased right atrial pressure facilitate its closure. If this process fails, the foramen ovale remains patent and may only become evident if a transient increase in right atrial pressure (eg, due to coughing, straining) results in a right-to-left shunt.

Initially, patients may report paresthesias in the hands and feet, followed by proximal muscle weakness that peaks in severity in 4 weeks. Autonomic dysfunction, such as labile blood pressure and cardiac arrhythmias, can also occur. GBS is a diagnosis of exclusion in a patient who presents with progressive, ascending paralysis.

The other options describe the characteristics of different bacteria that do not typically precede GBS:
A) Gram-positive bacillus is broad and could refer to many bacteria, but none are typically associated with GBS.
C) Gram-negative, oxidase-positive, comma-shaped bacteria describes Vibrio cholerae, not typically associated with GBS.
D) Gram-negative, oxidase-negative, bacillus with hydrogen sulfide gas production describes Salmonella, not typically associated with GBS.
E) Gram-negative, oxidase-negative, bacillus without hydrogen sulfide gas production describes E. coli, not typically associated with GBS."
5787,"The correct answer is A, ""Prolongation of chloride channel opening"".

The scenario describes a patient with status epilepticus, a medical emergency characterized by a seizure lasting more than 5 minutes, or the occurrence of more than one seizure within a 5-minute period without the person returning to normal between them. First-line treatment for status epilepticus is the administration of benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, diazepam, or midazolam. These drugs work by binding to the GABA-A receptor and increasing the duration of chloride channel opening. This allows more chloride ions to enter the neuron, which hyperpolarizes the cell and makes it less likely to depolarize and initiate an action potential, thereby reducing neuronal excitability and helping to stop the seizure.

Option B is incorrect. Drugs that increase the frequency of chloride channel opening, such as barbiturates, are not the first-line treatment for status epilepticus.

Option C is incorrect. Drugs that block voltage-gated calcium channels, such as gabapentin and pregabalin, are used in the treatment of neuropathic pain and certain types of seizures, but not status epilepticus.

Option D is incorrect. Sodium channel inactivators, such as carbamazepine and phenytoin, can be used as second-line treatment for status epilepticus if benzodiazepines are ineffective, but they are not the first choice.

This patient's presentation of a prolonged seizure (>5 minutes) is consistent with status epilepticus, a neurological emergency that requires immediate treatment to prevent long-term neuronal injury. First-line treatment for status epilepticus is benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam, diazepam), which enhance Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity by prolonging the duration of chloride channel openings. This results in hyperpolarization of the neuron and decreased ability to reach the threshold potential necessary for action potential propagation.

Option B (Increase in frequency of chloride channel opening) is incorrect because this is the mechanism of action for barbiturates such as phenobarbital, not benzodiazepines.

Option C (Blockage of voltage-gated calcium channels) is incorrect because this is the mechanism of action for drugs like gabapentin and pregabalin. These drugs are used primarily for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia, and as adjuncts in epilepsy, not for acute management of status epilepticus.

Option D (Inactivation of sodium channels) is incorrect because this mechanism is seen with drugs like phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproate. These drugs are used for long-term management of seizures, not for acute management of status epilepticus.

A confounder is a variable that influences both the dependent variable and independent variable, causing a spurious association.

5472,"The correct answer is A: Vaccinate: 2 weeks prior to surgery; Penicillin: 2 weeks prior to surgery for an indefinite course.

Splenectomy increases the risk of infection with encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Neisseria meningitidis due to the spleen's role in opsonization and removal of these organisms. To mitigate this risk, patients should be vaccinated 2 weeks prior to surgery, when the spleen is still functional, to allow time for the body to mount an immune response. 

In addition, penicillin prophylaxis should be started 2 weeks prior to surgery and continued indefinitely in individuals over the age of 50 or those with other risk factors (e.g., immunocompromised status). This is because the risk of overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI), while greatest within the first 2 years after surgery, remains elevated for life.

Patients undergoing splenectomy are at increased risk of infection by encapsulated organisms like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae. Therefore, it is recommended to vaccinate these patients against these organisms at least two weeks prior to the surgery to allow for adequate development of protective immunity.

The appropriate timing of antibiotic prophylaxis with penicillin for these patients is less clearly defined, but it is generally started around the time of surgery. It is typically continued indefinitely in patients who have had a splenectomy, especially those older than age 50 or who have had their spleen removed due to a hematologic malignancy or other disorder (like ITP) that affects the immune system. 

The other options are incorrect because they do not align with these recommendations. Options B and C propose starting penicillin prophylaxis at the time of surgery â?? this would be too late to provide adequate protection. Option C also proposes to stop penicillin prophylaxis after 5 years, which is not recommended for this patient due to her age and underlying immune disorder.

8852,"The patient's presentation of unconsciousness and rapid heart rate suggests an acute metabolic disturbance. The high serum osmolality indicates that he is hyperosmolar, which is most often due to hyperglycemia. The other primary cause of elevated serum osmolality, hypernatremia, is unlikely because he is not markedly hypertensive.

Given these findings, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and nonketotic hyperosmolar hyperglycemic coma (NKHHC) are the most likely diagnoses. However, patients with DKA usually present with Kussmaul respirations (rapid, deep breathing), which this patient does not have. In addition, they typically have a glucose level >250 mg/dL, a bicarbonate level <18 mEq/L, and a pH <7.30, none of which can be confirmed in this case. On the other hand, NKHHC typically occurs in patients with type 2 diabetes and is characterized by severe hyperglycemia (>600 mg/dL), hyperosmolarity (>320 mOsm/kg), and altered consciousness, which fits this patient's presentation. Therefore, the correct answer is D, nonketotic hyperosmolar hyperglycemic coma.

Option A, acute ethanol intoxication, can cause altered mental status, but it typically does not cause hyperosmolarity. Option B, central diabetes insipidus, can cause hypernatremia and thus increase serum osmolality, but it is not associated with hyperglycemia or altered mental status.

2,"The correct answer is D. Abnormal hypertrophy of the pylorus. 

The infant's regurgitation of all his feeds and yellow vomiting are classic symptoms of pyloric stenosis. Pyloric stenosis is a condition in which the opening from the stomach to the first part of the small intestine (the pylorus) becomes narrowed due to hypertrophy of the smooth muscle layer in this region. This restricts the stomach's ability to empty its contents into the small intestine, leading to regurgitation and projectile vomiting. The vomit is typically described as ""olive-like"" or yellow in color.

Option A, abnormal migration of ventral pancreatic bud, leads to pancreas divisum or annular pancreas, which does not match the presentation.

Option B, complete failure of proximal duodenum to recanalize, leads to duodenal atresia, which would present with bilious vomiting immediately after birth.

Option C, error in neural crest cell migration, leads to Hirschsprung disease, which presents with constipation and abdominal distension, not vomiting.

Option E, failure of lateral body folds to move ventrally and fuse in the midline, leads to omphalocele or gastroschisis, which would be apparent at birth with abdominal organs outside of the body.

The most characteristic feature is nonbilious vomiting, which can be projectile, occurring shortly after feeds. In more severe cases, infants may present with signs of dehydration and jaundice, and a 'string sign' or 'olive-like mass' in the right upper quadrant can sometimes be palpated. Therefore, the correct answer is 'D: Abnormal hypertrophy of the pylorus'.

Option A, 'Abnormal migration of ventral pancreatic bud', is incorrect because this would lead to annular pancreas, a condition where the second part of the duodenum is surrounded by a ring of pancreatic tissue continuous with the head of the pancreas.

This patient's tachycardia, irregularly irregular heartbeat, and decreased S1 intensity suggest atrial fibrillation (AF). In AF, multiple ectopic foci in the atria lead to chaotic, disorganized electrical activity, with subsequent deterioration of atrial mechanical function. Loss of effective atrial contraction results in varying intervals between ventricular contractions, leading to an irregularly irregular rhythm and decreased S1 intensity (which varies with changes in the length of diastole). Rate control (ie, keeping the heart rate <110/min at rest) is a crucial part of AF management and can be achieved with Ã? blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem), or digoxin. However, in the setting of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (ie, heart failure), Ã? blockers and digoxin are preferred as initial therapy as verapamil and diltiazem may further depress myocardial contractility. This patient is already on metoprolol for rate control and heart failure, but it appears to be insufficient as her heart rate is still 125/min.

Option: {'A': 'Esophagogastroduodenoscopy', 'B': 'CT scan of the abdomen', 'C': 'Hydrogen breath test', 'D': 'Cardiac stress test', 'E': 'Abdominal ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's abdominal discomfort with exertion and postprandial discomfort may suggest ""abdominal angina"" due to chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI). CMI is most frequently observed in patients with generalized atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease which can be surmised from this patient's history of smoking, peripheral arterial disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The splanchnic circulation has a rich collateral flow. Consequently, at least two of the three major splanchnic vessels (celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, inferior mesenteric artery) must be significantly stenotic before symptoms of CMI develop. This patient's postprandial abdominal pain is due to an inability to augment splanchnic blood flow in response to increased metabolic demand after meals. As a result, patients may eat less and lose weight. The pain after a ""big meal"" and his inability to gain symptomatic relief despite a significant decrease in food intake due to fear of provoking the pain support this diagnosis. Atherosclerosis in other vascular beds can cause symptoms (eg, claudication), but this patient's discomfort with walking is more likely to be due to his deconditioning and obesity than to his stage 2 peripheral arterial disease, which is typically asymptomatic. Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) of the abdomen is the best initial diagnostic test for CMI. Therefore, Answer 'B' (CT scan of the abdomen) is the most likely answer.

Option 'A' (Esophagogastroduodenoscopy) is not indicated as this patient doesn't show any alarming symptoms like weight loss, anemia, or dysphagia that are typical for upper GI malignancies. 
Option 'C' (Hydrogen breath test) is used to diagnose conditions like lactose intolerance and bacterial overgrowth, which are not likely in this case.
Option 'D' (Cardiac stress test) is not necessary since there's no evidence of cardiac disease. 
Option 'E' (Abdominal ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant) is usually used to evaluate hepatobiliary disease, which this patient doesn't seem to have."
19,"Based on the information provided, the patient likely has Wilson disease, a copper metabolism disorder characterized by excessive deposition of copper in the liver, brain, cornea, and kidney.

However, basing the answer on the given details and the options provided, the most likely answer would be 'E': 'Dark corneal ring on slit-lamp examination.' 

The patient's age, his symptoms (jaundice, dark urine), his lab findings (elevated ALT and AST), and the use of periodic acid-Schiff-staining in his liver biopsy suggest liver disease, possibly due to a metabolic disorder such as Wilson's disease.

Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective copper transport, leading to copper accumulation in various tissues, including the liver, brain, and cornea. The dark corneal ring (Kayser-Fleischer ring) is a classic ocular manifestation of this disease.

Now, let's discuss why the other choices are unlikely:

Option 'A' refers to Whipple disease, a systemic disorder caused by the bacterium Tropheryma whipplei. While it can cause malabsorption and weight loss, it is not typically associated with liver disease or the findings described.

Option 'B' refers to conditions such as COPD or Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, which would typically present with respiratory symptoms, not just liver disease.

Option 'C' describes a cholangiogram seen in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a disease that typically presents with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, which is not mentioned here.

Option 'D' refers to iron overload conditions like Hemochromatosis. While this condition can cause liver disease, myocardial iron deposition would be an uncommon initial presentation, and the patientâ??s described presentation does not align well with hemochromatosis. 

Remember that while the most likely answer based on the provided information is Wilson's disease, the diagnosis would typically require additional tests like serum/urinary copper and ceruloplasmin levels. Also, the liver biopsy in Wilson's disease would usually show steatosis, glycogenated nuclei, and copper deposits."
23,"The patient's symptoms of tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, agitation, and visual hallucinations along with altered sensorium are suggestive of delirium tremens (Option C). Delirium tremens is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that occurs in patients with chronic alcoholism who abruptly stop drinking. It usually starts 48-96 hours after the last drink and can last up to 5-7 days. Symptoms include altered mental status (disorientation, hallucinations, agitation), autonomic hyperactivity (tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, diaphoresis), and generalized seizures. It is a medical emergency and can be fatal if not treated immediately with benzodiazepines.

25,"The correct answer is A: Urinary pH: 7.3.

This patient's severe, colicky flank pain that radiates to the groin, along with the finding of a stone in the ureter, is suggestive of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones). The most common type of kidney stones are calcium oxalate stones, which are often seen in patients with hypercalciuria. However, his history of podagra (painful inflammation of the first metatarsophalangeal joint) suggests gout, which is often associated with uric acid stones. Uric acid stones are radiolucent and, therefore, not visible on conventional radiography. They are often diagnosed by noncontrast spiral computed tomography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder, as in this patient. Uric acid stones form in acidic urine (urinary pH < 5.5). However, this patient's treatment with amlodipine for hypertension may have resulted in a metabolic alkalosis, which would increase the urinary pH.

Option B: Urinary pH: 4.7 is incorrect as this would favor the formation of uric acid stones. However, the patient's treatment with amlodipine may have resulted in a metabolic alkalosis, which would increase urinary pH.

Option C: Hexagonal shaped crystals are characteristic of cystine stones, not uric acid stones. Cystinuria is a rare, autosomal recessive disease that results in defective renal tubular reabsorption of cystine, leading to cystine precipitation and stone formation.

Option D: Positive nitrites test indicates the presence of a urinary tract infection, which can cause struvite stones (composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate). However, this patient's presentation is more suggestive of a uric acid stone.

This patient's severe, colicky, right-sided flank pain that radiates to his right groin is characteristic of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones). His history of being treated with naproxen for swelling and pain in his right toe indicates gout, which often is associated with uric acid nephrolithiasis, as both conditions are due to overproduction or underexcretion of uric acid. However, the most common type of nephrolithiasis is calcium oxalate, which can occur in patients with hypercalciuria from any cause. Uric acid stones are radiolucent and may not be seen on an x-ray, as in this patient. Calcium oxalate stones are more likely to be seen on x-ray, but a negative x-ray does not rule out the presence of a stone, as shown in this patient's CT scan. Patients with uric acid stones often have acidic urine (pH < 5.5). In contrast, calcium oxalate stones are more likely to form in alkaline urine (pH > 7.0).

Option B: Urinary pH: 4.7 is incorrect because it is associated with uric acid stones, which are less likely given this patient's history and CT findings.

Option C: Hexagon shaped crystals are associated with cystinuria, a genetic disorder that results in defective renal tubular transport of cystine, leading to recurrent nephrolithiasis. This patient has no history of recurrent stones, making this option less likely.

Congenital CMV infection can cause a variety of symptoms and complications, including sensorineural hearing loss, mental retardation, seizures, petechiae, purpura, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, and periventricular calcifications.

While CMV can cause a variety of systemic issues, it is not typically associated with congenital heart defects. However, patients with Down syndrome, which is associated with maternal age >35, have an increased risk of congenital heart disease, most commonly atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with VSD being the most common.

53,"The correct answer is A. A toxoid vaccine within ten days of exposure. 

This patient's symptoms are suggestive of rabies, a fatal encephalitis caused by the rabies virus. Initial symptoms include fever, headache, and general malaise, followed by neurologic symptoms such as agitation, hydrophobia (fear of water), and hallucinations. Rabies is transmitted through the saliva of an infected animal, often through bites. Rabies is endemic in bats in the United States.

Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is recommended for all individuals with a bite, scratch, or mucous membrane exposure to a bat, unless the bat is available for testing and is negative for rabies. PEP consists of rabies immune globulin injected around the wound (if any) and at a distant site, plus a series of four doses of rabies vaccine given on days 0, 3, 7, and 14. Rabies immune globulin provides immediate, passive immunity. The vaccine induces an active immune response that takes approximately 7-10 days to become effective.

The other options are incorrect:
B. A killed vaccine within ten days of exposure: Rabies vaccine is a killed-virus vaccine, but it is not enough on its own. It must be given in conjunction with rabies immune globulin for post-exposure prophylaxis.

The incubation period can vary from weeks to months, depending on the location and severity of the inoculating wound.

Rabies is nearly universally fatal once clinical signs appear, so postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is essential after potential exposure, even when no bite was identified, as bat bites may be subtle or not recognized. Rabies PEP includes wound washing and administration of both human rabies immune globulin and a series of doses of rabies vaccine.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of a test can be calculated using the information provided.

First, let's identify the different parameters:

The true positives (TP) are the patients with a disease who are correctly identified by the screening test as having the disease. In this case, the test detected 200 patients with diabetic retinopathy as confirmed by the ophthalmologist exam.

The false positives (FP) are the patients without the disease who are incorrectly identified by the screening test as having the disease. In this case, the test incorrectly detected retinopathy in 250 (total who tested positive in the screening test) - 200 (confirmed by ophthalmologist) = 50 patients.

The true negatives (TN) are the patients without the disease who are correctly identified by the screening test as not having the disease. In this case, the total number of patients is 500 and 250 patients tested positive in the screening test, so 500 - 250 = 250 tested negative. Of those, 250 (tested negative) - 10 (confirmed to have retinopathy by ophthalmologist) = 240 are the true negatives.

The false negatives (FN) are the patients with the disease who are incorrectly identified by the screening test as not having the disease. In this case, we know that 10 patients who tested negative in the screening test were confirmed to have retinopathy by the ophthalmologist.

With these values, we can calculate:

- Sensitivity (also called the true positive rate) measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified as such. Sensitivity = TP / (TP+FN) = 200 / (200+10) = 95%.
- Specificity (also called the true negative rate) measures the proportion of negatives that are correctly identified. Specificity = TN / (TN+FP) = 240 / (240+50) = 83%.
- PPV or Positive Predictive Value is the probability that subjects with a positive screening test truly have the disease. PPV = TP / (TP+FP) = 200 / (200+50) = 80%
- NPV or Negative Predictive Value is the probability that subjects with a negative screening test truly don't have the disease. NPV = TN / (TN+FN) = 240 / (240+10) = 96%

So, the correct answer is 'A': 'Sensitivity = 95%, Specificity = 83%, PPV = 80%, NPV = 96%'.

The other options are incorrect as they either mix up the values for sensitivity and specificity, or they mix up the values for PPV and NPV."
61,"Answer: D. 'Fused tetanic contraction at the end of all three experiments'

Explanation: 

This research study involving different types of muscle contractions provides an excellent opportunity to understand basic physiology concepts. Let's break down the question to understand why option D is the correct choice.

In phase 1, the participant lifts a 5 lb weight. This action involves the biceps brachii, a skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscles are made up of motor units, each comprising a motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates. When a motor unit is activated, all its muscle fibers contract. The size of a motor unit (i.e., the number of muscle fibers innervated) can vary greatly, and smaller motor units are generally recruited first. However, the weight in this case is relatively small, and the participant is healthy, so it's unlikely that large motor units are recruited, making option C incorrect.

In phase 2, the participant does 20 burpees, which accelerates his heart rate. This phase focuses on cardiac muscle, not skeletal muscle. Cardiac muscle is involuntary and contains its own inherent pacemaker cells. It does not rely on the recruitment of motor units for contraction like skeletal muscle. Therefore, option A is incorrect.

In phase 3, the participant's gastrocnemius (a skeletal muscle) is electrically stimulated at a frequency of 50 Hz. High-frequency stimulation of skeletal muscle can lead to a fused (complete) tetanic contraction. In this state, the muscle does not relax between stimuli, leading to a sustained, forceful contraction.

This leads us to option D, 'Fused tetanic contraction at the end of all three experiments'. Phase 1 likely won't end in a tetanic contraction because the weight is light. Phase 2 involves the cardiac muscle, which behaves differently from skeletal muscle. However, phase 3 will likely result in a tetanic contraction due to high-frequency stimulation. So, while not all phases end in tetanic contractions, option D is the best fit out of the options provided.

Option B is incorrect because tension might increase in phases 1 and 3 but not in 2 as the underlying mechanism of contraction in cardiac muscle (phase 2) is different from that in skeletal muscle (phases 1 and 3). 

Option E is incorrect because while tension might increase in phases 1 and 3 as the participant exerts effort, this is not the case for phase 2 as the cardiac muscle doesn't work that way. It has a different physiology from skeletal muscle. 

So, the most accurate answer would be D. 'Fused tetanic contraction at the end of all three experiments'.","stop","answer: d. 'fused tetanic contraction at the end of all three experiments'

this research study involving different types of muscle contractions provides an excellent opportunity to understand basic physiology concepts.","D","E","USMLE question: A healthy 22-year-old male participates in a research study you are leading to compare the properties of skeletal and cardiac muscle. You conduct a 3-phased experiment with the participant. In the first phase, you get him to lift up a 2.3 kg (5 lb) weight off a table with his left hand. In the second phase, you get him to do 20 burpees, taking his heart rate to 150/min. In the third phase, you electrically stimulate his gastrocnemius with a frequency of 50 Hz. You are interested in the tension and electrical activity of specific muscles as follows: Biceps in phase 1, cardiac muscle in phase 2, and gastrocnemius in phase 3. What would you expect to be happening in the phases and the respective muscles of interest?
Option: {'A': 'Recruitment of small motor units at the start of experiments 1 and 2', 'B': 'Increase of tension in experiments 2 and 3, with the same underlying mechanism', 'C': 'Recruitment of large motor units followed by small motor units in experiment 1', 'D': 'Fused tetanic contraction at the end of all three experiments', 'E': 'Increase of tension in all phases'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is D: Fused tetanic contraction at the end of all three experiments. 

Here's why:

Phase 1: Lifting a 2.3 kg weight would require the biceps to contract. This contraction is a result of motor unit recruitment which involves the firing of multiple motor neurons. However, the force generated by the muscle is not enough to cause a fused tetanic contraction. 

Phase 2: During the burpees, the heart rate increases to 150/min. The cardiac muscle fibers are interconnected, allowing for a rapid spread of action potentials. This results in a synchronized contraction of the heart. Cardiac muscle is not subject to tetanic contractions due to its long refractory period.

Phase 3: Electrical stimulation of the gastrocnemius at a frequency of 50 Hz would likely result in a fused tetanic contraction. This is because the high frequency stimulation would not allow the muscle to relax between stimuli, leading to a sustained contraction.

Option A is incorrect because smaller motor units are typically recruited first, but only in phase 1. The heart does not have motor units. 

Option B is incorrect because the increase in tension in phase 2 and 3 would have different underlying mechanisms. In phase 2, the increase in tension would be due to an increase in heart rate and in phase 3, it would be due to electrical stimulation. 

Option C is incorrect because smaller motor units are typically recruited first due to their lower threshold for action potential generation. 

Option E is incorrect because the tension would not necessarily be increased in all phases, particularly in phase 2, where the main muscle of interest is the cardiac muscle, which does not increase tension in the same manner as skeletal muscle."
81,"The correct answer is B, 11Ã?-hydroxylase. 

The patient's presentation suggests congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), a family of autosomal recessive disorders involving impaired cortisol synthesis. The most common form of CAH is 21-hydroxylase deficiency, but that is typically associated with salt wasting and hypotension due to decreased mineralocorticoid synthesis, which is not seen in this patient. 

Instead, this patient has hypertension (suggested by the increased renin, a compensatory response to hypertension) and early puberty (suggested by the increased height percentile and pubic hair), both of which are associated with 11Ã?-hydroxylase deficiency. This form of CAH is characterized by decreased cortisol synthesis and an overproduction of 11-deoxycorticosterone, a potent mineralocorticoid, causing hypertension, and androgens, causing virilization.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: 

A: 17a-hydroxylase deficiency would lead to decreased sex hormones and glucocorticoids, with an overproduction of mineralocorticoids. This would cause hypertension, but not virilization. 

C: As mentioned earlier, 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the most common form of CAH, typically presents with salt wasting and hypotension, not hypertension.

D: Aromatase deficiency would lead to an inability to convert androgens into estrogens, leading to virilization in females, but would not cause the mineralocorticoid excess seen here.

This patient's findings suggest 11Ã?-hydroxylase deficiency, a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). This condition results in excessive production of adrenal androgens, causing virilization (as evidenced by the presence of pubic hair) and tall stature in childhood (due to early epiphyseal plate closure). The deficiency also leads to overproduction of 11-deoxycorticosterone, a mineralocorticoid precursor, which leads to hypertension and hypokalemia (hence the high renin and potassium levels). Lastly, the high 17-hydroxyprogesterone is a common finding in all forms of CAH due to feedback upregulation of ACTH.

Option A, 17a-hydroxylase deficiency, presents as female phenotype in both genetic males and females (due to lack of sex hormone production) and hypertension (due to increased mineralocorticoid production). 

Option C, 21-hydroxylase deficiency, is the most common form of CAH, which usually presents with salt wasting and virilization, but not with hypertension.

Option D, Aromatase deficiency, results in masculinization of external genitalia in genetic females and tall stature in both males and females, but it does not cause hypertension.

82,"This patient's symptoms of psychiatric disturbances, abdominal pain, and neurologic findings such as confusion and disorientation suggest acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). AIP is due to a deficiency of the enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase, which is involved in heme synthesis.

So, the answer is D: Porphobilinogen.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is A. Aminolevulinic acid.

This patient's periodic abdominal pain and neurologic signs (e.g., emotional lability, confusion) are suggestive of acute intermittent porphyria. Acute intermittent porphyria is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase (also known as hydroxymethylbilane synthase). This enzyme defect leads to an accumulation of aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen, precursors in the heme synthesis pathway. An attack can be precipitated by certain medications (e.g., cytochrome P450 inducers), smoking, alcohol, and dietary restriction (e.g., fasting, low carbohydrate intake). Manifestations of acute porphyria include abdominal pain (often severe), neurologic symptoms (e.g., peripheral neuropathy, psychiatric disturbances), and autonomic dysregulation (e.g., tachycardia, hypertension). The abdominal pain is thought to be due to porphyrin-induced autonomic neuropathy resulting in intestinal dysmotility.

Options B, C, D and E are incorrect because these compounds are not the ones that accumulate due to the enzyme defect in acute intermittent porphyria. Instead, it is aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen that accumulate and cause the symptoms of this condition."
89,"This patient's skin symptoms (ie, flushing, itching) are most likely secondary to niacin, which can cause cutaneous flushing and pruritus. These symptoms are mediated by prostaglandins and usually occur 1-4 hours after ingestion. The flushing is often generalized but can be more pronounced on the face, neck, and chest. It can be minimized by taking the drug with meals, avoiding alcohol or hot beverages near the time of ingestion, and taking aspirin or other NSAIDs 30 minutes before niacin to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. However, the symptoms are unpleasant and can lead to noncompliance. If preventive measures are not successful, it may be necessary to discontinue the niacin. Because this patient is statin intolerant and has continued hyperlipidemia, she should be switched to a different class of lipid-lowering agents. Fenofibrate, a fibric acid derivative, is most effective at lowering triglyceride levels but also moderately decreases total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.

The patient's itching and skin redness are likely due to niacin, which is known to cause these side effects. Niacin is a B-complex vitamin used to decrease serum cholesterol and triglycerides. The main side effects include cutaneous flushing and itching, which are mediated by prostaglandin-induced vasodilation. Symptoms are usually transient and most severe during initiation of therapy; they can be minimized by taking the drug with meals, by gradual dose escalation, and by taking 325 mg of aspirin 30 minutes prior to niacin administration. In addition, the extended-release formulation of niacin causes less flushing compared to the regular-release formulation. This patient's symptoms occur in the evening, suggesting they are related to her niacin dose. Given the severity of symptoms and their impact on her quality of life, a different lipid-lowering therapy should be considered.

Option B: Measure urine hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels - This test is used to detect serotonin-secreting tumors (eg, carcinoid syndrome), which can present with flushing. However, this patient's flushing has a clear temporal relationship to her niacin use and is not associated with diarrhea, which is commonly seen in carcinoid syndrome.

Option C: Measure urine metanephrine levels - This test is used to detect pheochromocytoma, a catecholamine-secreting tumor. Patients with this condition can present with flushing, but also typically have symptoms of catecholamine excess (eg, hypertension, headache, palpitations, sweating).

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's leg findings of bilateral 2+ pretibial edema can be explained by salt retention, but it's more likely that they're a result of renal protein loss. She has a known autoimmune condition (systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE), which can cause lupus nephritis, a kidney inflammation that can lead to proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome (which manifests as edema, particularly in the legs). The urinalysis results, which show proteinuria, red blood cell casts, and dysmorphic red blood cells, strongly suggest glomerulonephritis, a common complication of lupus nephritis. Glomerulonephritis can cause damage to the glomeruli, the small blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste and excess water from the blood to create urine. This can cause protein to leak from the blood into the urine (proteinuria), leading to a decrease in blood oncotic pressure and the development of edema due to the shift of fluid from the intravascular to the interstitial space.

Now let's look at the other options:

A) Venous insufficiency - Venous insufficiency could cause edema, but this patient's symptoms and lab findings are more consistent with nephritic syndrome.

B) Lymphatic obstruction - This would cause localized swelling (lymphedema), not the bilaterally symmetrical leg swelling seen in this patient.

C) Increased capillary permeability - This could cause edema, but it's more typically seen in conditions like sepsis or anaphylaxis, not in nephritic syndrome.

E) Salt retention - While salt retention can cause edema, it's more often associated with conditions like heart failure or liver disease. In this case, the patient's edema is more likely due to protein loss from the kidneys.

Firstly, this patient has a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA), as suggested by her decrease in bicarbonate (HCO3-) and low pH. The anion gap can be calculated with the formula (Na - Cl - HCO3). The normal anion gap is between 8-12. In this case, the anion gap is 35, which is significantly higher than normal. AGMA is commonly caused by DKA (Diabetic Ketoacidosis), alcohol, and renal failure. Given that the patient has type 1 diabetes, drank alcohol the night before, and has hyperglycemia, AGMA is most likely due to DKA.

Patients with DKA also often develop hyperkalemia due to acidosis. Acidemia leads to extracellular shift of potassium in exchange for H+ ions. However, total body potassium is usually decreased due to osmotic diuresis, but this patient's K is 5.6, suggesting total body hyperkalemia.

CT scan of the abdomen with contrast shows bilateral adrenal enlargement. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?""
Option: {'A': 'Adrenal infarction', 'B': 'Adrenal hemorrhage', 'C': 'Pituitary tumor', 'D': 'Infection with acid-fast bacilli', 'E': 'Autoimmune adrenalitis'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's bilateral adrenal enlargement, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and elevated ACTH level, coupled with her symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, loss of appetite, and decreased sensation in her feet, are suggestive of primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease). The most common cause of Addison disease in developed countries is autoimmune destruction of the adrenal gland (option E is correct). The patient's mother's history of systemic lupus erythematosus suggests that the patient may also have an underlying autoimmune condition. 

The other options can be ruled out as follows:

Option A and B, adrenal infarction and adrenal hemorrhage respectively, are unlikely as they tend to cause acute adrenal insufficiency and this patient's symptoms have been present for at least one month.

Option C, a pituitary tumor, may cause secondary adrenal insufficiency by decreasing ACTH production, but this patient's ACTH level is elevated.

Option D, infection with acid-fast bacilli, could result in adrenal insufficiency if the infection caused destruction of the adrenal glands (as in disseminated tuberculosis). However, this patient's symptoms and the bilateral adrenal enlargement visible on her CT scan are more suggestive of an autoimmune cause."
148,"The correct answer is 'C': 'Avoid sexual activity for the next month.'

Chlamydia trachomatis is a sexually transmitted infection, and patients diagnosed with this infection should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse for 7 days following single-dose therapy or until completion of a 7-day regimen. Partners also should be treated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends retesting all sexually active women younger than 25 years annually, as well as retesting patients of any age three months after treatment, regardless of partner treatment status, because of the high risk of reinfection.

Now let's look at the other options:

Option 'A': 'Avoid sun exposure' - This is incorrect. This recommendation is usually given with medications that increase the sensitivity of skin to sunlight, which is not the case for the antibiotics used to treat Chlamydia trachomatis.

Option 'B': 'Avoid drinking alcohol' - While this is generally a good health recommendation, it is not specifically related to the treatment of chlamydia. Unless the patient is being treated with a medication that interacts with alcohol, they would not necessarily need to avoid it.

Option 'D': 'Take medication with food' - This is incorrect because the absorption of the antibiotic (azithromycin or doxycycline) used for treatment of chlamydia is not significantly affected by food.

Option 'E': 'Schedule an ophthalmology consultation' - This would only be necessary if the patient was experiencing ocular symptoms indicative of trachoma or inclusion conjunctivitis, both of which can result from infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. Without these symptoms, there would be no need for an ophthalmology consultation.","stop","the correct answer is 'c': 'avoid sexual activity for the next month.'","C","A","USMLE question: Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) of first-void urine confirms infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. Treatment with the appropriate pharmacotherapy is started. Which of the following health maintenance recommendations is most appropriate at this time?
Option: {'A': 'Avoid sun exposure', 'B': 'Avoid drinking alcohol', 'C': 'Avoid sexual activity for the next month', 'D': 'Take medication with food', 'E': 'Schedule an ophthalmology consultation\n""'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The most appropriate health maintenance recommendation after starting treatment for Chlamydia trachomatis is C: Avoid sexual activity for the next month. 

Chlamydia trachomatis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). The primary mode of transmission is through sexual contact, hence, itâ??s crucial to avoid sexual activity until treatment is completed to prevent re-infection or transmission to partners. The recommended duration of abstinence from sexual activity is at least 7 days after a single-dose regimen or until completion of a 7-day regimen. However, advising to avoid sexual activity for the next month provides a margin of safety to reduce the risk of transmission.

As for the other options: 

Option A: Avoid sun exposure is not necessary. Photosensitivity is not a typical side effect of the antibiotics used to treat Chlamydia.

Option B: Avoid drinking alcohol. While it's generally a good idea to avoid alcohol when taking any medication, it's not specifically necessary for the antibiotics used to treat Chlamydia. However, alcohol can lower your immune response, so it's a good idea to limit intake when fighting an infection.

Option D: Take medication with food. This can help reduce stomach upset for some antibiotics, but it's not a strict requirement for the medications used to treat Chlamydia. 

Option E: Schedule an ophthalmology consultation. This may be appropriate if the chlamydia infection has spread to the eyes (in the form of trachoma), which is not the standard presentation and is more common in developing countries. However, there's no indication in the question that this patient has ocular involvement."
158,"The correct answer is E: Decreased folate concentration. 

This patient's history of recent travel and leg swelling, warmth, and tenderness is suggestive of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), a common complication of long-distance travel due to immobilization and dehydration. Hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for both venous and arterial thrombosis, as it can cause endothelial damage and promote thrombus formation. Causes of hyperhomocysteinemia include deficiency of the vitamin cofactors required for homocysteine metabolism (eg, folate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12) and genetic abnormalities (eg, cystathionine Î²-synthase deficiency, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase [MTHFR] mutation). 

In this patient, the normal methylmalonic acid concentration argues against vitamin B12 deficiency, which causes increased homocysteine and methylmalonic acid concentrations. Therefore, the most likely cause of her hyperhomocysteinemia is folate deficiency due to her alcohol use disorder. Chronic alcohol use is a common cause of folate deficiency, as it results in poor dietary intake, decreased absorption, and increased urinary excretion of folate. 

The other options are incorrect:

A: Increased pyridoxine (vitamin B6) concentration is not likely because vitamin B6 deficiency, not excess, causes hyperhomocysteinemia.

B: Increased fibrinogen concentration is a nonspecific acute-phase reactant and may be elevated in DVT but does not cause hyperhomocysteinemia.

C: Decreased cobalamin (vitamin B12) concentration causes increased homocysteine and methylmalonic acid concentrations; however, her methylmalonic acid concentration is normal.

D: Decreased protein C concentration can cause hypercoagulability and DVT but does not cause hyperhomocysteinemia.","stop","the correct answer is e: decreased folate concentration.","E","E","USMLE question: A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-day history of swelling and pain in the left leg. Two days ago, she returned from a business trip on a long-distance flight. She has alcohol use disorder. Physical examination shows a tender, swollen, and warm left calf. Serum studies show an increased homocysteine concentration and a methylmalonic acid concentration within the reference range. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following serum findings?
Option: {'A': 'Increased pyridoxine concentration', 'B': 'Increased fibrinogen concentration', 'C': 'Decreased cobalamin concentration', 'D': 'Decreased protein C concentration', 'E': 'Decreased folate concentration'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's history of recent long-distance travel, alcohol use disorder, and clinical presentation of a swollen, tender leg are suggestive of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Her elevated homocysteine level is also indicative of a hypercoagulable state and could be responsible for her DVT. Homocysteine is an amino acid that, when elevated, is associated with endothelial damage and promotion of thrombosis. Three vitamins are involved in homocysteine metabolism: folate, cobalamin (vitamin B12), and pyridoxine (vitamin B6). 

Deficiency of any of these vitamins can result in elevated homocysteine levels, with the potential to cause thrombosis. However, only cobalamin deficiency is associated with normal methylmalonic acid levels, which is observed in this patient. Therefore, option 'C': Decreased cobalamin concentration is the most likely finding in this patient.

Now, let's discuss why the other options are wrong:

- 'A': Increased pyridoxine concentration: An increase in vitamin B6 levels would likely reduce homocysteine levels, not increase them. Furthermore, there is no clear connection between this condition and the patient's leg symptoms or history.
- 'B': Increased fibrinogen concentration: Although fibrinogen is involved in clotting, an increase would not specifically cause the symptoms seen in this patient. Fibrinogen levels can become elevated in any inflammatory state, not only in DVT.
- 'D': Decreased protein C concentration: Although a deficiency in protein C could potentially increase the risk of DVT, it would not explain the patient's elevated homocysteine levels.
- 'E': Decreased folate concentration: Folate deficiency can indeed cause elevated homocysteine levels, but it also usually causes an increase in methylmalonic acid levels, which is not observed in this patient. This makes cobalamin deficiency a more likely cause of the patient's elevated homocysteine levels."
167,"This patient's episodic headaches, palpitations, sweating, and hypertension suggest a pheochromocytoma, a catecholamine-secreting tumor typically found in the adrenal medulla. Catecholamines (norepinephrine and epinephrine) are released into the circulation, leading to symptoms such as those in this patient. Catecholamines exert their effects by binding to adrenergic receptors, leading to activation of adenylyl cyclase and increased production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP acts as a second messenger to activate protein kinase A, which phosphorylates L-type calcium channels. These channels are responsible for the slow inward current that sustains depolarization in cardiac myocytes, leading to an increased rate of contraction (increased heart rate) and strength of contraction (increased stroke volume). Therefore, the answer is B: L-type calcium channels.

Option A: Hyperpolarization-activated, nucleotide-gated channels are responsible for generating pacemaker currents in cardiac cells, but catecholamines do not act primarily by altering the activity of these channels.
Option C: T-type calcium channels contribute to pacemaker activity and conduction in the heart, but their role is less significant than that of L-type channels, and they are not the primary target of catecholamines.
Option D: Voltage-gated sodium channels are important for action potential initiation and propagation, but are not the primary site of action of catecholamines.
Option E: Voltage-gated potassium channels contribute to repolarization of the cardiac action potential, but are not the primary site of action of catecholamines.","stop","therefore, the answer is b: l-type calcium channels.","B","A","USMLE question: A 42-year-old male presents to the emergency department due to severe headaches and palpitations.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The patient's symptoms of severe headache, palpitations, sweating, and markedly elevated blood pressure in conjunction with a retroperitoneal mass are characteristic of a pheochromocytoma. This is a tumor of the adrenal medulla that secretes excessive amounts of catecholamines, including norepinephrine and epinephrine. In the heart, catecholamines bind to beta-1 adrenergic receptors, activating adenylyl cyclase and increasing cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. This, in turn, enhances the activity of L-type calcium channels (option B). Increased influx of calcium into cardiac cells augments cardiac contractility and heart rate (positive inotropy and chronotropy). 

Option A, hyperpolarization-activated, nucleotide-gated channels, are important in controlling the rhythmic activity of the heart and are not affected by catecholamines. 

Option C, T-type calcium channels, are found in tissues such as the brain and kidney but do not play a major role in the heart. 

Option D, voltage-gated sodium channels, are important in initiating the action potential in cardiac cells, but their activity is not significantly affected by catecholamines.

170,"This patient's prolonged sleep latency, frequent awakenings, and associated daytime fatigue are consistent with chronic insomnia. Chronic insomnia is defined as difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or early morning awakenings for at least 3 nights per week for at least 3 months. It is often comorbid with mental health disorders, medical illness, or substance use. However, idiopathic chronic insomnia can also occur in older patients as part of the normal aging process. In such cases, the patient often has unrealistic sleep requirements and excessive worry about the perceived consequences of insomnia, thereby worsening the symptoms.
Sleep hygiene education should be the initial intervention for patients with chronic insomnia. This includes regular exercise; avoidance of caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol; a quiet sleep environment; and a regular sleep schedule.
Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia. It includes components of sleep restriction, stimulus control, and cognitive therapy. Sleep restriction (choice A), for example, initially limits the amount of time spent in bed to the actual amount of time slept, thereby increasing sleep efficiency (ie, time spent in bed asleep). The amount of time in bed is then gradually increased.

The other options are not correct:

- Benzodiazepines (eg, flurazepam, choice B) are not recommended for chronic insomnia due to risks of tolerance, dependence, and side effects (eg, cognitive impairment, falls).
- Reassurance (choice C) alone is not adequate for a patient with a sleep disorder that is clearly affecting her quality of life.
- Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP, choice D) is indicated for obstructive sleep apnea, but this patient has no snoring or witnessed apneas.
- Paradoxical intention (choice E) is a CBT-I technique that involves instructing the patient to engage in the behavior that is the object of anxiety (eg, staying awake), thus removing the performance anxiety that perpetuates the insomnia. It is typically used for patients with sleep-onset insomnia due to excessive worry about falling asleep. This patient's problem is sleep maintenance, not sleep onset.

The patient's clinical presentation and the presence of non-lactose fermenting, Gram-negative rods suggest a diagnosis of Shigellosis, a bacterial infection caused by Shigella species. Shigella dysenteriae, one of the species, produces a toxin known as Shiga toxin. This toxin's A subunit acts to ADP-ribosylate the Gs protein of the host cells.

Option 'A' is incorrect because Shiga toxin does not inhibit the 60S ribosome. Rather, it is diphtheria toxin and certain types of Shiga-like toxin from E.coli that inhibit protein synthesis by acting on the 60S ribosome.

Option 'B' is incorrect because bacterial toxins do not typically lyse red blood cells. Hemolysins, which are produced by some bacterial species like Staphylococcus, are capable of lysing red blood cells, but this is not the case with Shigella.

Option 'C' is incorrect because Shiga toxin does not prevent phagocytosis. Some bacteria, like Yersinia and Salmonella, have mechanisms to prevent or survive phagocytosis, but not Shigella.

Option 'D' is incorrect because the inhibition of exocytosis of ACh from synaptic terminals is the mechanism of action of Clostridium botulinum toxin, not Shigella.

Once sensitized, subsequent exposure to the same antigen can trigger an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction. 

The resulting hemolysis can lead to acute kidney injury due to the deposition of free hemoglobin in the renal tubules, leading to tubular obstruction and direct tubular toxicity. Hemoglobinuria can lead to the production of dark or ""cola""-colored urine. Additionally, fever and tachycardia can occur due to systemic inflammation and the release of pyrogens.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

A: Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray would be seen in acute chest syndrome or transfusion-related acute lung injury, not in a hemolytic transfusion reaction.

C: A positive direct Coombs test would indicate autoimmune hemolytic anemia, not a hemolytic transfusion reaction.

D: Positive blood cultures would suggest a septic transfusion reaction, which presents with high fever, rigors, and hypotension within minutes to hours after transfusion.

E: Low levels of serum IgA immunoglobulins would be seen in patients with selective IgA deficiency, which can lead to anti-IgA antibodies and transfusion reactions in rare cases.

This patient's acute flank pain and dark brown urine after transfusion are suggestive of acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR), a type I hypersensitivity reaction. AHTR is most commonly due to ABO incompatibility, but as this patient had multiple past transfusions, the presence of antibodies against other antigens such as those in the Rh or other blood group systems or against class I HLA antigens should be considered. Fever and flank pain due to renal ischemia from pigment nephropathy are the most common clinical manifestations of AHTR. Hemoglobinemia can occur and may manifest as dark-brown urine (from hemoglobinuria). 

Option A,'Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray', would suggest acute chest syndrome or transfusion-related acute lung injury. These conditions would typically present with hypoxia and respiratory distress which are not mentioned in the patient's presentation. 

Option C, 'Positive direct Coombs test', would suggest an autoimmune hemolytic anemia rather than a transfusion reaction. 

Option D, 'Positive blood cultures', would suggest a septic reaction. Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection is typically due to contaminated platelet units and would usually cause hypotension and shock.

Option E, 'Low levels of serum IgA immunoglobulins', would suggest an IgA deficiency â?? an IgA-deficient patient with anti-IgA antibodies who receives blood products containing IgA may have an anaphylactic transfusion reaction. However, the patient's presentation doesn't suggest anaphylaxis."

282,"The correct answer is 'C': Purkinje fibers > ventricles > atria > AV node.

Explanation:
The conduction system of the heart refers to the group of specialized cardiac muscle cells that are involved in the propagation of electrical impulses through the heart, which result in contraction of the heart muscle.

The Purkinje fibers have the fastest conduction velocity in the heart, which allows for the almost simultaneous contraction of the entire ventricular myocardium. The ventricles and atria have a similar conduction velocity but slightly slower than the Purkinje fibers. The slowest conduction velocity is in the AV node, which allows for the delay between atrial and ventricular contraction to ensure efficient blood flow.

The other options are incorrect:
- 'A': Atria > Purkinje fibers > ventricles > AV node. This is wrong because the Purkinje fibers have a faster conduction velocity than the atria.
- 'B': AV node > ventricles > atria > Purkinje fibers. This is wrong because the AV node has the slowest conduction velocity in the heart, not the fastest.
- 'D': Purkinje fibers > atria > ventricles > AV node. This is wrong because the conduction velocity in the atria is not faster than in the ventricles.

Purkinje fibers have the fastest conduction velocity as they are responsible for the rapid spread of the signal throughout the ventricles. The ventricles and atria have similar conduction speeds, but it is slightly faster in the ventricles due to the presence of the Purkinje fibers. The AV node has the slowest conduction velocity which is important because it provides a delay in the signal transmission from the atria to the ventricles, allowing the atria time to contract and complete the filling of the ventricles before the ventricles contract.

315,"This patient's symptoms of flushing, diarrhea, wheezing, and right-sided valvular disease (tricuspid regurgitation) in the context of increased urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) are suggestive of carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid syndrome occurs due to secretion of vasoactive substances (eg, serotonin, bradykinin, tachykinins) by carcinoid tumors, which are neuroendocrine tumors most commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract. Right-sided valvular heart disease (eg, tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary stenosis) can be seen in carcinoid syndrome due to the paraneoplastic effects of the vasoactive substances on the endocardium. Left-sided valvular lesions are rare because monoamine oxidase in the lung metabolizes the serotonin before it reaches the left side of the heart. However, in the case of hepatic metastases, the vasoactive substances can bypass the inactivation mechanism in the lungs via the systemic circulation and cause left-sided valvular lesions, as seen in this patient. Therefore, this patient is most likely to have a gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor with hepatic metastasis (Choice E).

A tumor in the pancreas without metastasis (Choice A) is unlikely as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors often present with symptoms of hormone hypersecretion (eg, insulin, gastrin, glucagon) rather than those of carcinoid syndrome.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of carcinoid syndrome, which is characterized by flushing, diarrhea, bronchospasm, and right-sided valvular heart disease. Carcinoid syndrome is caused by carcinoid tumors, which are neuroendocrine tumors that most commonly originate in the gastrointestinal tract (especially the appendix) or the lungs. They secrete serotonin, kallikrein, and other vasoactive substances. The classic symptoms of carcinoid syndrome, such as those experienced by this patient, are thought to be due to the release of these substances into the systemic circulation.

The ""carcinoid heart disease"" seen in these patients typically involves the right side of the heart because monoamine oxidase in the lungs metabolizes the vasoactive substances before they reach the left side of the heart. However, in patients with lung carcinoids or with carcinoids that have metastasized to the liver (which would allow the substances to bypass metabolism in the liver and lungs), left-sided heart involvement may occur. This patient's left-sided heart disease and increased urinary 5-HIAA (a metabolite of serotonin) are therefore most suggestive of a tumor with hepatic metastasis.

Based on all of this information, the correct answer is likely ""E: Tumor in the descending colon with hepatic metastasis"". 

The other options are less likely for the following reasons:

A: Pancreatic tumors do not typically secrete serotonin and other vasoactive substances, so they would not cause carcinoid syndrome.

C: There is no reason to suspect a tumor in the left atrium based on this patient's symptoms and test results.
D: While appendiceal carcinoids are common, the lack of hepatic metastasis would not explain the left-sided heart disease in this patient. It is also less likely to present with significant symptoms as it is usually an incidental finding on appendectomy due to its small size."
318,"The correct answer is C. Glucose

This patient's presentation of vomiting, lethargy, abnormal movements (likely seizures), and a sweet-smelling breath (due to the presence of ketones) suggest a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is a life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) that occurs when insulin levels are insufficient to meet the body's basic metabolic requirements. In this state, glucose cannot be utilized for energy, resulting in increased breakdown of fatty acids for energy and subsequent ketone body production. The ensuing metabolic acidosis is compensated for by a respiratory alkalosis, manifesting as Kussmaul respirations (deep, labored breathing).

This patient's presentation of vomiting, lethargy, abnormal movements, and a sweet smell to his breath is suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Infants of mothers with poorly managed diabetes during pregnancy are at an increased risk of developing diabetes themselves. In DKA, the body's cells are not able to take up glucose due to a lack of insulin, resulting in hyperglycemia. The body then uses fat as an alternate energy source, leading to the production of ketones. One of the ketones, acetone, has a fruity or sweet smell and can be detected in a patient's breath. The other symptoms present in this case, such as changes to the central nervous system (lethargy and abnormal movements), can be attributed to the metabolic acidosis caused by the elevated levels of ketones.

Given his recent medication change, the new symptoms of pancytopenia (anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia) are likely due to methotrexate toxicity. Methotrexate is a folate antimetabolite and is commonly used in patients with RA who do not respond to first-line therapies (eg, NSAIDs, prednisone, hydroxychloroquine). Toxicity can lead to megaloblastic anemia and pancytopenia due to bone marrow suppression.

This patient's chronic joint pain and stiffness along with subcutaneous nodules and boutonniÃ¨re deformity suggest a long-standing history of rheumatoid arthritis. Methotrexate is the first-line treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, with a side effect profile including myelosuppression, which can present as anemia, leukopenia, and/or thrombocytopenia, as seen in this patient. Methotrexate is a folate antimetabolite that inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, a critical enzyme in the pathway responsible for nucleotide synthesis. The resulting accumulation of dihydrofolate is toxic to rapidly dividing cells, such as those in the bone marrow, leading to myelosuppression. Amifostine is a cytoprotective adjuvant often given with chemotherapeutic agents to reduce their toxic effects on normal cells. Its preferential uptake by normal cells allows for inactivation of harmful metabolites or reactive oxygen species produced by the chemotherapeutic agents. In this patient, amifostine could have helped prevent the myelosuppression caused by methotrexate.

Central nervous system involvement results in seizures and cognitive impairment, the severity of which can range from mild learning disabilities to severe intellectual disability. Ophthalmologic findings include retinal hamartomas and iris ""leaf"" nodules. Cardiac rhabdomyomas, although often asymptomatic, are seen in up to half of TSC patients and are especially common in neonates and infants.

Patients with TSC are also at increased risk for renal angiomyolipomas and pulmonary lymphangiomyomatosis. These benign renal tumors can cause pain, hematuria, and, rarely, renal failure. Pulmonary lymphangiomyomatosis, which typically presents with dyspnea and recurrent pneumothorax in women of childbearing age, can also cause chylous effusions and hemoptysis.

337,"The most likely explanation for this patient's presentation is 'E: Sub-therapeutic dose'. The abnormal movements, lack of response, and persistence of symptoms despite treatment with diazepam suggest that his original seizure was not successfully controlled. Carpopedal spasm is a classic sign of hypocalcemia, which can occur with inadequate treatment of seizures due to decreased intestinal absorption of calcium or increased renal excretion.

Option 'A: Acute renal failure' is unlikely as there are no signs or symptoms of kidney disease in this patient. 

Option 'B: Elevated blood levels of a medication' is not likely the cause of his symptoms. While certain medications can cause seizures, the patient's symptoms of carpopedal spasm suggest a metabolic cause such as hypocalcemia, not medication toxicity.

Option 'C: Increased water consumption' could potentially lead to hyponatremia and seizures, but this patient's presentation is more consistent with hypocalcemia, not hyponatremia.

Option 'D: P450 induction' refers to a process where certain medications can increase the production of cytochrome P450 enzymes, which can metabolize other drugs more quickly and potentially decrease their effectiveness.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient presents with an acute history of collapse, altered level of consciousness, tachycardia, hyperthermia, and rhabdomyolysis (evidenced by markedly elevated creatine kinase and dark brown urine consistent with myoglobinuria). This clinical scenario is consistent with heat stroke, a life-threatening condition characterized by an elevated core body temperature that leads to central nervous system dysfunction. It often occurs in individuals exposed to hot environments.

Heat stroke can be due to either classic (due to environmental exposure in very young or old individuals, or those with chronic disease) or exertional (typically affects healthy, young individuals exercising in hot environments) forms. It is a medical emergency and, once diagnosed, efforts must be made to decrease the patient's core body temperature as quickly as possible. 

Evaporative cooling (Option C) is the most effective method for rapid cooling and is therefore the most appropriate next step in management. This involves spraying the patient with warm water while fans are used to circulate air. The water on the skin surface evaporates, removing heat and thereby cooling the patient. 

Ice water immersion (Option D) could theoretically provide faster cooling compared to evaporative cooling. However, it may cause cutaneous vasoconstriction, thereby diminishing heat loss. It also may lead to shivering, which can increase the body's heat production. 

Although both dantrolene (Option B) and acetaminophen (Option A) can reduce fever, they are not useful in heat stroke because the problem in heat stroke is not an altered hypothalamic set point (as is the case in fever), but rather an inability to eliminate heat due to environmental or physical conditions. 

Finally, hemodialysis (Option E) is not routinely indicated in the initial management of heat stroke. However, it may be necessary in the context of acute kidney injury secondary to rhabdomyolysis, if it does not respond to aggressive fluid resuscitation."

The ultrasound findings of proportionally reduced head circumference, trunk size, and limb length further support the diagnosis of symmetric (or primary) intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). In symmetric IUGR, both the head and body are small, which suggests an early insult affecting all germ layers. The most common causes of symmetric IUGR are chromosomal abnormalities and severe maternal disease states such as preexisting diabetes.

368,"The correct answer is 'D': Breast implants.

While there is ongoing debate regarding the relationship between breast implants and breast cancer, some studies suggest that breast implants may delay the detection of breast cancer due to difficulty visualizing the breast tissue on mammography. This could potentially lead to a more advanced stage at diagnosis. It's important to note that having breast implants does not directly cause breast cancer, but it may make it more difficult to detect early signs of the disease.

Let's consider why the other options are wrong:

A) Sedentarism - While a lack of physical activity can contribute to an increased risk of various types of cancer, it is not considered a significant risk factor for breast cancer.

B) Breastfeeding - Actually, breastfeeding is associated with a slightly reduced risk of breast cancer, especially if it is continued for 1.5 to 2 years. Therefore, this is not a risk factor in this case.

C) Mediterranean diet - This diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, olive oil, and lean proteins, is generally associated with lower risks of many types of cancer, including breast cancer. It's not a risk factor but a protective one.

E) Occupation - Being a flight attendant has been associated with a slightly increased risk of breast cancer due to potential exposure to cosmic ionizing radiation.

The other options are not significant risk factors for breast cancer:

A: Sedentarism - While a lack of physical activity can contribute to a higher body weight, which could possibly increase the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer, it is not as significant as the risk associated with breast implants.

380,"The correct answer is E. Phototherapy.

This neonate with breast milk jaundice (indirect hyperbilirubinemia) is moderately dehydrated, as evidenced by a 14% weight loss from birth and dry mucous membranes. Dehydration can contribute to the development of jaundice in the first week of life by two mechanisms. First, breastfed infants may have a higher bilirubin load due to an increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. Second, inadequate intake (dehydration) leads to decreased stooling and increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. In this patient, breastfeeding should be supplemented with expressed breast milk or formula to promote hydration and stooling. However, the bilirubin level is already sufficiently high to warrant phototherapy (option E). Phototherapy should be initiated in neonates with total serum bilirubin levels that meet or exceed levels recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. 

Option A (Intravenous immunoglobulin) is incorrect as it is used in the treatment of hemolytic disease of the newborn, which is not suggested by the patient's findings.

This infant's jaundice, with a total bilirubin level of 9 mg/dL, and weight loss of >10% of birth weight with a high pulse rate and dry mucous membranes suggests dehydration due to inadequate breast milk intake, also known as breastfeeding jaundice. When breastfeeding is not going well (due to poor latch, infrequent feedings, or other issues), an infant may not get enough milk. This can lead to mild dehydration, which increases enterohepatic circulation and leads to an increase in unconjugated bilirubin, thereby causing jaundice. 

Phototherapy is used to decrease total serum bilirubin levels as it converts unconjugated bilirubin into a water-soluble form that can be excreted in the urine and bile without undergoing glucuronidation in the liver. 

Option A: Intravenous immunoglobulin is used for Rh or ABO incompatibility with significant hemolysis, which is not the case here.

Option B: Phenobarbital increases the solubility of the bilirubin and is used in Crigler-Najjar syndrome and some other specific conditions, not in breastfeeding jaundice.

Option C: Increasing frequency of breastfeeding is a good approach for correcting the inadequate milk intake and dehydration, but it may not be enough to decrease the elevated bilirubin levels rapidly. 

Option D: Abdominal sonography would be appropriate if there was a suspicion of biliary atresia or another anatomical liver problem, which is not suggested by the history or lab results. 

In summary, the first priority is to decrease the high bilirubin levels to prevent kernicterus, which is achieved most promptly by phototherapy. At the same time, lactation consultation to improve breastfeeding and hydration should be initiated."

406,"The correct answer is A: CT angiography.

The patient in the vignette has chronic dyspnea, digital clubbing, clear lung examination, prominent jugular venous pulsations (indicative of right-sided heart failure), loud, split S2 (indicative of pulmonary hypertension), and peripheral edema. These findings suggest chronic pulmonary disease leading to cor pulmonale (right-sided heart failure due to pulmonary disease). One of the most common causes of such a presentation in a smoker is chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Patients with CTEPH often present with unexplained dyspnea following an acute pulmonary embolism, but the condition can also occur without a clear history of venous thromboembolism. Risk factors include prior venous thromboembolism, malignancy, splenectomy, and autoimmune disease.

CTEPH is diagnosed by ventilation/perfusion lung scan, which shows multiple mismatched defects. However, the gold standard diagnostic test is pulmonary angiography (option A), which directly visualizes the pulmonary vasculature. 

As to why the other options are incorrect:

Option B: Doppler echocardiography is useful for estimating pulmonary artery pressure and assessing right heart function, but it does not directly visualize the pulmonary vasculature to confirm the presence of chronic thromboembolic disease.

Five years ago, she emigrated from Eastern Europe. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years. She has a history of using methamphetamines and cocaine but quit 5 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows jugular venous pulsations 9 cm above the sternal angle. The lungs are clear to auscultation. There is a normal S1 and a loud, split S2. An impulse can be felt with the fingers left of the sternum. The abdomen is soft and nontender. The fingertips are enlarged and the nails are curved. There is pitting edema around the ankles bilaterally. An x-ray of the chest shows pronounced central pulmonary arteries and a prominent right heart border. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?
Option: {'A': 'CT angiography', 'B': 'Doppler echocardiography', 'C': 'High-resolution CT of the lung', 'D': 'Right-heart catheterization', 'E': 'Serologic testing'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The patient in this vignette has symptoms and signs of chronic pulmonary hypertension (eg, dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, loud S2, right ventricular lift, jugular venous distention, peripheral edema). Chronic pulmonary hypertension can lead to right-sided heart failure, or cor pulmonale. The most common cause of pulmonary hypertension worldwide, including in Eastern Europe, is chronic thromboembolic disease. Other findings suggestive of her diagnosis include prominent central pulmonary arteries (""pruning"") and right heart border (enlarged right atrium) on chest x-ray. Clubbing, as seen in this patient, may occur in chronic hypoxemic conditions.

Right-heart catheterization (Option D) is the gold standard for diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension because it allows for direct measurement of right atrial pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and cardiac output. However, CT angiography (Option A) is the best initial test for suspected chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension because it can directly visualize filling defects in the pulmonary vasculature. 

Echocardiography (Option B) can estimate pulmonary artery pressure and assess right ventricular size and function, but it is less accurate and does not allow for evaluation of the pulmonary vasculature for potential treatable causes (eg, thromboembolic disease). High-resolution CT (Option C) is best for evaluating interstitial lung disease, which does not appear to be the issue in this patient. Serologic testing (Option E) may be helpful in patients with suspected connective tissue disease but would not confirm the diagnosis in this patient with likely chronic thromboembolic disease. 

Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: CT angiography."
427,"The woman's symptoms suggest that she is suffering from a disulfiram-like reaction caused by the interaction of alcohol with her new medication. This is a known side effect of certain oral hypoglycemic agents, specifically first-generation sulfonylureas, such as tolbutamide and chlorpropamide. These medications work by closing potassium channels in the beta cells of the pancreas. This leads to depolarization of the cell membrane, which in turn stimulates insulin release by allowing an influx of calcium ions. Therefore, the correct answer is option B.

Option A, binding to peroxisome proliferator-activating receptors, is the mechanism of action of thiazolidinediones, which do not cause a disulfiram-like reaction.

Option C, decreasing hepatic gluconeogenesis, is the mechanism of action of metformin. While it can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, it does not lead to a disulfiram-like reaction.

Option D, inhibiting alpha-glucosidase, is the mechanism of action of acarbose and miglitol. These drugs can cause gastrointestinal symptoms but not a disulfiram-like reaction.

437,"The most likely diagnosis in this patient is 'E': Lipohyalinosis.

The patient's sudden-onset, unilateral weakness suggests an acute stroke. In patients with hypertension, small penetrating arteries can undergo lipohyalinosis, a process characterized by hyaline degeneration and fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel wall, and development of microaneurysms. These weakened vessels can rupture, leading to a small deep brain (lacunar) infarct.

Option A, 'Berry aneurysm rupture', is incorrect. Berry aneurysms typically present with a sudden, severe headache, often described as ""the worst headache of my life,"" and are associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage. This patient does not have these symptoms.

Option B, 'Bridging vein tear', is incorrect. A bridging vein tear would be more likely in a patient with a history of trauma, which this patient denies. This injury results in a subdural hematoma, which would present with fluctuating levels of consciousness, headache, and neurological symptoms that slowly progress over days to weeks.

Option C, 'Cerebellar bleeding', is incorrect. This would likely present with vertigo, nystagmus, nausea, and/or vomiting. The cerebellum controls balance and coordination, and injury here would affect these functions. The patient's symptoms are more localized to the arm, suggesting a different location of injury.

Option D, 'Hypertensive encephalopathy', is incorrect. Hypertensive encephalopathy is a condition caused by very high blood pressure, leading to brain swelling. Symptoms can include headache, nausea/vomiting, seizures, altered mental status, and visual disturbances.

The patient states that he was at home enjoying his morning coffee when his symptoms began. He says that his left arm suddenly felt very odd and weak thus prompting him to come to the ED. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, COPD, hypertension, anxiety, alcohol abuse, and PTSD. He recently fell off a horse while horseback riding but claims to not have experienced any significant injuries. He typically drinks 5-7 drinks per day and his last drink was yesterday afternoon. His current medications include insulin, metformin, atorvastatin, lisinopril, albuterol, and fluoxetine. His temperature is 99.5Ã?Â°F (37.5Ã?Â°C), blood pressure is 177/118 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 93% on room air. On physical exam, you note an elderly man who is mildly confused. Cardiopulmonary exam demonstrates bilateral expiratory wheezes and a systolic murmur along the right upper sternal border that radiates to the carotids. Neurological exam reveals cranial nerves II-XII as grossly intact with finger-nose exam mildly abnormal on the left and heel-shin exam within normal limits. The patient has 5/5 strength in his right arm and 3/5 strength in his left arm. The patient struggles to manipulate objects such as a pen with his left hand. The patient is given a dose of diazepam and started on IV fluids. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The most likely diagnosis in this patient is hypertensive encephalopathy (option D). The patient's history of long-standing hypertension is likely the cause of his current presentation. Hypertensive encephalopathy is a condition characterized by sudden, severe elevation in blood pressure that is often accompanied by confusion, visual disturbances, and neurologic findings such as hemiparesis, similar to what is seen in this patient. An elevated blood pressure, such as the one this patient has (177/118 mmHg), can lead to dysfunction of the autoregulatory mechanism in the brain, which in turn can cause cerebral edema and the symptoms of hypertensive encephalopathy.

As for the other options:

Option A, Berry aneurysm rupture, would likely present with a sudden, severe headache (often described as a ""thunderclap"" headache), and may be associated with a decreased level of consciousness or other signs of increased intracranial pressure. This patient does not have a headache and his level of consciousness is only mildly decreased.

Option B, Bridging vein tear, is associated with traumatic head injuries and can lead to a subdural hematoma. This usually presents with headache, confusion, drowsiness, and other neurological symptoms. However, the patient's recent fall from a horse did not result in any significant head trauma according to his report.

Option C, Cerebellar bleeding, could indeed cause weakness and abnormal neurologic exams, but it would typically also cause severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and problems with balance and coordination, which this patient does not have.

Option E, Lipohyalinosis, is a process that affects small penetrating arteries in the brain, often leading to lacunar infarcts. While this patient does have risk factors for lipohyalinosis (hypertension, diabetes), his presentation is more suggestive of hypertensive encephalopathy."
440,"The correct answer is A: Increase respiratory rate.

This patient's altered mental status, abdominal pain, and hyperglycemia (glucose >200 mg/dL), in addition to an arterial pH <7.3, are suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). His polyuria and polydipsia likely led to volume depletion (as suggested by his hypotension and tachycardia), hemoconcentration (elevated BUN), and prerenal azotemia (elevated creatinine). DKA is a medical emergency that, left untreated, leads to coma and death.

The primary treatment for DKA includes insulin and isotonic saline. Insulin halts ketogenesis, decreases glucose production, and promotes the uptake of glucose into cells. Isotonic saline helps correct the severe volume depletion that is common in DKA. This patient's severe metabolic acidosis (bicarbonate <5 mEq/L) led to respiratory compensation (ie, tachypnea) to increase the elimination of carbon dioxide, a volatile acid. However, as the patient became fatigued, he was intubated to control his airway and optimize his ventilation. 

After intubation, the patient's blood gas results revealed a normal partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2), suggesting inadequate ventilation for his degree of metabolic acidosis. An increased respiratory rate will allow for increased elimination of carbon dioxide and a subsequent decrease in PaCO2, which will help to correct the patient's acidemia. 

The other options are incorrect because increasing the tidal volume (option C) or positive end-expiratory pressure (option E), or both (option D), will not effectively decrease PaCO2. Increasing both the respiratory rate and tidal volume (option B) could potentially lead to barotrauma.","stop","the correct answer is a: increase respiratory rate.","A","B","USMLE question: A 14-year-old male presents to the emergency department with altered mental status.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's biochemical profile is consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) (eg, markedly elevated blood glucose, low bicarbonate, elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis). In DKA, the body shifts to using ketone bodies for energy, which results in ketosis and a high anion gap metabolic acidosis. The rate of ketone body formation exceeds the body's ability to metabolize them, leading to their accumulation in the blood. The resulting ketoacidosis can be partially compensated by hyperventilation (ie, Kussmaul breathing), which decreases the PCO2 and increases the pH. However, this patient required intubation for altered mental status and is now hypoventilating on the ventilator (as indicated by a normal PCO2), worsening his acidosis. As a result, the best next step in management would be to increase his respiratory rate on the ventilator to decrease the PCO2 and increase the pH (option A).

Option B: Increasing the tidal volume would also decrease the PCO2 and increase the pH. However, it can also increase the risk of barotrauma by causing overdistention of the alveoli. Therefore, while the tidal volume can be adjusted to alter the PCO2, changes in the respiratory rate are safer and are the preferred initial method of adjusting the PCO2.

Option C: For the same reasons mentioned above, this option is incorrect.

Option D: Increasing the PEEP can improve oxygenation by recruiting collapsed alveoli, but it would not address this patient's primary issue, which is acidosis from hypoventilation.

Option E: PEEP does not improve ventilation (ie, CO2 elimination) and would not correct this patient's acidosis. It is primarily used to improve oxygenation."

Glucagonomas classically present with a syndrome of necrolytic migratory erythema (NME), diabetes mellitus, weight loss, and anemia. NME is characterized by the episodic eruption of erythematous, bullous, or ulcerative skin lesions which migrate and heal spontaneously only to erupt in another location. Other symptoms include glossitis, cheilosis, and diarrhea. The diabetes associated with glucagonoma is often mild and the patient may not have a known history of diabetes. 

Octreotide, a somatostatin analog, can provide symptomatic relief by suppressing the secretion of various hormones, including glucagon. It is also the primary medical treatment for these patients.

Option A (Measurement of serum zinc levels) is not appropriate because zinc deficiency can cause acrodermatitis enteropathica, which can also present with dermatitis, diarrhea, and alopecia, but is not associated with diabetes or pancreatic tumors.

Option B (Endoscopic ultrasonography) would be useful for biopsy of a pancreatic mass but is not the first step in the management of glucagonoma.

450,"This patient's persistent amenorrhea, inability to breastfeed, fatigue, weight gain, and intolerance to cold are symptoms of postpartum hypopituitarism, also known as Sheehan syndrome.

Early manifestations include failure to lactate and loss of pubic and axillary hair. Later manifestations include symptoms of hypothyroidism (e.g., fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain), adrenal insufficiency (e.g., fatigue, hypotension), and loss of other anterior pituitary hormones.

The pituitary gland secretes several hormones, including prolactin (needed for lactation), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (needed for menstruation and fertility), thyroid-stimulating hormone (stimulates the thyroid to produce thyroid hormones), adrenocorticotropic hormone (stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol), and growth hormone. Hence, levels of these hormones would be decreased in Sheehan syndrome.

Option E: Aldosterone is primarily produced in the adrenal cortex and its secretion is regulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), not by the anterior pituitary gland. Therefore, aldosterone levels would likely be normal in this patient with postpartum hypopituitarism.

This patient's hyperglycemia, altered mental status, and absence of ketones on urinalysis are suggestive of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). HHS is a complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is characterized by severe hyperglycemia (>600 mg/dL), increased effective plasma osmolality, and absence of significant ketosis. It is often precipitated by physiologic stress (eg, infection, myocardial infarction, stroke), poor oral intake, or medications (eg, glucocorticoids). Nitrofurantoin, as noted in this patient's history, can also cause hyperglycemia, contributing to the development of HHS.

This patient's profound hyperglycemia (glucose 1,400 mg/dL), altered mental status, and lack of ketonuria are consistent with the diagnosis of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS). HHS is most common in patients with type 2 diabetes and is often precipitated by an infection or other stressor (e.g. urinary tract infection in this patient). Severe insulin deficiency leads to hyperglycemia, which causes osmotic diuresis, dehydration, and hyperosmolarity. As insulin levels in HHS are high enough to suppress lipolysis and ketogenesis, ketoacidosis does not occur.

The mainstay of treatment for HHS is aggressive fluid replacement and insulin therapy. The most appropriate initial step in therapy is therefore administration of intravenous fluids (eg, 0.9% saline) to correct dehydration, and regular insulin to lower glucose levels. Regular insulin is preferred to long-acting insulin (ie, glargine) because it has a rapid onset of action (15 minutes) and can be quickly titrated to the appropriate dose.

Option A: Administering 3% hypertonic saline is not the best choice. This type of solution is used to treat severe cases of hyponatremia, but this patient's main problem is the drastic elevation in his blood glucose levels.

Option C: Lactated ringer's solution is not optimal because it is typically used to replace fluids and electrolytes in patients with burns and trauma, not hyperglycemia.

Option D: Glargine insulin is a long-acting insulin that is not suitable for acute treatment of hyperglycemia 
   
Option E: Regular insulin and potassium can be used in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis, but this patientâ??s urine is negative for ketones, so this is not the best choice."
499,"The patient's inability to be redirected, her highly energetic state, her recent increase in goal-directed activity (eg, the investigation), and her increased sexual drive, all suggest a manic episode, which is characterized by an elevated, expansive, or irritable mood lasting at least 1 week.

This patient's decreased need for sleep, hypersexuality, grandiosity (thinking she is a detective who can solve a master collusion scheme), and distractibility (inability to be redirected from her current theory) are suggestive of a manic episode. Manic episodes are part of bipolar disorder and are characterized by an abnormal and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and persistently increased goal-directed activity or energy lasting at least one week. First-line treatment for acute mania includes mood stabilizers such as lithium or valproate, as well as atypical antipsychotics. Lithium also has a unique antisuicidal property among mood stabilizers, making it a good choice for patients with bipolar disorder, who are at high risk for suicide. This patient's pregnancy test (hCG) is positive, however, so valproate and most atypical antipsychotics are relatively contraindicated due to teratogenicity. Lithium, while it carries a small risk of cardiac teratogenesis (Ebstein anomaly), can be used in pregnancy with appropriate caution and shared decision-making.

Option A (Electroconvulsive therapy) is used when medication is not effective or not tolerated, or in cases of treatment-resistant or life-threatening conditions (e.g., catatonia, severe depression with psychotic features, high suicide risk).

Option B (Fluoxetine) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used mainly for depression and anxiety disorders. It can potentially induce mania in patients with bipolar disorder if used without a mood stabilizer.

Option C (Haloperidol) is a typical antipsychotic used mainly for psychosis and acute agitation. Although it can be used for acute mania, it is not the first-line treatment.

Option E (Valproic acid) is contraindicated in pregnancy due to the high risk of neural tube defects and other anomalies."
506,"The patient's presentation is suggestive of acute inflammatory arthritis, with the knee joint being the most commonly affected site. The presence of a large number of leukocytes (29,000/mm3 with 97% segmented neutrophils) in the synovial fluid is indicative of an inflammatory process. The key to answering this question lies in the use of compensated polarized light microscopy, which is used to identify crystals in the synovial fluid. Although the image is not provided in the question, the differential diagnosis for crystal-induced arthropathy is either gout (caused by monosodium urate crystals) or pseudogout (caused by calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals).

Option 'A', bacterial infection of the joint, is a possibility in a patient with acute monoarthritis. However, in this case, the leukocyte count in the synovial fluid is usually >50,000/mm3, with a predominance of neutrophils, and the fluid is typically more purulent.

Option 'B', calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD), is a cause of crystal-induced arthropathy (pseudogout). However, this would be seen under polarized light microscopy as weakly positively birefringent, rhomboid-shaped crystals.

Option 'C', mechanical stress and trauma, might cause acute knee pain, but it does not account for the inflammatory signs and symptoms or the high leukocyte count in the synovial fluid.

Option 'D', immune complex-mediated cartilage destruction, is a mechanism involved in rheumatoid arthritis. This condition generally presents with chronic (not acute) inflammation in multiple joints (not monoarthritis).

Option 'E', monosodium urate deposition, is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joint space. These crystals are needle-shaped and negatively birefringent under polarized light microscopy. This would account for the patient's acute monoarthritis with a large number of leukocytes in the synovial fluid.

513,"The patient's presentation is indicative of a vascular complication post liver transplantation, specifically hepatic artery thrombosis. The significantly reduced blood flow into the transplanted liver seen on Doppler ultrasound and the increased levels of liver enzymes (AST, ALT, GGT and Alkaline phosphatase) indicate hepatocellular injury and biliary tract injury.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's presentation of recurrent jaundice episodes, high serum bilirubin, and marked elevation of transaminases in the setting of liver transplantation is suggestive of hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT). HAT is a serious complication that usually occurs within the first few months after liver transplantation but can also occur later. Clinical features depend on the degree of ischemia and may include jaundice, right upper quadrant pain, and hepatomegaly. Liver function tests typically show a marked increase in aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase levels due to hepatocellular necrosis. The key diagnostic test is Doppler ultrasonography, which shows lack of arterial flow. Histologically, the liver would show areas of coagulative necrosis due to the ischemia caused by the thrombosis.

Option E, ""Interstitial cellular infiltration with parenchymal fibrosis, obliterative arteritis"" is seen in chronic rejection, which can occur years after transplantation. Chronic rejection is associated with a gradual and progressive increase in serum alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in contrast to the marked elevation of transaminases seen in HAT.

Option A, ""Normal architecture of bile ducts and hepatocytes"" is incorrect because this patient's liver function tests and Doppler ultrasonography findings indicate significant liver damage.

Option B, ""Broad fibrous septations with formation of micronodules"" is characteristic of cirrhosis which typically presents with chronic liver disease, not the acute symptoms seen in this patient.

Option C, ""Ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes"" is seen in alcoholic or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

534,"The answer is 'B': 'Lower threshold potential for Ca2+ channel opening'. 

Heart rate is primarily controlled by the autonomic nervous system through the modulation of the cardiac pacemaker cells' activity, which generate the electrical impulses necessary for heart contraction. These impulses are triggered by the movement of ions across the cell membrane, with calcium ions playing a pivotal role in this process. If the genetically modified mice have a higher threshold for calcium channel opening, it means more stimulus is needed to open these channels and initiate an action potential, thus resulting in a slower heart rate compared to the normal mice.

Now, let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

Option 'A': 'Greater cardiomyocyte size' - Bigger cells don't necessarily mean a faster heart rate. In fact, it could lead to a slower heart rate as the electrical signal would take longer to pass through a larger cell.

Option 'C': 'Greater ratio of heart to body weight' - While this ratio might affect the overall strength of the heart and the volume of blood it can pump, it doesn't directly influence the rate at which the heart beats.

Option 'D': 'Lower number of gap junctions' - Gap junctions facilitate the quick and coordinated spread of electrical signals between cardiomyocytes. Therefore, fewer gap junctions would slow down this spread and thus decrease, not increase, the heart rate.

Option 'E': 'Greater T-tubule density' - While T-tubules help in spreading the action potential throughout the cardiomyocyte and ensure a coordinated contraction, their density does not directly influence the frequency of heartbeats.","stop","the answer is 'b': 'lower threshold potential for ca2+ channel opening'.","B","E","USMLE question: An investigator is studying cardiomyocytes in both normal and genetically modified mice.

After a 10-minute session on a treadmill, the average pulse measured in the normal mice is 680/min, whereas in the genetically modified mice it is only 160/min. Which of the following is most likely to account for the increased heart rate seen in the normal mice?
Option: {'A': 'Greater cardiomyocyte size', 'B': 'Lower threshold potential for Ca2+ channel opening', 'C': 'Greater ratio of heart to body weight', 'D': 'Lower number of gap junctions', 'E': 'Greater T-tubule density'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The most likely answer is B: Lower threshold potential for Ca2+ channel opening.

Heart rate is determined by the rate of depolarization of the cells in the sinoatrial node of the heart. The faster these cells depolarize, the faster the heart rate. The depolarization of these cells is controlled by a number of ion channels, including calcium channels. If the threshold potential for the opening of these channels is lower, then less stimulus is required to open them and depolarization occurs more quickly. This would result in a faster heart rate.

'A: Greater cardiomyocyte size' is not likely to be the reason as larger cells would not necessarily depolarize more quickly. The process of depolarization and repolarization is not dependent on the size of the cells but on the properties of the ion channels in their membranes.

'C: Greater ratio of heart to body weight' is unlikely because while larger heart size might result in a greater cardiac output (due to larger stroke volume), it wouldn't necessarily result in a higher heart rate.

'D: Lower number of gap junctions' would likely decrease the heart rate because gap junctions allow for the rapid spread of electrical impulses across the heart, leading to a coordinated contraction. A decrease in the number of gap junctions would likely slow the rate of conduction and therefore decrease the heart rate.

'E: Greater T-tubule density' is not directly related to the frequency of heart beats. T-tubules play a vital role in excitation-contraction coupling by allowing depolarization of the cell membrane to quickly reach the interior of the cell, which is necessary for the efficient contraction of the heart muscle. However, their density would not affect the rate at which the heart beats."
535,"The correct answer is 'E': Lipase.

This patient's history of chronic pancreatitis due to excessive alcohol use and symptoms of foul-smelling, greasy stools (steatorrhea) suggest that he now has exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). The pancreas produces several digestive enzymes, including amylase, lipase, and proteases such as chymotrypsin, which digest carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, respectively. In the case of EPI, decreased production of these enzymes leads to malabsorption of nutrients, particularly fats, and results in steatorrhea. Among these enzymes, lipase requires the presence of colipase to be active in the duodenum. Colipase is resistant to bile salts, whereas other enzymes such as chymotrypsin are not. Therefore, the enzyme deficient in this patient is most likely lipase.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

'A': Amylase - This enzyme is responsible for carbohydrate digestion, not fat. Its deficiency would not explain the patient's greasy stools.

'B': Chymotrypsin - This enzyme is responsible for protein digestion, not fat. Also, it's inactivated by bile salts, unlike colipase and lipase.

'C': Colipase - This is a cofactor needed for lipase activity and is not an enzyme itself.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is E: Lipase. 

This patient's symptoms are suggestive of steatorrhea, which is characterized by the passage of foul-smelling, greasy, and bulky stools. This is mostly due to fat malabsorption. The major cause of fat malabsorption in this patient is likely to be chronic pancreatitis, a condition resulting from repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis can lead to pancreatic insufficiency, which results in the decreased production of digestive enzymes, including lipase. Lipase, with the help of the cofactor colipase, breaks down fats into fatty acids and glycerol. It is resistant to bile salts, which are essential for emulsification of dietary fats. Without adequate lipase, fats are not absorbed properly and are instead excreted in the stool, leading to steatorrhea.

Option A: Amylase is a pancreatic enzyme that breaks down carbohydrates. While a deficiency in amylase could contribute to malabsorption and diarrhea, it would not cause steatorrhea, as amylase is not involved in fat digestion.

Option B: Chymotrypsin is a protease secreted by the pancreas. It is involved in protein digestion, so a deficiency would not result in steatorrhea.

Option C: Colipase is a protein that is secreted by the pancreas and works with lipase to break down dietary fats. While a deficiency in colipase could contribute to steatorrhea, colipase itself is not an enzyme and it is not resistant to bile salts. 

Option D: Enterokinase is an enzyme that is found in the small intestine. It activates trypsinogen to trypsin, which then activates pancreatic enzymes. Deficiency of this enzyme is very rare and would likely cause a wider range of digestive problems, not just steatorrhea."

542,"The correct answer is B: Inhibition of cytochrome p450.

Azithromycin, an antibiotic, is a weak inhibitor of cytochrome p450. Cytochrome p450 is an important enzyme in the liver that is responsible for metabolizing many drugs, including warfarin. When azithromycin is taken alongside warfarin, it can inhibit the activity of cytochrome p450, leading to reduced metabolism and increased blood levels of warfarin. This can result in an increased INR (International Normalized Ratio), which is a measure of how long it takes for blood to clot. 

Option A, depletion of intestinal flora, is incorrect because azithromycin is not particularly known for affecting gut flora extensively. Furthermore, a change in intestinal flora would not directly affect the metabolism or absorption of warfarin.

Option C, increased non-protein bound warfarin fraction, is incorrect because azithromycin does not affect protein binding of warfarin. Warfarin is highly protein bound and only the free or unbound fraction is active. Changes in protein binding can affect warfarin levels, but azithromycin does not cause this change.

Option D, drug-induced hepatotoxicity, is incorrect because azithromycin is generally not associated with liver toxicity. Moreover, the patient's presentation does not include any signs or symptoms of liver disease.

This patient's increased INR (International Normalized Ratio) is due to the interaction between azithromycin and warfarin. Warfarin is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver. Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, inhibits cytochrome P450, which slows the metabolism and increases the effect of warfarin, leading to an increased INR.

Option A 'Depletion of intestinal flora' is incorrect. Some antibiotics could theoretically deplete vitamin K-producing gut flora and enhance the effect of warfarin. However, this is not a prominent effect of azithromycin.

Option C 'Increased non-protein bound warfarin fraction' is incorrect. Certain drugs can displace warfarin from plasma protein binding sites and increase the free fraction of the drug, thereby increasing its effect. However, azithromycin does not have this effect.

Option D 'Drug-induced hepatotoxicity' is incorrect. While drug-induced liver injury could theoretically reduce the metabolism of warfarin, it generally takes longer than one week to develop and the patient does not have any clinical or laboratory evidence of liver injury.

Option D (DNAse positive) is characteristic of S. aureus but it does not differentiate S. aureus from other Staphylococcus species. The coagulase test, however, does differentiate S. aureus from other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species."
575,"This patient's short stature, delayed bone age, absent pubic and axillary hair, and delayed breast development suggest constitutional delay of growth and puberty, the most common cause of short stature and delayed puberty. Constitutional delay is often familial, as suggested by the father's similar history. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulses from the hypothalamus lead to pulsatile secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary, which in turn stimulate estrogen production from the ovaries. Delayed secretion of GnRH results in delayed increases in LH, FSH, and estrogen, leading to delayed puberty.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is ""A"" (â??â??â??â??), indicating decreased levels of FSH, LH, Estrogen, and GnRH.

Option ""B"" (â??â??â??â??) is incorrect as it suggests decreased FSH, LH, and GnRH but increased estrogen, which is inconsistent with this patient's presentation. 

Option ""C"" (Normal normal normal normal) is incorrect because this patient's delayed puberty suggests that her levels of GnRH, LH, FSH, and estrogen are likely decreased, not normal.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's short stature, delayed puberty, and family history of similar findings are suggestive of constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP), the most common cause of delayed puberty. CDGP is a variant of normal puberty often seen in boys but also occurring in girls. It is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with variable expressivity, as may be the case in this patient given her father's similar history. Patients with CDGP are healthy and have normal growth hormone and thyroid function. They grow at a normal rate during childhood but have a delayed growth spurt in comparison with their peers. They also have delayed skeletal maturation (e.g., bone age), which eventually coincides with height age, and delayed gonadal development. This patient's Tanner stage 2 breast development is consistent with initiation of puberty, but lack of pubic hair suggests gonadarche (ie, increased gonadotropins leading to ovarian estrogen production) has not yet occurred. In late childhood, prior to the onset of puberty, both boys and girls have low levels of sex steroids (ie, estrogen, testosterone) and gonadotropins (ie, luteinizing hormone [LH], follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH]); gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is also low due to hypothalamic inhibition. Therefore, the answer is 'A' ? ? ? ?.

The other options are incorrect because they suggest various states of hormonal imbalance which are not consistent with the patient's presentation. CDGP is a normal variant and is not associated with hormonal dysfunction or deficiency. For example, option 'B' ? ? ? ? could indicate a gonadal (primary) cause of delayed puberty. Option 'C' Normal normal normal normal is incorrect because prepubertal levels of sex hormones and gonadotropins are low, not normal. Option 'D' ? ? ? ? could indicate a state of hormone resistance. Option 'E' Normal normal ? normal would not be expected in a prepubertal individual, as sex hormone levels should be low."
579,"The correct answer is C: 'Inhibition of aminolevulinate dehydratase'. 

The patient's history of dark urine, scleral icterus, and the sudden onset of back pain along with the laboratory findings, which indicate hemolysis (elevated indirect bilirubin, low haptoglobin, and hemoglobinuria), suggest a diagnosis of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). This condition, which typically presents with intermittent neurovisceral attacks, is due to a deficiency of porphobilinogen deaminase (also known as hydroxymethylbilane synthase). However, aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase (an earlier enzyme in the heme synthesis pathway) can also be deficient in a rare form of porphyria (ALA dehydratase deficiency porphyria). Both deficiencies can result in the accumulation of the neurotoxic precursors ALA and porphobilinogen, causing the observed symptoms. 

The other options can be ruled out as follows: 

A: Crescent-shaped erythrocytes are seen in conditions like sickle cell anemia which is not the case here.
B: Absence of reduced glutathione is typically seen in conditions like G6PD deficiency, causing oxidative stress and hemolytic anemia. However, the patient's presentation is more consistent with porphyria.
D: Absence of uridine 5'-monophosphate is seen in orotic aciduria, a disorder of pyrimidine synthesis, not associated with this clinical scenario.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The patient's anemia, back pain, and dark urine suggest intravascular hemolysis, which is the destruction of red blood cells within the blood vessels. This is often due to oxidative stress on red blood cells. The patient's recent use of isoniazid for latent tuberculosis is important because isoniazid can cause sideroblastic anemia by inhibiting the enzyme aminolevulinate dehydratase (option C), causing an accumulation of free erythrocyte protoporphyrin and reduced synthesis of heme. This leads to the formation of ringed sideroblasts in the bone marrow. 

Aminolevulinate dehydratase is necessary for the synthesis of heme, which is a component of hemoglobin. Inhibition of this enzyme may lead to anemia and symptoms of hemolysis, including jaundice and dark urine.

Option A, Crescent-shaped erythrocytes, refers to sickle cell anemia, a genetic disorder that affects the shape and function of red blood cells. This patient's symptoms and history do not suggest sickle cell anemia.

Option B, Absence of reduced glutathione, refers to conditions such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. G6PD helps protect red blood cells from oxidative damage, and deficiency can lead to episodes of hemolysis. However, this is usually triggered by infections, certain medications, or ingestion of fava beans, none of which is mentioned in the patient's history.

Option D, Absence of uridine 5'-monophosphate, refers to orotic aciduria, a disorder that affects the body's ability to make new DNA. Patients with this condition usually present with megaloblastic anemia and orotic acid in the urine. This does not fit the patient's presentation.

Option E, Defective ankyrin in the RBC membrane, refers to hereditary spherocytosis, a condition that affects the red blood cell membrane, leading to hemolytic anemia. This is usually a hereditary condition and the patient's history does not suggest this."
581,"This patient's fatigue, diplopia, eyelid ptosis, and proximal muscle weakness that improves with activity are suggestive of myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disease characterized by autoantibodies against acetylcholine receptors (AChR), muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), or lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 at the neuromuscular junction. The most common form of myasthenia gravis is AChR antibody-positive (85% of cases), followed by MuSK antibody-positive (1%-7% of cases). AChR and MuSK antibody-positive myasthenia gravis manifest similarly, but MuSK antibody-positive patients more frequently have bulbar symptoms (eg, dysarthria, dysphagia). 

Given the patient's long smoking history, the presence of a thymoma should also be considered. Thymomas are associated with myasthenia gravis in about 10%-15% of cases and can also manifest with pure red cell aplasia and hypogammaglobulinemia (Good's syndrome). 

Therefore, the correct answer is E, 'Thymoma on CT scan of the chest'.

As for the other options:

A. 'Antibodies against muscle-specific kinase' is incorrect. Although myasthenia gravis can have MuSK antibodies, AChR antibodies are more common.

It is more common in females and can present at any age. Symptoms get worse with repeated use (fatigability) and improve with rest. Ptosis and diplopia due to ocular muscle involvement are common initial features. Proximal limb weakness can cause difficulty in climbing stairs, arising from a low chair, lifting, or combing hair. Bulbar weakness can cause dysarthria and dysphagia, leading to weight loss. MG is associated with thymic hyperplasia or thymoma. Therefore, all patients diagnosed with MG should have a CT scan of the chest to evaluate for thymoma (option E).

Serum antibodies against acetylcholine receptors are detected in 85% of patients with generalized MG and 50% of patients with ocular MG. However, antibodies against muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) are found only in a small subset of patients, generally those who are seronegative for acetylcholine receptor antibodies (option A). Serum creatine kinase level is normal or mildly elevated in MG (option B). Repetitive nerve stimulation at slow rates (2-3 Hz) shows a decremental response in MG, not an incremental pattern as seen in Lambert-Eaton syndrome (option C).

591,"The correct answer is D: Zaleplon.

This patient has chronic insomnia, which is characterized by poor sleep quality or quantity that leads to daytime impairment. It is common in the elderly and can be related to poor sleep habits, medical or psychiatric disorders, specific sleep disorders, or certain medications or substances. Nonpharmacological interventions, such as sleep hygiene and cognitive-behavioral therapy, are first-line treatments for chronic insomnia. When these interventions are not successful, short-term pharmacotherapy may be useful.

Zaleplon (Option D) is a short-acting nonbenzodiazepine sleep agent that is quickly metabolized with a half-life of approximately 1 hour. It can be taken at bedtime or in the middle of the night if the patient is having trouble falling asleep. Because of its rapid metabolism, zaleplon is less likely than other medications to cause daytime sleepiness or cognitive impairment, making it a good option for this patient.

Temazepam (Option A) and flurazepam (Option E) are long-acting benzodiazepines that may be associated with daytime sedation and cognitive impairment, especially in the elderly.

Diphenhydramine (Option B) is an over-the-counter antihistamine that is often used for insomnia. However, it has anticholinergic properties that can cause confusion, urinary retention, dry mouth, and blurred vision, particularly in the elderly.

Therefore, it is appropriate for this patient who does not want a drug that makes him drowsy during the day.

A: Temazepam is a benzodiazepine used for short-term treatment of insomnia but it can cause daytime drowsiness which the patient does not want.

B: Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine with sedative properties, commonly used for insomnia. However, it can lead to daytime drowsiness, impaired cognitive function, and anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth and constipation.

D: Zaleplon is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic used for short-term treatment of insomnia. It has a short half-life and is primarily used for sleep onset insomnia. However, it can also cause daytime drowsiness which the patient does not want.

599,"The correct answer here is E: Initiate nifedipine therapy.

This patient is in preterm labor, with regular contractions, cervical dilatation and effacement, and ruptured membranes at 26 weeks' gestation. Administration of tocolytics should be considered if patients present with symptoms of preterm labor before 34 weeks' gestation, as is the case here. Nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, is a first-line tocolytic agent used to delay delivery for up to 48 hours, allowing time for the administration of antenatal corticosteroids. Antenatal corticosteroids have been shown to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with preterm birth by accelerating fetal lung maturity.

Options A, B, C, and D are incorrect for the following reasons:

Option A: Perform cesarean delivery is not the correct answer because the fetus is preterm and does not need to be delivered immediately unless there is a nonreassuring fetal status or contraindication to tocolytic therapy (eg, maternal hemorrhage, severe preeclampsia).

Option B: Allow vaginal delivery is also incorrect because this patient is in preterm labor, and efforts should be made to delay delivery and allow for fetal lung maturity.

Option C: Initiate misoprostol therapy is incorrect because misoprostol is a prostaglandin analog used for cervical ripening and labor induction, not for delaying labor.

She also has sonographic findings consistent with alobar holoprosencephaly (fused thalami, absent corpus callosum, absent third ventricle, and absent lateral ventricles), which is a severe congenital brain malformation resulting from incomplete separation of the cerebral hemispheres. This condition is associated with severe neurologic impairment and a poor prognosis, including neonatal death. The facial findings (median cleft lip) and polyhydramnios (due to impaired swallowing) are also commonly seen in alobar holoprosencephaly. 

The first-line treatment for preterm labor without contraindications is tocolysis, with the goal of delaying delivery to allow for administration of glucocorticoids, which accelerate fetal lung maturity (choice E). Tocolytics such as nifedipine may be used to inhibit uterine contractions, delay delivery, and allow time for the mother to be transferred to a facility capable of caring for a preterm newborn if necessary. 

Option A (Perform cesarean delivery) is not the preferred mode of delivery in preterm labor unless there is an absolute contraindication to a vaginal delivery (eg, placenta previa, transverse lie). In addition, the fetus has severe malformations with a poor prognosis, and it is typically not appropriate to expedite delivery in such cases.
Option B (Allow vaginal delivery) would be appropriate if it was not possible to stop the preterm labor. However, attempts should first be made to delay delivery.
Option C (Initiate misoprostol therapy) would be used for cervical ripening or labor induction, neither of which is the goal in this patient at 26 weeks' gestation.
Option D (Perform dilation and evacuation) is a surgical procedure used for abortion in the second trimester and is not indicated here.

655,"This patient's signs and symptoms are indicative of Cushing syndrome, which includes central obesity, moon facies, striae, depression, and hypertension. The initial evaluation of Cushing syndrome includes a 24-hour urinary cortisol, late-night salivary cortisol, or low-dose dexamethasone suppression test. Confirmation of elevated cortisol levels should be followed by an ACTH level to differentiate between ACTH-dependent and ACTH-independent causes. 

This patient's elevated ACTH suggests an ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome. ACTH-dependent causes of Cushing syndrome are generally divided into pituitary (Cushing disease) and ectopic sources. Cushing disease is much more common, and the first step in differentiation is typically an MRI of the head with contrast to visualize the pituitary gland (Choice A). 

Choice B (Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses) is the next step if the MRI is negative or equivocal but there is still a high suspicion for Cushing disease. 

Choice C (High-dose dexamethasone suppression test) is also used to differentiate Cushing disease from ectopic ACTH but is generally reserved for cases in which petrosal sinus sampling is not available or is contraindicated. 

Choice D (CT scan of the abdomen with contrast) may be done if ACTH levels are not elevated, suggesting an adrenal or other ACTH-independent cause of Cushing syndrome.

Choice E (Bilateral adrenalectomy) would be a treatment option if the source of excess ACTH could not be found or if initial surgery did not cure the disease, not a diagnostic step.","stop","","A","C","USMLE question: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months.

Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 Ã?Â¼g/L and 253 Ã?Â¼g/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 Ã?Â¼g (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7Ã¢â?¬â??50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
Option: {'A': 'MRI of the head with contrast', 'B': 'Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses', 'C': 'High-dose dexamethasone suppression test', 'D': 'CT scan of the abdomen with contrast', 'E': 'Bilateral adrenalectomy'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's weight gain, hypertension, plethoric face, central obesity, and skin changes (violet stretch marks on abdomen) are all suggestive of Cushing's syndrome. The elevated midnight serum cortisol levels, 24-hour urinary cortisol levels, and ACTH levels confirm the presence of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome.

There are two main causes of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome:

1. Pituitary adenoma (Cushing disease), which is the most common cause.
2. Ectopic secretion of ACTH, which is often due to small cell lung cancer or a carcinoid tumor.

To distinguish between these two, we need to evaluate the source of the ACTH. In Cushing disease, ACTH production will follow a pituitary gradient and will be higher in the inferior petrosal sinus (which drains the pituitary) relative to the peripheral blood. In ectopic ACTH production, the levels will be the same or lower in the inferior petrosal sinus than in the periphery.

Therefore, the next step in the evaluation of this patient should be to measure ACTH levels in the inferior petrosal sinuses (Option B).

Option A (MRI of the head with contrast) would be done if we have a strong suspicion of a pituitary adenoma, but it should not be the first step. 

Option C (High-dose dexamethasone suppression test) is another way to differentiate between ectopic ACTH production and Cushing disease, but ACTH measurement in the inferior petrosal sinus is more definitive.

Option D (CT scan of the abdomen with contrast) would be done if there's suspicion of an adrenal tumor, which is less likely in this case due to the elevated ACTH levels (ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome would be expected in case of an adrenal tumor)

Option E (Bilateral adrenalectomy) would only be considered after confirming the diagnosis and localization of the disease and failure of other treatments. It is not an appropriate next step in the evaluation."
662,"The correct answer is E. Vitamin B12 deficiency.

The patient's fatigue and generalized weakness, along with her slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, suggest she may have anemia. Furthermore, her mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is elevated (normal range is 80-100 fL), which indicates macrocytic anemia. Macrocytic anemia can be caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, alcoholism, liver disease, or certain medications like hydroxyurea. In this case, there is no other evidence to suggest alcoholism or liver disease. Hydroxyurea is not mentioned as one of her medications.

Option A, Depression, is incorrect because although depression can cause fatigue and generalized weakness, it would not cause macrocytic anemia. 

Option B, Gastrointestinal bleed, is incorrect because this would typically cause microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency, not macrocytic anemia. 

Option C, Iron deficiency, is incorrect for the same reason as option B. Iron deficiency would cause microcytic anemia, not macrocytic anemia. 

Option D, Medication side effect, could potentially be correct if the patient were taking a medication known to cause macrocytic anemia. However, none of the patient's medications mentioned in the scenario are known to cause this condition.

This patient's fatigue and generalized weakness in the setting of macrocytic anemia (MCV >100 fL) is suggestive of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. Both deficiencies lead to impaired DNA synthesis and subsequent macrocytosis. However, the patient's recent initiation of disease-modifying therapy for rheumatoid arthritis makes vitamin B12 deficiency more likely because methotrexate, a commonly used disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), is a folate antagonist. 

Depression (Option A) can cause fatigue and loss of interest in activities, but it wouldn't explain the patient's macrocytic anemia. Gastrointestinal bleed (Option B) can cause fatigue due to anemia, but it would typically result in a microcytic, not macrocytic, anemia due to iron deficiency. Iron deficiency (Option C) also results in a microcytic anemia. Finally, while medication side effects (Option D) can cause fatigue, they wouldn't explain the macrocytic anemia in this patient."
667,"This patient's presentation is consistent with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), specifically Crohn's disease. The clinical picture of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and blood in stools accompanied by extraintestinal manifestations (e.g., erythema nodosum and arthritis) and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate all indicate IBD. The colonoscopy findings of patchy transmural inflammation with skipped areas (""cobblestoning"") and rectal sparing are characteristic of Crohn's disease. 

When Crohn's disease is resistant to first-line therapy (e.g., sulfasalazine), the next step is to add an immunosuppressive agent such as azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine. The most common side effect of these medications is bone marrow suppression, leading to leukopenia and, less frequently, to megaloblastic anemia (Option D). 

Let's review why the other options are incorrect:
- Option A: Worsening of osteoporosis: Some medications like corticosteroids can cause bone loss, but azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine are not associated with this side effect. 
- Option B: Infection: Although azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine are immunosuppressive agents that can increase the risk of infection, bone marrow suppression is a more common side effect. 
- Option C: Rash: These drugs do not typically cause rashes, which are more commonly associated with sulfasalazine.
- Option E: Hepatotoxicity: Although azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine can cause hepatotoxicity, this is less common than bone marrow suppression.

The patient's headache characteristics (ie, bilateral, non-throbbing, moderate intensity, not aggravated by physical activity) and associated symptoms (ie, photophobia but no vomiting or auditory/visual changes) are indicative of tension-type headache (TTH). TTH is the most common type of headache and is often related to stress, anxiety, depression, or musculoskeletal problems in the neck. Patients with TTH often work in high-stress jobs and/or spend long hours working in one fixed position, which can lead to muscle tension. As such, first-line treatment often involves non-pharmacological strategies such as reassurance, identification of headache triggers (eg, stress, missed meals, sleep disturbances), relaxation techniques, regular exercise, and physical therapy/massage.

Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with a major depressive episode characterized by depressed mood, anhedonia (eg, loss of interest in gym and reading), and impairment in social functioning (eg, stopping job training). He has responded well to paroxetine (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, or SSRI) and has had no side effects. The goal of acute phase treatment in major depressive disorder (MDD) is to achieve remission of symptoms, which he has accomplished. This should be followed by continuation phase treatment aimed at preventing relapse. This phase typically lasts for 4-9 months.

Option 'A: Continue paroxetine therapy for 2 years' is incorrect. Two years of therapy might be considered for maintenance therapy, which is typically reserved for patients with recurrent MDD (=2 episodes), chronic MDD (>2 years), or MDD with psychotic features. This patient does not fit into these categories.

Option 'B: Switch from paroxetine to venlafaxine therapy' is incorrect, as there is no reason to switch antidepressant medications. The patient has responded well to paroxetine without any side effects.

Option 'C: Discontinue paroxetine' is incorrect. Discontinuation would place the patient at high risk for a relapse of his depressive symptoms.

Option 'E: Switch from paroxetine to lithium therapy' is incorrect. Lithium is typically used for patients with bipolar disorder, not unipolar major depressive disorder. Additionally, there is no evidence of treatment-resistant depression, which might be an indication for lithium augmentation."

This patient with nulliparous term pregnancy is in the second stage of labor (ie, from complete cervical dilation to delivery). The second stage is further divided into a passive phase (ie, complete dilation to significant fetal descent) and an active phase (ie, significant fetal descent to delivery). In nulliparous women, the passive phase can last up to 3 hours with epidural anesthesia and 1 hour without. The active phase can last up to 2 hours with epidural anesthesia and 1 hour without. Prolonged second stage of labor is diagnosed if the total duration of the second stage exceeds these times. 

In this patient, the second stage of labor has been ongoing for 2 hours without significant fetal descent, and she has not received epidural anesthesia. Therefore, assisted vaginal delivery (eg, vacuum, forceps) is indicated to expedite delivery.

This patient has had no change in station after 2 hours. If the fetus is estimated to be macrosomic (ie, estimated fetal weight =4,500 g), cesarean delivery should be performed. However, this patient's estimated fetal weight is at the 75th percentile, likely <4,500 g. Therefore, operative vaginal delivery (eg, vacuum extraction, forceps) should be attempted if there are no contraindications (eg, nonvertex presentation, prior cesarean delivery with a classical incision).

Option A (Administration of terbutaline) is incorrect. Terbutaline is a tocolytic used to delay labor, not to promote its progression or fetal descent.

Option B (Cesarean section) is incorrect. Although cesarean section is an option when there is protracted labor, the baby in this case is estimated to be of a weight that should allow for vaginal birth, so an assisted vaginal delivery would be attempted first.

Option D (Observation for another hour) is incorrect. The baby's descent has been arrested for 2 hours in a nulliparous woman without analgesia, indicating the need for intervention.

Steven-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a severe, potentially life-threatening mucocutaneous disease with an overall mortality rate of 5% - 15%. It is often drug-induced, and common culprits include anticonvulsants, allopurinol, antibiotics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). SJS often begins with a prodrome of fever, malaise, and upper respiratory symptoms, followed by the rapid onset of painful erythematous or purpuric macules that may coalesce. Flaccid bullae, erosions, and target lesions can also be seen, and the lesions can eventually lead to sloughing of the epidermis. The distinguishing feature of SJS, however, is widespread involvement of the mucous membranes (e.g., oral, ocular, genital), which is seen in almost all cases.

The initial phase can mimic a systemic infection, with fever, malaise, and upper respiratory symptoms. This is followed by a painful, erythematous rash that starts on the trunk and spreads to the face and extremities. The rash often becomes bullous before the skin sloughs off. Mucosal involvement is common and can affect any mucosal surface including the oropharynx, eyes, and genitals. The most commonly implicated drugs include allopurinol, sulfonamides, antiepileptics (eg, lamotrigine, carbamazepine), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and antiretrovirals.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The most likely diagnosis in this case is 'B': 'Congenital adrenal hyperplasia'. 

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in impaired cortisol synthesis. The most common form is 21-hydroxylase deficiency, accounting for 90% of cases. Decreased cortisol production results in increased adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion due to loss of negative feedback. Elevated ACTH stimulates the adrenal gland, leading to an overproduction of adrenal steroids proximal to the enzyme block, particularly adrenal androgens. 

The patient's severe acne and abnormally advanced height are clues to androgen excess. Other signs of virilization include clitoromegaly and labial fusion in females. In this case, the patient's prenatal virilization (eg, clitoromegaly at birth, maternal hirsutism during pregnancy) suggests the classic form of CAH, in which symptoms are present at birth or in early childhood. 

The patient's history of multiple fractures with minor trauma is a clue to glucocorticoid replacement overtreatment, which can lead to iatrogenic Cushing syndrome and osteoporosis.

'A': 'Polycystic ovary syndrome' is incorrect as this condition is usually associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and hirsutism but would not explain this patient's history of prenatal virilization and clitoromegaly at birth.
 
'C': 'Hyperprolactinemia' often presents with galactorrhea, visual field defects, and amenorrhea, not androgen excess.

'D': 'Turner syndrome' would typically present with short stature and gonadal dysgenesis but not virilization or multiple cysts in ovaries.

'E': 'Aromatase deficiency' would present with virilization of the mother during pregnancy and progressive virilization of the female infant after birth due to an excess of circulating androgens, which cannot be converted to estrogens. However, unlike CAH, this condition would not present with adrenal crisis, which seems to be the case with this patient."
710,"The correct answer is 'A': Decreased systemic vascular resistance.

The patient in this scenario is likely suffering from hemorrhagic shock, a subtype of hypovolemic shock, due to trauma and multiple rib fractures. Hemorrhagic shock is due to the loss of intravascular volume, which leads to decreased preload, stroke volume, and cardiac output. To compensate, the body will initially increase heart rate and systemic vascular resistance (vasoconstriction) to maintain blood pressure and tissue perfusion.

However, as shock progresses, compensatory mechanisms fail, leading to vasodilation and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. This is often reflected by cool, clammy skin and delayed capillary refill, as seen in the patient. Decreased systemic vascular resistance leads to hypotension, further exacerbating tissue hypoperfusion.

Regarding the other options:

Option 'B': Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is a measure of left atrial pressure. In hypovolemic shock, it would likely be decreased due to reduced preload, not increased.

Option 'C': Mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) reflects the balance between oxygen delivery and consumption. In the setting of shock, SvO2 would be decreased, not increased, due to increased tissue extraction of oxygen secondary to decreased delivery.

Option 'D': Cardiac output is a function of heart rate and stroke volume. Though heart rate is initially increased in response to hypovolemia, stroke volume decreases due to reduced preload, leading to decreased cardiac output.

Option 'E': Right atrial pressure would likely be decreased in hypovolemic shock due to reduced blood volume and preload.","stop","the correct answer is 'a': decreased systemic vascular resistance.","A","B","USMLE question: A 34-year-old male is brought to the emergency department by fire and rescue following a motor vehicle accident in which the patient was an unrestrained driver.

Option: {'A': 'Decreased systemic vascular resistance', 'B': 'Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure', 'C': 'Increased mixed venous oxygen saturation', 'D': 'Increased cardiac output', 'E': 'Increased right atrial pressure'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is 'A: Decreased systemic vascular resistance'. 

This patient has hemorrhagic shock secondary to trauma, likely from injury to the spleen given his left upper quadrant bruising and multiple left lower rib fractures.

Hemorrhagic shock is characterized by decreased effective circulating blood volume, which leads to decreased stroke volume and cardiac output. This in turn triggers a compensatory increase in heart rate (to maintain cardiac output) and systemic vascular resistance (to maintain blood pressure). However, as shock worsens, compensatory mechanisms fail, and systemic vascular resistance also drops, leading to hypotension. Other signs of shock include mental status changes (eg, somnolence), pale and cool skin, weak or thready pulses, and delayed capillary refill. 

Option B: Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) is used as an indirect measure of left atrial pressure. In hemorrhagic shock, PCWP would be low, not high, as there is insufficient blood volume to fill the left atrium.

Option C: Mixed venous oxygen saturation corresponds to the oxygen content of blood returning to the right side of the heart. In shock, there is increased extraction of oxygen from hemoglobin by tissues, leading to a decrease in mixed venous oxygen saturation.

Option D: In hemorrhagic shock, cardiac output is decreased due to low preload from blood loss. Initially, this is somewhat compensated with an increased heart rate, but as shock worsens, cardiac output also drops.

Option E: Right atrial pressure (also called central venous pressure) reflects the filling pressure of the right side of the heart. In hemorrhagic shock, this would be decreased due to insufficient blood volume."
720,"The correct answer is B: 'Perform an ultrasound examination with nuchal translucency and crown-rump length measurement'.

This patient's serum screening shows high beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) and low pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) which is suggestive of Down syndrome in the fetus. First trimester screening for aneuploidy combines serum biomarkers (beta-hCG and PAPP-A) with ultrasound measurement of nuchal translucency (NT) and crown-rump length (CRL). Since serum biomarkers are already abnormal, the next best step in the management is to perform an ultrasound for NT and CRL measurement. Increased NT and abnormal serum markers are indicative of increased risk for aneuploidy.

Option A: A blood test for rubella, cytomegalovirus, and toxoplasma IgG would be irrelevant in this case, as there is no indication for infection in the patient or fetus.

Option C: Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is typically performed between 10 and 13 weeks gestation and can diagnose chromosomal disorders; however, it carries a slightly higher risk of miscarriage than amniocentesis. It is not the first step in this case.

Option D: Amniocentesis is typically performed after 15 weeks of gestation and carries a lower risk of miscarriage compared to CVS. However, it is not indicated as the next step in this case.

Option E: The quadruple test is a second trimester screening test performed at 15-20 weeks gestation. It includes alpha-fetoprotein, unconjugated estriol, beta-hCG, and inhibin A.

This patient's blood tests show a pattern consistent with a high risk of Down syndrome in the fetus: high beta-hCG and low PAPP-A. These tests are part of the first trimester combined test (along with nuchal translucency by ultrasound), which is used to estimate the risk of the fetus having Down syndrome (trisomy 21), trisomy 18, or trisomy 13. Therefore, the next most appropriate step would be to complete the combined test by performing an ultrasound to measure nuchal translucency and crown-rump length.

Option A is incorrect because the patient doesn't have any signs of infection or risk factors for any of the mentioned infections, so these tests are not warranted at this time.

Option C is incorrect because chorionic villus sampling is an invasive procedure and is not the first-line test for Down syndrome. It is usually considered if the combined test indicates a high risk and the patient wishes to have a definitive diagnosis.

Option D is also incorrect because amniocentesis is another invasive procedure that is usually done later in pregnancy (15-20 weeks). It is usually considered if the second-trimester screening tests (quadruple test) indicate a high risk and the patient wishes to have a definitive diagnosis.

728,"The correct answer is 'B': Chronic renal failure. 

The patient's metabolic profile reveals a metabolic acidosis, as evidenced by the decreased bicarbonate level, and renal insufficiency, as evidenced by the elevated BUN and creatinine levels. The combination of these findings suggests chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is most likely due to his longstanding history of hypertension and diabetes, two of the most common causes of CKD. In CKD, a reduced number of functioning nephrons leads to decreased ammoniagenesis and diminished acid excretion, which manifests as a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. Hyperkalemia is also seen in CKD due to decreased potassium excretion.

733,"The correct answer is A: Past history of recurrent wheezing.

Methylphenidate is a psychostimulant and the most commonly used medication for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Common side effects of methylphenidate include decreased appetite, stomachache, headache, and difficulty falling asleep. However, it can also cause increased heart rate and blood pressure. Therefore, a comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation (including blood pressure and heart rate measurement, cardiac auscultation, and inquiry for symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular disease such as exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or palpitations) should be conducted prior to initiating therapy, especially in patients with a history of cardiac disease. In the same vein, a history of recurrent wheezing could suggest underlying reactive airway disease or asthma, conditions that could potentially be exacerbated by the increased sympathetic activity caused by stimulant medications.

737,"The patient's history of normal breast development but absent pubic and axillary hair and primary amenorrhea suggests a diagnosis of Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS). AIS, also known as testicular feminization, is an X-linked recessive disorder in which a genetic male (46, XY) is resistant to the action of androgens. Despite the presence of internal testes, individuals with AIS have female external genitalia due to a default development pathway in the absence of androgen effect. At puberty, increased testosterone from the testes is aromatized to estradiol, leading to breast development, but lack of androgen effect results in absent or scanty pubic and axillary hair and a short blind-ending vagina. The diagnosis can be confirmed by finding a 46, XY karyotype on chromosomal analysis.

The testes in AIS individuals are at increased risk of gonadal tumors, particularly after puberty. Therefore, gonadectomy (Choice A) is recommended after puberty or once female secondary sexual characteristics have developed due to estrogen secretion by the testes. Prior to gonadectomy, these patients can maintain bone health through the natural conversion of testosterone to estrogen. After gonadectomy, they will require estrogen replacement therapy (Choice B) to maintain secondary sexual characteristics and bone health.

This is a condition in which the MÃ¼llerian ducts fail to develop, resulting in a congenitally absent or hypoplastic uterus and upper vagina but with normal development of secondary sexual characteristics and normal 46,XX karyotype. Secondary sexual characteristics develop normally because the ovaries (derived from the genital ridge, not the MÃ¼llerian ducts) are not affected and therefore produce normal amounts of estrogen.

The best next step in management is to confirm the diagnosis through imaging, which would typically show a small or absent uterus. Afterward, the primary management is focused on enabling sexual function through creation of a neovagina, usually via a nonsurgical (eg, vaginal dilators) or surgical (eg, vaginoplasty) approach (choice C). 

Gonadectomy (choice A) is not recommended because these patients usually have normal female chromosomes and normal ovaries that produce estrogen, which is necessary for bone health and other functions. In addition, the likelihood of gonadal malignancy is not increased in MRKH as it is with other conditions of sexual development (eg, androgen insensitivity syndrome).

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The patient's symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired daytime functioning, episodes of falling asleep suddenly, and difficulty falling asleep at night are suggestive of a sleep disorder. The two most likely possibilities given his symptomatology are obstructive sleep apnea and narcolepsy. Obstructive sleep apnea is typically associated with obesity, loud snoring, and episodes of apnea during sleep. His lack of obesity and absence of nighttime symptoms make this less likely. Narcolepsy, on the other hand, is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone), sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations. While this patient does not have the complete symptomatology of narcolepsy, this condition often presents initially with just excessive daytime sleepiness and can progress to include the other symptoms over time.

Polysomnography (option B) is the diagnostic test of choice for narcolepsy. It involves overnight monitoring of the patient's brain waves, oxygen level in the blood, heart rate, and breathing, as well as eye and leg movements. Multiple sleep latency test, an objective measure of daytime sleepiness that assesses how quickly a patient falls asleep in a quiet environment during the day, may be done following polysomnography if narcolepsy is suspected. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

Option A, Ethosuximide, is a medication used to treat absence seizures, which this patient's ""daydreaming"" episodes may resemble. However, absence seizures are brief, lasting only seconds, and occur multiple times a day, starting in childhood. This patient's symptoms are not consistent with absence seizures.

Option C, Bright light therapy, is used for circadian rhythm sleep disorders and seasonal affective disorder. Bright light therapy is unlikely to help this patient's symptoms.

Option D, Modafinil, is a stimulant that promotes wakefulness. It is used to treat excessive daytime sleepiness in conditions like narcolepsy, but it should only be started after a formal sleep study has confirmed the diagnosis.

Option E, Zolpidem, is a sedative-hypnotic used for insomnia. It is not indicated in this patient who has excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden sleep attacks."
769,"This patient's fever, cough, shortness of breath, and right-sided rales/bronchial breath sounds are suggestive of pneumonia. His obese body habitus, sedentary job, and sudden hemodynamic compromise suggest a pulmonary embolism (PE) superimposed on his pneumonia. Symptoms of PE can be nonspecific and are often masked in patients with underlying lung disease (eg, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), delaying the diagnosis. Clinical features suggesting PE in this patient include acute onset of symptoms and signs of right heart strain as evidenced by the elevated jugular venous pressure, new systolic murmur suggestive of tricuspid regurgitation, and hypotension. 

A high clinical suspicion for PE should prompt immediate empirical therapy with anticoagulation. However, in a patient with hemodynamic instability (eg, hypotension), the diagnosis must be confirmed as soon as possible to guide potentially life-saving therapy (eg, thrombolysis, surgical embolectomy). Echocardiography is helpful in such cases as it can immediately be performed at the bedside and may show signs of acute right ventricular (RV) pressure overload. Findings of RV strain include RV dilation (apical four-chamber view), RV free wall hypokinesis, interventricular septal flattening (""D sign""), and tricuspid regurgitation. 

So, the correct answer is B, Echocardiogram.

Option A, C, D, and E are incorrect. Given the patient's current hemodynamic instability, it would be inappropriate to administer antibiotics for pneumonia (option A), perform a bronchoscopy (option C), or send the patient away from the critical care setting for diagnostic imaging (options D and E) before first assessing for and treating a possible life-threatening PE.","stop","so, the correct answer is b, echocardiogram.","B","E","USMLE question: A 38-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after losing consciousness upon rising from his chair at work. The patient has had progressive cough, shortness of breath, fever, and chills for 6 days but did not seek medical attention for these symptoms. He appears distressed, flushed, and diaphoretic. He is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 120 kg (265 lbs); BMI is 41.5 kg/m2. His temperature is 39.4Ã?Â°C (102.9Ã?Â°F), pulse is 129/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 91/50 mm Hg when supine. Crackles and bronchial breath sounds are heard over the right posterior hemithorax. A 2/6 midsystolic blowing murmur is heard along the left upper sternal border. Examination shows diffuse diaphoresis, flushed extremities, and dullness to percussion over the right posterior hemithorax. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Multiple nurses and physicians have been unable to attain intravenous access. A large-bore central venous catheter is inserted into the right internal jugular vein by standard sterile procedure. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?
Option: {'A': 'Administer intravenous levofloxacin', 'B': 'Echocardiogram', 'C': 'Bronchoscopy', 'D': 'CT scan of the chest', 'E': 'Chest X-ray'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's fever, cough, dyspnea, and bronchial breath sounds with dullness to percussion suggest a community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by parapneumonic effusion. His hypotension and tachycardia likely indicate sepsis, and he requires immediate administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics (eg, levofloxacin, ceftriaxone + azithromycin) within 1 hour of recognition of sepsis or septic shock. This initial resuscitation should also include 30 mL/kg of intravenous crystalloid fluid within the first 3 hours to target a mean arterial pressure =65 mm Hg.

Further evaluation for sources of infection and complications (eg, chest x-ray, diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis) can be performed after taking these initial steps. 

Option B (Echocardiogram) would be incorrect because although he does have a murmur, there is no indication that he has endocarditis or any kind of cardiac condition that would require an echo at this time. 

Option C (Bronchoscopy) would be incorrect because bronchoscopy is typically used for cases where invasive diagnostic tests are needed such as in immunocompromised patients, or patients with suspicion of lung cancer or foreign body. 

Option D (CT scan of the chest) could be useful later to evaluate for complications (eg, abscess, empyema) if the patient does not improve as expected, but it should not delay initial resuscitation and antibiotic administration.

Option E (Chest X-ray) could be useful to confirm the diagnosis of pneumonia and effusion but again, it should not delay initial resuscitation and antibiotic administration. In fact, if a severe infection is suspected, such as in this case, antibiotics should be started even before imaging is done. 

So, the most appropriate next step in this scenario would be Option A - Administer intravenous levofloxacin."
774,"This patient's presentation and laboratory values suggest acute alcoholic hepatitis. This condition is typically seen in chronic, heavy alcohol users and may present with jaundice, hepatomegaly, fever, and a diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. The AST and ALT are markedly elevated, with AST generally greater than ALT, and the PT and PTT are both prolonged. Five days later, the patient's neurological status has improved, and his laboratory values show a decrease in AST and ALT, along with a decrease in PT and aPTT. This suggests that the patient is recovering from acute alcoholic hepatitis, so the correct answer is 'A': Recovery from acute alcoholic liver disease.

Option 'B': Recovery from ischemic liver disease, is incorrect because ischemic liver disease would present with severe right upper quadrant pain and a more sudden and symmetric elevation in transaminases (AST and ALT). This patient does not have any symptoms of ischemic liver disease.

Option 'C': Recovery from acute renal failure, is incorrect because the patient's renal function (as measured by BUN and creatinine) did not dramatically improve over the 5-day period. While the creatinine slightly decreased, it is still elevated, indicating ongoing renal impairment.

Option 'D': Acute renal failure, is also incorrect because the patient's renal function did not worsen over the course of 5 days.

Option 'E': Fulminant liver failure, is incorrect because this condition would present with rapid onset of severe hepatic dysfunction, including jaundice, coagulopathy, and encephalopathy, typically within 8 weeks of the onset of symptoms. This patient has not shown signs of encephalopathy (altered mental status, confusion), and his liver function has improved over 5 days.","stop","this suggests that the patient is recovering from acute alcoholic hepatitis, so the correct answer is 'a': recovery from acute alcoholic liver disease.","A","E","USMLE question: A 45-year-old homeless man is brought to the emergency department by the police.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's history of alcohol abuse and the initial presentation of elevated liver enzymes and coagulation factors (increased PT and aPTT) are consistent with acute alcoholic hepatitis, a condition characterized by hepatocellular damage and inflammation. The hospital course is notable for improvement in liver enzyme levels, which suggests recovery from acute alcoholic liver disease (choice A). Other indicators of improvement include the decrease in the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, which were initially prolonged due to impaired hepatic synthesis of clotting factors.

Choice B (Recovery from ischemic liver disease) is incorrect because ischemic liver disease (shock liver) would typically present with a more severe rise in aminotransferase levels (typically >1000 U/L) and improve with correction of the underlying hemodynamic instability.

Choice C (Recovery from acute renal failure) is incorrect as the patient's renal function, as measured by serum creatinine, remains relatively unchanged from the initial presentation.

Choice D (Acute renal failure) is incorrect because this patient's creatinine has not significantly changed over the course of his hospitalization. 

Choice E (Fulminant liver failure) is incorrect because, although this patient initially presented with elevated liver enzymes and coagulation factors, both have improved over the course of his hospitalization. Fulminant liver failure would not demonstrate this pattern of improvement."
778,"The most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms is 'A: Anemia of chronic disease', also known as anemia of inflammation.

This patient's fatigue, palpitations, and pallor are likely due to anemia. Her symmetric, morning-dominant joint pain and congestion suggest a recent upper respiratory tract infection, which could have triggered an autoimmune response resulting in anemia of chronic disease. This is the second most common type of anemia, typically seen in patients with chronic illnesses like infections, cancer, or autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. The pathogenesis involves inflammatory cytokines interfering with iron metabolism, leading to iron-restricted erythropoiesis and a mild to moderate decrease in hemoglobin.

Option B: EBV infection typically causes infectious mononucleosis, characterized by fever, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, and atypical lymphocytosis, which are not present in this patient.
Option C: A mutation in ankyrin, a protein responsible for maintaining the shape of red blood cells, would result in hereditary spherocytosis, which typically presents with hemolytic anemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly in childhood, not matching this patient's presentation.
Option D: Although rheumatoid arthritis may explain the joint pain, it does not account for the patient's anemia and fatigue. Rheumatoid arthritis could lead to anemia of chronic disease, but the joint symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis would not resolve without treatment as in this patient.
Option E: A substitution of glutamic acid with valine at the beta chain of the hemoglobin molecule would result in sickle cell disease, characterized by episodic painful crises, hemolytic anemia, and splenic infarcts, which does not match this patient's presentation.","stop","","A","C","USMLE question: A 29-year-old woman comes to the clinic for complaints of fatigue and palpitations for the past 3 days.

She denies any previous episodes but does endorse symmetric joint pain of her hands, wrists, knees, and ankles that was worse in the morning over the past week that self-resolved.

Option: {'A': 'Anemia of chronic disease', 'B': 'Infection with Ebstein-Barr virus', 'C': 'Mutation of ankyrin', 'D': 'Rheumatoid arthritis', 'E': 'Substitution of glutamic acid with valine at the beta chain'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The patient's presentation is suggestive of an acute hemolytic anemia following a recent infection, most likely due to Parvovirus B19. The most common cause of erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) in children, Parvovirus B19 can cause aplastic crises in patients with chronic hemolytic anemias and pure red cell aplasia in immunocompromised patients. In immunocompetent adults, however, parvovirus B19 can precipitate acute, self-limited hemolytic anemia. The virus, which has a predilection for erythroid progenitor cells, causes temporary arrest of erythropoiesis that can lead to anemia in patients with a high turnover rate of red blood cells. Symptoms of anemia may include fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and pallor. The patient's recent upper respiratory infection symptoms and symmetric polyarthropathy (most commonly involving the small joints of the hands and feet) suggest recent infection with Parvovirus B19. So, the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms is an infection with Ebstein-Barr virus (option B).

Option A (Anemia of chronic disease) is incorrect as it typically presents in patients with chronic illnesses like cancer, autoimmune conditions, or chronic kidney disease. There is no indication that this patient has such a history.

Option C (Mutation of ankyrin) is incorrect as it is associated with hereditary spherocytosis, a condition that would present with chronic hemolytic anemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly, not acute symptoms.

Option D (Rheumatoid arthritis) is incorrect because although this patient has joint pain, there is no evidence of chronic inflammatory joint disease which is typical for RA. Also, rheumatoid arthritis does not typically cause anemia.

Option E (Substitution of glutamic acid with valine at the beta chain) is incorrect as this results in sickle cell disease, a chronic condition that presents much earlier in life and is characterized by painful crises, not the symptoms this patient shows."
782,"The correct answer is 'C: Initiate an ARB.'

This patient's presentation is highly suggestive of angioedema, which is a well-known side effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors like captopril. It occurs because ACE inhibitors also inhibit the breakdown of bradykinin, leading to increased levels of bradykinin which is a potent vasodilator, causing increased vascular permeability and leading to angioedema. This complication is more common in African Americans.

In this case, the best next step in management is to discontinue the ACE inhibitor (which has already been done) and switch to an alternative class of medication, such as an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) as these do not increase bradykinin levels and thus do not carry the risk of inducing angioedema.

'A: Reinitiate captopril' is incorrect because this patient has already demonstrated a severe allergic reaction to this medication. 

'B: Switch to ramipril' is incorrect because ramipril is also an ACE inhibitor, and would likely cause a similar reaction.

'D: Initiate a beta-blocker' is incorrect because beta-blockers are not first-line therapy for hypertension in most patients.

'E: Initiate a thiazide diuretic' is incorrect because although thiazide diuretics are a reasonable choice for initial therapy for hypertension, in this case, an ARB would be a more appropriate choice given this patient's intolerance to ACE inhibitors.","stop","the correct answer is 'c: initiate an arb.'","C","E","USMLE question: A 71-year-old African American man diagnosed with high blood pressure presents to the outpatient clinic.

He presents back shortly after initiation with extremely swollen lips, tongue, and face. After captopril is discontinued, what is the most appropriate step for the management of his high blood pressure?

This patient has developed angioedema, a rare but serious side effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors like captopril. Angioedema involves the swelling of the deeper layers of the skin and can be life-threatening when it affects the airway. ACE inhibitors are more likely to cause angioedema in African American patients, and should be avoided in patients who have experienced this reaction.

Option A is incorrect because reinitiating captopril would likely lead to the recurrence of angioedema.

Option B is incorrect because ramipril is also an ACE inhibitor and would likely cause the same reaction.

Option D is incorrect because beta-blockers are not the first-line treatment for hypertension, especially in older adults and African Americans who respond better to diuretics and calcium channel blockers.

Option E may be effective, but ACE inhibitors and ARBs are generally preferred because they have been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke in patients with hypertension. If the patient cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor due to angioedema, an ARB is the most appropriate alternative because it provides similar benefits without the same risk of angioedema."
786,"This patient's polyuria, polydipsia, and hypernatremia (serum sodium >145 mEq/L) with inappropriately low urine osmolality (<300 mOsm/kg H2O) suggest central diabetes insipidus (DI). Central DI is caused by a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) due to destruction of the hypothalamic osmoreceptors or the posterior pituitary. In this patient, the most likely etiology is hypothalamic damage due to the recent head trauma. The elevated serum ADH level suggests that the damage is localized to the hypothalamic osmoreceptors (which regulate ADH secretion) rather than the posterior pituitary (which stores and releases ADH) (choice A).

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (choice B) is a life-threatening condition characterized by fever, altered mental status, autonomic dysfunction, and generalized muscle rigidity after administration of antipsychotic medications. This patient has no such history.

Paraneoplastic syndromes (choice C) can present with a variety of neurologic symptoms, but they would not explain this patient's hypernatremia and urine findings.

Primary hyperaldosteronism (choice D) leads to sodium retention and hypertension but would not cause the polyuria, polydipsia, and hypernatremia seen in this patient.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's polyuria, polydipsia, hypernatremia, and high serum anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) with low urine osmolality are suggestive of central diabetes insipidus (CDI), most likely due to a hypothalamic injury (Choice A). CDI is characterized by deficient ADH secretion, often due to damage to the hypothalamus or posterior pituitary. The head trauma this patient suffered could have resulted in a hypothalamic injury, leading to CDI. CDI leads to an inability to concentrate urine, resulting in excessive urination (polyuria) and excessive thirst (polydipsia). Despite the high levels of ADH in the blood, if the kidney does not respond to it, this can also indicate nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. However, in this patient's case the head trauma makes CDI the more likely diagnosis.

B. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a life-threatening neurological disorder most often caused by an adverse reaction to neuroleptic or antipsychotic drugs. It typically presents with fever, autonomic dysfunction, altered mental status, and generalized muscle rigidity. This patient's symptoms do not align with this syndrome.

C. Paraneoplastic syndromes are a group of rare disorders that are triggered by an altered immune system response to a neoplasm. They are defined as clinical syndromes involving nonmetastatic systemic effects that accompany malignant disease. This patient does not have symptoms suggestive of a malignancy.

D. Primary hyperaldosteronism, or Conn's syndrome, is characterized by hypertension, hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. These are caused by the overproduction of aldosterone by the adrenal glands. This patient's symptoms do not align with this condition.

E. Mood stabilizers, such as lithium, can cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, which is characterized by polyuria and polydipsia. However, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus typically presents with resistance to ADH in the kidneys, leading to low serum levels of ADH, not high levels as seen in this patient. 

Therefore, the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms is hypothalamic injury."
796,"The answer is D: Genetic testing.

The patient's presentation is consistent with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). This is an acquired stem cell disorder that results in a deficiency of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), which anchors several proteins to the cell membrane. The most clinically relevant GPI-anchored protein is decay-accelerating factor (DAF) which inhibits the complement system on cell surfaces. DAF deficiency makes erythrocytes susceptible to complement-mediated lysis, leading to intravascular hemolysis, one of the main clinical features of PNH. Hemolysis leads to hemoglobinemia, hemoglobinuria (red urine, especially noticeable after periods of relative ischemia such as sleep or strenuous exercise), and hemosiderinuria. Other findings can include smooth muscle dystonia causing esophageal spasm and erectile dysfunction, and thrombosis, which is the most common cause of death in PNH and most often involves hepatic, abdominal, and cerebral veins. Diagnosis is made by flow cytometry, which can detect the absence of GPI-linked proteins on cells.

Option A: A peripheral blood smear may show schistocytes (fragmented RBCs), but this is not specific and could be seen in many other conditions, such as DIC or TTP.

Option B: Although flow cytometry is used in the diagnosis of PNH, it is not the most definitive test. Genetic testing (option D) is more definitive.

Option C: Hemoglobin electrophoresis would be used to diagnose conditions such as sickle cell disease or thalassemia, not PNH.

Option E: Sucrose hemolysis test is a screening test for PNH, but it is less sensitive and specific than flow cytometry.","stop","the answer is d: genetic testing.","D","B","USMLE question: A 35-year-old man presents with acute onset of chest pain, trouble breathing, and abdominal pain.

However, after completing a particularly difficult workout over this last weekend he noticed left-sided chest pain that did not radiate, and abdominal pain, worse on the right side. The pain persisted after he stopped exercising. This morning he noticed red urine. The patient reports similar past episodes of red urine after intense exercise or excessive alcohol intake for the past 5 years, but says it has never been accompanied by pain. Past medical history is significant for a urinary tract infection last week, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Physical examination is significant for a systolic flow murmur loudest at the right upper sternal border and right upper quadrant tenderness without guarding or rebound. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:
Hemoglobin 8.5 g/dL

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is D: Genetic testing.

This patient's fatigue, chest pain, abdominal pain, red urine, and lab findings are concerning for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a rare acquired stem cell disorder that results in a defective DAF (CD55) and MIRL (CD59) complement regulators. This makes erythrocytes sensitive to complement, leading to intravascular hemolysis and explaining this patient's anemia, elevated bilirubin, and low haptoglobin. Hemoglobinuria explains the red urine, especially after episodes of physiologic or oxidative stress (eg, excessive exercise or alcohol intake). The absence of CD55 and CD59 on cells other than erythrocytes can lead to platelet activation and a hypercoagulable state, explaining this patient's hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome). The definitive diagnostic test for PNH is flow cytometry to assess the absence of CD55 and CD59 on erythrocytes (option B is incorrect) but this is not usually tested in USMLE questions. Instead, a high-yield fact for USMLE is that the most likely next step in the diagnosis of PNH is genetic testing to confirm the PIG-A mutation that causes the disease.

Option A: A peripheral blood smear might show signs of hemolysis (eg, schistocytes), but it's not as specific or sensitive for PNH as genetic testing.
Option C: Hemoglobin electrophoresis is used to diagnose conditions like sickle cell disease or thalassemia, and wouldn't help diagnose PNH.
Option E: Sucrose hemolysis test was formerly used as a screening test for PNH, but it has been largely replaced by flow cytometry and genetic testing due to their superior sensitivity and specificity."
799,"This patient's unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and the fact that his condition became apparent during times of stress (gastroenteritis) is suggestive of Gilbert syndrome, which is characterized by a benign, mild, intermittent unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Gilbert syndrome is due to decreased activity of the enzyme glucuronyltransferase, which is responsible for the conjugation of bilirubin in the liver. This condition is usually asymptomatic, but jaundice may become apparent during times of illness, stress, or fasting. The molecular basis for Gilbert syndrome is mutations in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene (choice C), which reduce the expression of the UGT1A1 enzyme.

A deletion in the SLCO1B1 gene (choice A) is associated with Rotor syndrome, a rare, benign condition characterized by direct (conjugated) hyperbilirubinemia. A silent mutation in the UGT1A1 gene (choice B) would not alter the amino acid sequence of the glucuronyltransferase enzyme, and therefore would not be expected to cause Gilbert syndrome. A missense mutation in the UGT1A1 gene (choice D) could theoretically cause Gilbert syndrome if it resulted in an amino acid substitution that decreased enzyme activity, but this is not the typical cause of Gilbert syndrome.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's sudden onset of jaundice following a period of decreased oral intake is suggestive of Gilbert syndrome, which is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by recurrent episodes of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that often present during periods of fasting or illness. It is caused by reduced activity of the enzyme responsible for the conjugation of bilirubin, uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT). This is due to a mutation (often a dinucleotide repeat) in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene (choice C) that decreases gene transcription. Other mutations in the UGT1A1 gene can also occur but are less common.

Phenobarbital is used to treat this condition by increasing liver enzyme synthesis, including UGT, which can help to increase the conversion of unconjugated to conjugated bilirubin.

Deletion in the SLCO1B1 gene (choice A) can lead to Rotor syndrome, a benign autosomal recessive condition characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Silent mutation (choice B), missense mutation (choice D), and nonsense mutation (choice E) in the UGT1A1 gene can cause Crigler-Najjar syndrome, which is a much more severe disease characterized by persistent, non-transient unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. This condition can lead to kernicterus if not treated promptly."
802,"The patient's chronic kidney disease (as indicated by an elevated creatinine level), hyperkalemia, hypertension, and peripheral neuropathy are suggestive of longstanding diabetes mellitus. Indeed, unrecognized diabetes is common and can present with any of these complications. Diabetic kidney disease typically manifests as albuminuria and progresses to overt proteinuria and a decrease in glomerular filtration rate. Longstanding hyperglycemia leads to nonenzymatic glycosylation of vascular basement membranes and the production of advanced glycosylation end products, which contribute to both microvascular and macrovascular disease.

The patient's severe hand pain and difficulty manipulating objects are suggestive of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), another common condition in patients with diabetes. CTS results from chronic compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist. Symptoms include pain and paresthesias in the distribution of the median nerve (thumb, index, middle, and lateral fourth fingers). Patients may also report nocturnal symptoms, clumsiness, or difficulty with fine motor activities (eg, buttoning a shirt, using keys). Longstanding diabetes can result in peripheral neuropathy and an increased propensity for nerve compression.

In a hypertensive patient with diabetes, the first-line treatment is an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. These agents are renal protective as they reduce intraglomerular pressure, leading to a slower decline in glomerular filtration rate. The choice of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers does not depend on the baseline level of proteinuria, as these drugs have been shown to delay the progression of kidney disease in patients with diabetes and hypertension even in the absence of proteinuria. 

Hence, the correct answer is A: 'Captopril', an ACE inhibitor.

The other options are incorrect because:

Option B: 'Furosemide' (a loop diuretic) is used in the management of volume overload in heart failure and is not first line in diabetic nephropathy. 

Option C: 'Hydrochlorothiazide' (a thiazide diuretic) is a good antihypertensive but does not have the renal protective effects of an ACE inhibitor. 

Option D: 'Labetalol' (a non-selective beta blocker and alpha-1 receptor blocker) is effective in treating hypertension but does not have the renal protective effects of an ACE inhibitor.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's hypercalcemia, renal failure, and metabolic acidosis suggest chronic kidney disease (CKD), likely secondary to longstanding hypertension suggested by her high blood pressure at presentation. Chronic hyperkalemia seen in CKD can decrease neuromuscular excitability and cause muscle weakness and paralysis. Calcium gluconate, insulin, and glucose can be given to lower potassium acutely, and dialysis can be used for severe cases, as in this patient. However, it is important to prevent recurrence of hyperkalemia in CKD. Potassium retention in CKD is primarily due to decreased renal potassium excretion. The most effective way to increase renal potassium excretion is to increase distal sodium delivery, which can be accomplished with a loop diuretic (choice B). The increased distal sodium concentration enhances potassium secretion by increasing the electrical gradient driving force for potassium efflux.

A: ACE inhibitors like captopril are a cornerstone of CKD management as they reduce proteinuria and slow glomerular injury. However, ACE inhibitors can increase potassium levels by reducing aldosterone secretion and are thus not the best choice in a patient with hyperkalemia.

C: Thiazide diuretics like hydrochlorothiazide are not as efficacious in patients with decreased renal function (glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min).

D: Beta-blockers like labetalol can be used for blood pressure control in CKD but do not have the potassium-lowering effects of loop diuretics.

E: Calcium channel blockers like nifedipine can be used for blood pressure control in CKD but do not have the potassium-lowering effects of loop diuretics."
804,"The correct answer is D. Transesophageal echocardiography. 

The clinical presentation of this patient, who is an intravenous drug user with a new murmur and persistent fever despite antibiotic therapy, suggests the diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE). Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), is the most common cause of IE in intravenous drug users. 

The modified Duke criteria are used for the diagnosis of IE and include a combination of major criteria (ie, positive blood cultures for typical IE organisms, evidence of endocardial involvement) and minor criteria (eg, predisposing condition, fever, vascular phenomena, immunologic phenomena, microbiologic evidence). The best way to visualize vegetations in patients with suspected IE is transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), which is superior to transthoracic echocardiography in the diagnosis of IE due to higher sensitivity (90%-100% vs 50%-70%). 

Option A (CT scan of the chest) would not be indicated in this patient because the fever and new murmur are more suggestive of infective endocarditis than a pulmonary process.

Option B (Nafcillin and piperacillin-tazobactam) would not be the appropriate antibiotic choice for a MRSA infection. 

Option C (Obtain new blood cultures) may be done after initiating appropriate antibiotic therapy to determine if bacteremia persists, but the priority in this case would be to visualize the valve to confirm diagnosis. 

Option E (Vancomycin and gentamicin) could potentially be used for MRSA, however, the persistence of fever despite antibiotic therapy to which the organism is sensitive suggests that the infection source has not been adequately addressed. It points towards a need for diagnostic imaging (TEE) rather than a change in antibiotics.","stop","the correct answer is d. transesophageal echocardiography.","D","D","USMLE question: A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department with weakness and a fever for the past week.

IE, especially in IV drug users, can be caused by Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which is resistant to nafcillin and sensitive to vancomycin. 

Given that the patient is not improving despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, the concern becomes whether there is a cardiac complication of endocarditis, such as an abscess, valvular perforation, or other structural abnormality. TEE is indicated in this situation, as it is more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) for detecting these complications.

Option A: A CT scan of the chest is not the best next step because it would not provide the necessary detail to identify possible cardiac complications of IE.

Option B: Nafcillin and piperacillin-tazobactam would not be effective against MRSA, which this patient's cultures have revealed.

Option C: Obtain new blood cultures is not the best next step because the organism has already been identified and is sensitive to the antibiotics the patient is receiving.

814,"The answer is B: Neonatal ingestion of formula with high phosphate load.

This neonate's generalized seizures, irritability, and respiratory distress are likely due to severe hypocalcemia, defined as a serum calcium concentration <7 mg/dL (<1.75 mmol/L). Neonatal hypocalcemia is categorized as early onset (<72 hours after birth) or late onset (>72 hours). Early onset hypocalcemia usually occurs in infants who are preterm, small for gestational age, or born to diabetic mothers due to a relative delay in parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. Late onset hypocalcemia typically occurs in full-term infants on day 4-7 of life. High phosphate intake (eg, due to cow milk-based formulas or phosphate-containing medications) is a common cause. The high phosphate load can cause hypocalcemia by decreasing calcium absorption from the gut and increasing calcium precipitation in bone. The elevated PTH concentration reflects an appropriate response to the low serum calcium concentration.

Option A is incorrect, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a rare autosomal dominant condition characterized by lifelong elevations in serum calcium and PTH levels with relative hypocalciuria.

Option C is incorrect, neonatal hypoglycemia typically presents in the first 24 hours of life. Symptoms can include jitteriness, seizures, and poor feeding but these would typically resolve with glucose administration.

Option D is incorrect, neonatal hyperthyroidism would present with symptoms like tachycardia, irritability, and poor weight gain but wouldn't cause hypocalcemia.

Option E is incorrect, maternal opioid abuse can cause neonatal abstinence syndrome, presenting with signs of central nervous system hyperirritability, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and autonomic signs, but this doesn't typically involve hypocalcemia.","stop","the answer is b: neonatal ingestion of formula with high phosphate load.","B","A","USMLE question: Three days after delivery, a 4000-g (8.8-lb) male newborn has several episodes of right-sided arm and leg twitching and lip smacking. These shaking episodes have occurred about six times over the last hour and have lasted for about 40 seconds. He has also had rapid breathing and poor feeding. He has not had fever or trauma. He was born at 37 weeks' gestation. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. There is no family history of serious illness. His temperature is 37Ã?Â°C (98.6Ã?Â°F), pulse is 230/min, and respirations are 70/min. He appears irritable and jittery. There are intermittent spasms present. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a serum calcium concentration of 6 mg/dL and a serum parathyroid hormone concentration of 150 pg/mL. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?
Option: {'A': 'Maternal familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia', 'B': 'Neonatal ingestion of formula with high phosphate load', 'C': 'Neonatal hypoglycemia', 'D': 'Increased neonatal thyroid hormone secretion', 'E': 'Maternal opioid abuse during pregnancy'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's seizures, irritability, jitteriness, and high parathyroid hormone (PTH) level can be explained by neonatal hypocalcemia, which most often occurs in the first 48-72 hours of life. Neonatal hypocalcemia can be asymptomatic or may present with nonspecific signs (eg, poor feeding, jitteriness, high-pitched cry) or more severe neuromuscular irritability (eg, tremors, seizures). PTH attempts to increase the serum calcium level by stimulating bone resorption and renal calcium reabsorption.

Neonatal hypocalcemia is classified as early onset (within 72 hours of life) or late onset (beyond 72 hours of life). Early-onset hypocalcemia is usually transient and often reflects maternal diabetes or prematurity, conditions that can impair PTH response and/or target organ sensitivity to PTH. Late-onset hypocalcemia (Option B) is usually secondary to dietary consumption of formula high in phosphate, which binds calcium and decreases its serum concentration, or it is due to hypomagnesemia, which impairs PTH secretion and end-organ responsiveness.

Option A (Maternal familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia) is a benign condition that would not result in symptomatic neonatal hypocalcemia.
Option C (Neonatal hypoglycemia) can cause seizures but would not explain the elevated PTH level.
Option D (Increased neonatal thyroid hormone secretion) would present with symptoms such as hyperactivity, poor weight gain, and tachycardia. It would not cause hypocalcemia or elevated PTH.
Option E (Maternal opioid abuse during pregnancy) can cause a neonatal abstinence syndrome characterized by irritability, high-pitched crying, and seizures, but it would not result in hypocalcemia or elevated PTH. 

So, the correct answer is B: Neonatal ingestion of formula with high phosphate load. This is likely causing the hypocalcemia and consequent elevated PTH in this patient."
817,"This patient's decreased blood pressure, elevated jugular venous pressure, and bilateral pitting ankle edema suggest a diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure with cardiogenic shock. Positive inotropic agents (eg, dobutamine, milrinone) increase cardiac contractility, which, in turn, increases stroke volume, leading to increased cardiac output and blood pressure. This is often beneficial in heart failure, in which contractility is decreased. An increased stroke volume results in a decrease in the left ventricular end-systolic volume (the volume of blood in the ventricle after systole). Therefore, the answer is option C: 'An increase in the left ventricular end-systolic volume' would not be the expected result of adding an inotropic agent. 

Option A, 'A decrease in the systemic vascular resistance,' is incorrect because inotropic agents do not primarily act on the systemic vasculature to decrease resistance. 

Option B, 'A decrease in the interval between the heart sounds S1 and S2,' and Option D, 'A decrease in the interval between the heart sounds S2 and S1,' are incorrect because heart sounds are not directly affected by inotropic agents.

Option E, 'A decrease in the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure,' is incorrect because increased contractility and stroke volume from inotropic agents can decrease left ventricular end-diastolic volume, but not necessarily the end-diastolic pressure. End-diastolic pressure is more related to the compliance or stiffness of the ventricle, which is not directly affected by inotropic agents.","stop","therefore, the answer is option c: 'an increase in the left ventricular end-systolic volume' would not be the expected result of adding an inotropic agent.","C","B","USMLE question: A 66-year-old male presents to the emergency room with shortness of breath with exertion and at rest for the past 5 days.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is A: A decrease in the systemic vascular resistance.

The patient in this scenario is presenting with signs and symptoms of decompensated heart failure. Decompensated heart failure is typically managed with diuretics, vasodilators, and inotropic agents. Inotropic agents such as dobutamine work by increasing the contractility of the heart, thus increasing cardiac output. This results in a decrease in systemic vascular resistance through the decrease in the afterload. This is why option A is the correct answer.

Option B and D suggest a change in the interval between heart sounds S1 and S2, and between S2 and S1, respectively. Inotropes do not directly affect the timing of heart sounds. Heart sounds are generated by the closing of heart valves, which is more related to the structure and function of the valves rather than the contractility of the heart.

Option C suggests an increase in the left ventricular end-systolic volume. This is incorrect because inotropic agents increase the contractility of the heart, which would actually decrease the left ventricular end-systolic volume because more blood is being pumped out of the heart.

Option E suggests a decrease in the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. While inotropes can indirectly affect end-diastolic pressures by improving cardiac output and therefore reducing preload, it is not the primary effect of inotropic agents. In addition, in a failing heart, the end-diastolic pressure may actually increase due to impaired relaxation and increased end-diastolic volume. Therefore, it is not the best answer to this question."

Tertiary syphilis can have several manifestations, one of which is neurosyphilis, which can present many years after the initial infection. Neurosyphilis can have both asymptomatic and symptomatic forms. Symptomatic neurosyphilis can be further categorized into meningovascular (eg, stroke symptoms), general paresis (eg, personality changes, hyperreflexia, Argyll Robertson pupils), and tabes dorsalis.

Tabes dorsalis results from demyelination of the dorsal columns and roots, leading to impaired proprioception and vibratory sense.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The patient's history of increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, decreased libido, and physical exam findings of small testes and skin hyperpigmentation are consistent with a diagnosis of hemochromatosis, a disorder of iron metabolism. Iron deposition can occur in many tissues including liver, pancreas, skin (causing the hyperpigmentation), testes (leading to hypogonadism as seen in this patient), and heart. The cardiac deposition can lead to dilated or restrictive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, and heart failure. So the cardiovascular structure at greatest risk of damage in this patient is the Cardiac conduction system (Choice D). 

Choice A and B - The pulmonary valve and cardiac septum are not typically involved in hemochromatosis.
Choice C - Coronary artery disease can occur in hemochromatosis, but it is due to the associated diabetes and not from iron deposition in the coronary arteries. 
Choice E - Temporal artery is involved in a condition known as temporal (giant cell) arteritis, which is a form of vasculitis. It's not commonly associated with hemochromatosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is the Cardiac conduction system (Choice D)."
857,"The correct answer is C: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). 

In patients with cirrhosis and gastrointestinal bleeding from esophageal varices, the first step in management is resuscitation and stabilization followed by endoscopic therapy to control the bleeding. For primary prevention of variceal bleeding in patients with moderate to large varices, non-selective beta-blockers (eg, propranolol, nadolol) or endoscopic variceal ligation is recommended. For secondary prevention (ie, to prevent rebleeding), the combination of non-selective beta-blockers and endoscopic variceal ligation is recommended.

However, despite optimal therapy, some patients continue to have rebleeding episodes. In these patients, and in those who are not candidates for or do not respond to pharmacologic and endoscopic therapy (eg, because of contraindications, side effects, or persistent bleeding), placement of a TIPS can reduce portal pressure and prevent further bleeding. TIPS is a procedure that creates a low-resistance channel between the hepatic vein and the intrahepatic portion of the portal vein, thereby bypassing the liver and reducing portal venous pressure. TIPS can effectively control acute variceal bleeding when other measures fail, and can also prevent variceal rebleeding. 

Option A, Octreotide therapy, is used in acute variceal bleeding to reduce portal venous pressure and can help control bleeding until definitive therapy (eg, endoscopy) can be performed, but there is no evidence that it reduces rebleeding or improves survival on a long-term basis. 
Option B, Terlipressin, is a vasopressin analog that can also be used in acute variceal bleeding, but similar to octreotide, does not provide any long-term benefit in preventing rebleeding. 
Option D, Variceal sclerotherapy, is no longer commonly used due to higher rates of rebleeding and complications compared to endoscopic variceal ligation. 
Option E, Variceal ligation, has already been done in this patient, but this alone is often not enough for secondary prevention of variceal bleeding.","stop","the correct answer is c: transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (tips).","C","E","USMLE question: A 54-year-old man with alcoholism comes to the emergency department because of vomiting blood for 6 hours.

On arrival, his temperature is 37.3Ã?Â°C (99.1Ã?Â°F), pulse is 134/min, and blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. He is resuscitated with 0.9% saline and undergoes an emergency upper endoscopy, which shows actively bleeding varices. Band ligation of the varices is done and hemostasis is achieved. He is diagnosed with Child class B cirrhosis. He is concerned about the possibility of recurrence of such an episode. He is asked to abstain from alcohol, to which he readily agrees. In addition to non-selective beta-blocker therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation to prevent future morbidity and mortality from this condition?

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The most appropriate recommendation to prevent future morbidity and mortality from this condition is 'C' Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). 

In patients with cirrhosis, gastroesophageal varices develop secondary to portal hypertension. Once varices have bled, they are at high risk of rebleeding, which carries substantial morbidity and mortality. Strategies to prevent variceal rebleeding include medical therapy (eg, nonselective beta-blockers) and endoscopic band ligation. TIPS is recommended in patients who have rebleeding while on combined medical and endoscopic therapy or who are not candidates for these therapies.

Octreotide (option A) and terlipressin (option B) are used to decrease portal venous pressure acutely and would not be typically used as a long-term preventative measure. 

Variceal sclerotherapy (option D) and ligation (option E) are used to treat active bleeding, but in the setting of varices with a high risk of rebleeding, TIPS is typically the recommended preventative therapy. 

In this patient with alcohol-induced cirrhosis who has had a bleeding episode from esophageal varices, in addition to abstinence from alcohol and nonselective beta-blockers, TIPS would be the most appropriate recommendation to prevent future morbidity and mortality from this condition."
866,"This elderly postoperative patient with fever, confusion, abdominal pain, and leukocytosis likely has intraabdominal sepsis. His lactic acidosis indicates that his tissues are hypoperfused despite a normal blood pressure, suggesting early septic shock. A common cause of intraabdominal sepsis in the postoperative period is anastomotic leak, which can lead to peritonitis and abscess formation (Option E). Anastomotic leaks typically present several days after surgery and can be subtle, with symptoms including fever, confusion (especially in elderly), and abdominal pain.

Option A (Wound contamination) is incorrect because, despite his recent surgery, this patient's surgical wound is not erythematous, swollen, or tender, all of which would suggest wound infection.

Option B (Impaired alveolar ventilation) can cause hypoxemia and hypercapnia, leading to respiratory acidosis. However, this patient's lactic acidosis indicates tissue hypoperfusion, likely due to sepsis.

Option C (Peritoneal inflammation) is seen in conditions such as peritonitis, but the question is asking for the underlying mechanism, which in this case is likely intraabdominal abscess formation due to an anastomotic leak.

Option: {'A': 'Wound contamination', 'B': 'Impaired alveolar ventilation', 'C': 'Peritoneal inflammation', 'D': 'Bladder outlet obstruction', 'E': 'Intraabdominal abscess formation'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is C. 'Peritoneal inflammation'. 

This patient's postoperative fever, lethargy, abdominal distension, and tenderness suggest peritonitis secondary to an intraabdominal source such as a biloma, abscess, or secondary peritonitis from bowel perforation or leak of intestinal contents. These conditions can result from direct surgical injury (eg, bile duct injury, bowel perforation), postoperative anastomotic leak, spillage of gallstones into the peritoneal cavity during surgery, or ischemic injury from hypotension, hypoxemia, or sepsis. 

The significantly increased lactic acid level is indicative of tissue hypoperfusion, which commonly occurs in intraabdominal sepsis due to redistribution of blood flow away from the splanchnic circulation. 

Option A, 'Wound contamination', is less likely as the incision site appears dry and non-erythematous, with no signs of local infection. 

Option B,'Impaired alveolar ventilation', while plausible due to his history of COPD and wheezing, is not the primary issue here. His respiratory rate is normal and there's no evidence of respiratory failure. 

Option D,'Bladder outlet obstruction', could have led to urinary retention and subsequent infection, but this would not account for his abdomen distention. 

Lastly, option E, 'Intraabdominal abscess formation', is a possibility but less likely than peritonitis given the short period since surgery. Abscess formation typically takes longer to develop."
870,"The clinical picture is suggestive of histoplasmosis, a fungal infection often associated with exposure to bird or bat droppings. Thus, the correct answer would be E: 'Exposure to bat droppings'. Histoplasmosis is endemic to the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys but can be found worldwide. It is often associated with activities that disturb soil, especially soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings. The fungus, Histoplasma capsulatum, exists in two forms. In the soil, it is a mold that produces infectious spores. Once inhaled into the lung, the spores transform into yeasts and survive within macrophages, as seen on the lung biopsy. The yeast form has a characteristic appearance with narrow-based budding and surrounding clear space (halo).

'A: Treatment with inhaled glucocorticoids' - this could predispose to fungal infections, but the case does not suggest an iatrogenic cause. 

'B: Visit to Arizona desert' - Coccidioidomycosis, another fungal infection, is endemic to the desert regions of the southwestern United States, including Arizona. It presents similarly to histoplasmosis, but the fungal forms seen on biopsy would be different (spherules filled with endospores).

'C: Recent trip to Brazil' - Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic fungal infection endemic to Latin America, but its characteristic microscopic finding is a ""pilot's wheel"" arrangement of yeast cells, which is not described here.

'D: Previous mycobacterial infection' - While a previous mycobacterial infection could potentially cause granulomas and even lung nodules, it would not explain the current acute symptoms or the finding of yeasts within macrophages.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is B. 'Visit to Arizona desert'. 

This patient's symptoms are suggestive of Coccidioidomycosis, a fungal infection caused by Coccidioides immitis or Coccidioides posadasii. These fungi are endemic in the southwestern United States, especially in Arizona and California deserts, where they exist in the soil. The disease is contracted by inhalation of airborne arthroconidia that are spread by wind or dust storms. The symptoms are very similar to those of pneumonia, including fever, cough, chest pain, and malaise. The hilar lymphadenopathy and well-defined lung nodules seen in the chest x-ray are also characteristic of this infection. The basophilic, crescent-shaped nuclei with pericellular halos found within macrophages are consistent with the spherules of Coccidioides spp. The presence of a polysaccharide antigen in the urine confirms the diagnosis.

Option A: Glucocorticoid treatment does not typically cause these symptoms or findings. 

Option C: A recent trip to Brazil would be more suggestive of diseases endemic to that region, such as Yellow Fever, Dengue, or Chagas Disease rather than Coccidioidomycosis.

Option D: A previous mycobacterial infection, such as tuberculosis, could cause similar symptoms, but the finding of the crescent-shaped nuclei and polysaccharide antigen in the urine is not consistent with this diagnosis.

Option E: Exposure to bat droppings would be suggestive of Histoplasmosis, which is caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, a different type of fungus."
885,"The axillary nerve is most likely to be damaged in this patient with a fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus. The axillary nerve innervates the deltoid muscle and the teres minor muscle, and provides sensory innervation to the skin overlying the deltoid (the ""regimental badge area""). Therefore, the correct answer is 'B' Teres minor.

Now let's discuss why the other options are wrong:

Option 'A': Infraspinatus muscle is innervated by the suprascapular nerve, not the axillary nerve.
Option 'C': Supraspinatus muscle is also innervated by the suprascapular nerve.

A radiologic evaluation shows a fracture of the surgical neck of the right humerus. Which of the following muscles is supplied by the nerve that is most likely damaged?
Option: {'A': 'Infraspinatus', 'B': 'Teres minor', 'C': 'Supraspinatus', 'D': 'Teres major', 'E': 'Subscapularis'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is A. Infraspinatus.

The loss of sensation over the upper lateral aspect of the arm and shoulder, inability to raise the arm, and a fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus all suggest that the axillary nerve has been damaged. The axillary nerve originates from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus, carrying fibers from the C5 and C6 spinal roots, and supplies the deltoid and teres minor muscles as well as the skin over the lower two-thirds of the deltoid (the regimental badge area).

However, the teres minor (option B) and the deltoid are not the only muscles supplied by the axillary nerve. The Infraspinatus muscle (option A) is also supplied by the axillary nerve. The Infraspinatus muscle is a rotator cuff muscle, and it is involved in external rotation and abduction of the shoulder, movements that would be impaired in the scenario described.

Option C (Supraspinatus): This muscle is innervated by the suprascapular nerve, not the axillary nerve.

Option D (Teres major): This muscle is innervated by the lower subscapular nerve, not the axillary nerve.

Option E (Subscapularis): This muscle is innervated by the upper and lower subscapular nerves, not the axillary nerve."
886,"The best next step in management for this patient is D: Gastrografin swallow. The patient's presenting symptoms of dysphagia and regurgitation, as well as the subsequent development of chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpable crepitus above the clavicles suggest that he may have experienced a perforation of the esophagus. Esophageal perforation can occur during diagnostic procedures such as an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The palpable crepitus is due to subcutaneous emphysema, which can occur if air escapes from the esophagus and dissects into the soft tissues of the neck.

Gastrografin, a water-soluble contrast agent, is typically used first in suspected cases of esophageal perforation as it has a lower risk of causing a severe inflammatory response if it leaks into the mediastinum compared to barium. Therefore, answer A: Barium swallow, while helpful in diagnosing esophageal abnormalities, is not the best choice in this situation. If the Gastrografin swallow shows no leakage, then a barium swallow can be used to further delineate any smaller leaks.

Option B: Urgent surgery may eventually be required depending on the extent of the perforation and the patient's response to treatment, but it is not the immediate next step. Initial management typically involves a diagnostic imaging study.

Option C: Magnetic resonance imaging, and Option E: Ultrasound, while useful imaging studies in other contexts, are not first-line for diagnosing esophageal perforation.","stop","therefore, answer a: barium swallow, while helpful in diagnosing esophageal abnormalities, is not the best choice in this situation.","A","D","USMLE question: A 25-year-old man presents to his gastroenterologist for trouble swallowing. The patient states that whenever he eats solids, he regurgitates them back up. Given this patient's suspected diagnosis, the gastroenterologist performs a diagnostic test. Several hours later, the patient presents to the emergency department with chest pain and shortness of breath. His temperature is 99.5Ã?Â°F (37.5Ã?Â°C), blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, pulse is 60/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. On physical exam, the patient demonstrates a normal cardiopulmonary exam. His physical exam demonstrates no tenderness of the neck, a normal oropharynx, palpable crepitus above the clavicles, and minor lymphadenopathy. Which of the following is the best next step in management?
Option: {'A': 'Barium swallow', 'B': 'Urgent surgery', 'C': 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'D': 'Gastrografin swallow', 'E': 'Ultrasound'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The patient's symptoms of difficulty swallowing solids and regurgitating them back up suggest a diagnosis of achalasia, a condition in which the lower esophageal sphincter fails to relax properly, leading to difficulty in swallowing, regurgitation of undigested food, and chest pain. The diagnostic test performed by the gastroenterologist might have been an esophagoscopy or endoscopy to confirm the diagnosis.

The presentation of chest pain and shortness of breath several hours after the procedure, along with the physical examination findings of palpable crepitus above the clavicles and minor lymphadenopathy, suggest a complication of the procedure: pneumomediastinum, or air in the mediastinum. This can occur due to a perforation of the esophagus during the procedure, allowing air to leak into the surrounding tissues and mediastinum. Pneumomediastinum can lead to more serious complications like tension pneumothorax if not addressed promptly.

In this case, the best next step in management is a barium swallow (Option A), which can help to visualize the site of the esophageal perforation. It is the best initial test to diagnose esophageal perforation.

Option B (Urgent surgery) may eventually be necessary, but before proceeding to surgery, the diagnosis needs to be confirmed and the site of the perforation identified. 

Option C (Magnetic resonance imaging) is not the first-line imaging study in this scenario due to its longer duration and less spatial resolution compared to a CT scan.

Option D (Gastrografin swallow) is not the preferred initial test for suspected esophageal perforation because Gastrografin is an irritant and can cause chemical mediastinitis if it leaks into the mediastinum.

Option E (Ultrasound) is not typically used to visualize the esophagus and would not be helpful in this case."
899,"The correct answer is 'A: Frameshift mutation'.

Explanation:

Beta-thalassemia, a condition that reduces the production of hemoglobin, is caused by mutations in the HBB gene. The different forms of beta-thalassemia are classified based on the severity of symptoms. In this case, the boy's symptoms are severe due to the production of a malformed protein with more amino acids than normal, indicating that additional, unnecessary amino acids are incorporated in the protein. This is most likely caused by a frameshift mutation, which occurs when the number of nucleotides inserted or deleted from a DNA sequence is not a multiple of three. This alters the reading frame of the genetic code and often results in the production of a significantly altered protein. 

Why other options are wrong:

B: A missense mutation results from a single nucleotide change that causes the replacement of one amino acid with another in the protein. This may alter the function of the protein, but it does not typically lead to an increased length of the protein.

C: A nonsense mutation occurs when a change in the DNA sequence prematurely signals the cell to stop building a protein. This results in a shortened protein that may function improperly or not at all. It wouldn't result in a longer protein.

D: Silent mutations are DNA mutations that do not result in a change to the amino acid sequence of a protein. They would not cause an elongated protein.

E: Splice site mutations can cause the protein to be shorter or longer, but they more commonly cause loss of a section of the protein due to incorrect splicing of introns and exons. It's less likely than a frameshift mutation to cause the observed findings.","stop","the correct answer is 'a: frameshift mutation'.","A","E","USMLE question: A 4-year-old boy with beta thalassemia requires regular blood transfusions a few times per month because of persistent anemia.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","Option A: 'Frameshift mutation' is the correct answer. A frameshift mutation would add or subtract one or more bases, thus altering the reading frame of the genetic sequence and potentially causing the production of an abnormally long protein, as seen in this patient.

Option B: 'Missense mutation' is incorrect. A missense mutation would substitute one amino acid for another in the protein sequence, but it would not extend the length of the protein; the number of amino acids would remain the same.

Option C: 'Nonsense mutation' is also incorrect. A nonsense mutation would cause an early stop codon, resulting in a protein that is shorter than normal, not longer.

Option D: 'Silent mutation' is incorrect. Silent mutations do not change the protein sequence at all. They result in the coding for the same amino acid, so the protein remains unchanged.

Option E: 'Splice site mutation' is incorrect. Splice site mutations can cause abnormally long proteins, but they do this by causing introns to be retained or exons to be skipped in the processed mRNA. In beta-thalassemia, the mutations typically involve the beta-globin gene itself, not the splice sites that process its mRNA."
901,"The correct answer is A: Diabetes mellitus.

This man with exertional angina and significant left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis has multiple risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Diabetes mellitus is the most potent risk factor among those listed. Diabetes is considered a coronary heart disease equivalent, which means that a patient with diabetes who has not had a myocardial infarction (MI) has the same risk for MI as someone without diabetes who has had an MI. The other major risk factors for ASCVD, in descending order of potency, are as follows: LDL cholesterol >190 mg/dL, age (men â?¥45, women â?¥55), smoking, hypertension, and obesity (option D).

Although a positive family history (option C) of premature ASCVD (<55 for men, <65 for women) is a risk enhancer, it is not as potent a risk factor as diabetes or the other major risk factors. Hypertension (option B) and smoking (option E) are also significant risk factors for ASCVD, but they are not as potent as diabetes.

Option: {'A': 'Diabetes mellitus', 'B': 'Hypertension', 'C': 'Family history', 'D': 'Obesity', 'E': 'Smoking'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","Answer: E. Smoking

All of the options listed are known risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD). However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the patient's most significant risk factor is smoking. 

Smoking is considered the most modifiable risk factor for CAD and has a more immediate impact on the cardiovascular system compared to the other risk factors listed. It leads to endothelial damage and dysfunction, increased clotting tendency, enhanced lipid peroxidation, and reduced oxygen supply, all of which contribute to the development and progression of atherosclerosis.

Diabetes mellitus (option A) is a significant risk factor for CAD, as it leads to damage of the blood vessels due to high blood glucose levels. However, considering the patient's poor compliance with medications, it's likely that his diabetes is not optimally controlled, further increasing his risk for CAD.

Hypertension (option B) is another important risk factor for CAD as it accelerates atherosclerosis by damaging the endothelial lining of arteries, leading to plaque formation. But the scenario mentions that the patient is on treatment for hypertension, thus reducing his risk compared to other uncontrolled factors.

Family history of premature CAD (option C) is indeed a significant risk factor. However, it is a non-modifiable risk factor, unlike smoking, which is a modifiable risk factor.

Obesity (option D) contributes to CAD by promoting diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. However, the patient's BMI of 28.5 kg/m2 falls under the category of overweight, not obesity, thereby making it a lesser risk factor compared to smoking in this particular case.

Therefore, considering the patient's smoking habits along with his overall clinical scenario, it can be concluded that smoking is the most significant risk factor in this patient."
908,"This patient's back pain that worsens with extension (standing, going downstairs) and improves with flexion (sitting) suggests lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). LSS is a chronic degenerative condition resulting from facet joint hypertrophy, ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, and intervertebral disc protrusion, which all lead to narrowing of the spinal canal. This narrowing can compress the spinal cord or nerve roots, causing symptoms. Typical presentation includes back pain and neurogenic claudication (eg, pain in the buttock, thigh, or lower leg that is induced by walking or prolonged standing and relieved by rest, forward bending, or sitting). In addition to the classic history, straight leg raise and femoral stretch tests can be helpful in the diagnosis. Imaging studies are not required in typical presentations but are used when the diagnosis is unclear or before invasive procedures. Noninvasive treatments are tried first and include physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and epidural steroid injections.

It is caused by osteoarthritis of the spinal vertebra leading to bony overgrowth (osteophytes) and ligamentous thickening, which narrows the spinal canal and compresses the spinal nerves. Symptoms are often positional and classically improve with lumbar flexion (eg, sitting, bending forward) because it widens the spinal canal and decreases pressure on the nerves. Pain with walking, known as neurogenic claudication, can also occur and is often relieved by rest. First-line treatment is conservative, including physical therapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, naproxen), which can alleviate local inflammation and pain (Choice C). If conservative treatment fails, epidural glucocorticoid injections or surgical decompression may be considered.

An ankle-brachial index (Choice A) would be used if peripheral arterial disease was suspected. This patient does not have symptoms of claudication (ie, muscle pain with exertion, relieved by rest), and his physical examination (eg, strong pulses) is not suggestive of peripheral arterial disease.

MRI of the lumbosacral spine (Choice B) is an option if symptoms do not improve with conservative therapy or if there are signs of a neurologic deficit on examination (eg, weakness, incontinence).

Radiography of the lumbosacral spine (Choice D) is not the best choice because it does not visualize the neural structures and would not definitively identify the cause of this patient's symptoms.

Surgical spinal decompression (Choice E) would be considered if conservative treatments were ineffective or if severe or progressive neurologic deficits were present."
912,"The most likely diagnosis is B: Cocaine intoxication.

This patient's irritability, aggressive behavior, diaphoresis, dilated pupils, tachycardia, and elevated blood pressure are suggestive of sympathomimetic toxicity. Among the answer choices, the substances with significant sympathomimetic activity are cocaine and lisdexamfetamine. Although both can cause the symptoms observed in this patient, cocaine is more likely to cause severe and rapid onset of symptoms as in this case. Cocaine increases the levels of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin in the brain by blocking their reuptake, which leads to the psychomotor agitation, mydriasis, and cardiovascular effects seen in this patient. The onset of action is within minutes and the effects last for 1-2 hours if used intranasally or smoked. 

Option A: Caffeine intoxication can cause restlessness, nervousness, excitement, and insomnia, but it is not associated with severe aggressive behavior and does not cause significant tachycardia and hypertension.

Option C: Lisdexamfetamine is a prodrug of dextroamphetamine used for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and binge eating disorder. It can cause sympathomimetic effects but the onset of action and peak effects are slower (hours) compared to cocaine.

Option D: Phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication can cause aggressive behavior and mydriasis but is also associated with nystagmus, ataxia, and delirium or psychosis, which are not seen in this patient.

Option E: Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric condition characterized by hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking/speech. Acute onset of symptoms as seen in this patient is not typical. Also, vital signs are typically normal in schizophrenia unless the patient is extremely agitated.","stop","the most likely diagnosis is b: cocaine intoxication.","B","C","USMLE question: A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his roommates for aggressive and unusual behavior.

The patient's symptoms such as irritability, aggression, paranoia, tachycardia, increased blood pressure, dilated pupils, diaphoresis, and psychomotor agitation are all characteristic of stimulant intoxication. Cocaine is a stimulant and therefore, his symptoms are consistent with cocaine intoxication. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect: 

A. Caffeine intoxication can cause restlessness, nervousness, excitement, insomnia, flushed face, diuresis, and gastrointestinal disturbance. However, it does not typically cause aggression, paranoia, or the degree of hyperactivity seen in this patient.

C. Lisdexamfetamine is a prodrug of dextroamphetamine used to treat ADHD and binge eating disorder. Overdose can cause similar symptoms to that of cocaine intoxication, but since it is a prescription medicine, it is less likely to be the cause in a patient with no known history of ADHD or eating disorder.

D. Phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication can cause aggression and psychosis, as well as nystagmus and ataxia. However, PCP generally causes hypoactivity, not hyperactivity.

E. Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder that involves a break in reality and often results in some combination of hallucinations, delusions, and extremely disordered thinking and behavior. The acute onset of the patient's symptoms and their resolution over hours is not consistent with schizophrenia, which typically requires persistent symptoms for at least six months."
921,"The most likely diagnosis for this patient is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Choice A). This condition is often found in long-term smokers and presents with symptoms of shortness of breath and cough. COPD is characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (Choice B) is a chronic, progressive lung disease characterized by fibrosis of the pulmonary interstitium, leading to thickening of the alveolar walls and loss of lung capacity. However, it is usually associated with a restrictive pattern on pulmonary function tests, not an obstructive pattern as seen in this patient.

An endotracheal neoplasm (Choice C) could potentially cause symptoms of cough and shortness of breath, but this patient's long history of smoking and the findings on her pulmonary function tests make COPD a more likely diagnosis.

Chronic asthma (Choice D) is a condition that causes inflammation and narrowing of the bronchial tubes, which allows air to enter and leave the lungs. However, unlike COPD, asthma is usually reversible with treatment and doesn't show a progressive course.

Unilateral mainstem obstruction (Choice E) would typically cause unilateral decreased breath sounds, not bilateral as expected in this patient. Furthermore, the pulmonary function tests would likely show a mixed restrictive and obstructive pattern.

This is further supported by the finding of a flow-volume loop showing both inspiratory and expiratory flow limitation, which is consistent with a fixed airway obstruction as seen in centrally located lung tumors. 

COPD (option A) and chronic asthma (option D) primarily involve the smaller airways and typically show an obstructive pattern on pulmonary function test (PFT) with decreased expiratory flows, not inspiratory. 

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (option B) and other interstitial lung diseases are characterized by restrictive lung disease on PFT with reduced lung volumes and normal to increased flows. 

Unilateral mainstem obstruction (option E) would typically present with unilateral decreased breath sounds and unilateral wheezing, which is not mentioned in this patient's physical examination.

930,"This patient's presentation of recent abdominal pain, a decrease in size of her abdomen, and an ultrasound revealing a dead fetus is suggestive of a concealed abruption. In this condition, the placenta prematurely separates from the uterus, but the blood is confined to the uterine cavity and does not leak out of the vagina, so vaginal bleeding is not seen. The dead fetus and concealed blood can lead to consumptive coagulopathy (disseminated intravascular coagulation [DIC]) due to the release of tissue factor from the placental and fetal tissue, which initiates the extrinsic coagulation cascade. This patient's prolonged PT and aPTT, low platelets, and low fibrinogen levels (implied by the prolonged PT and aPTT) are suggestive of DIC. Moreover, the retroplacental clot can cause uterine distension leading to abdominal pain. 

The best immediate management is to stabilize the patient with intravenous (IV) fluids (Choice A) and arrange for an urgent delivery, usually by cesarean section. The delivery will remove the source of the tissue factor, which is driving the DIC. 

Initiating labor (Choice B) is not the most immediate step, since delivery will only be possible after the patient's condition is stabilized.

Abruptio placentae is the premature separation of the placenta from the uterus before delivery. It can lead to fetal death and maternal hemorrhage. It can also lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is reflected in this patient's laboratory results by a low platelet count and prolonged PT and PTT. 

Option 'A' (IV fluids) would be appropriate for this patient to help treat her likely hypovolemic shock from blood loss. However, her ongoing bleeding requires more urgent intervention. 

Option 'B' (initiation of labor) is incorrect because labor will not address her bleeding and coagulation abnormalities.

Option 'C' (D-dimer assay) is incorrect because a D-dimer is not required in this setting. It would be used to evaluate for a potential clot, such as in the setting of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, but it does not help in the diagnosis or management of abruptio placentae.

Option 'D' (fresh frozen plasma) - This is the correct answer. Fresh frozen plasma contains all the coagulation factors and is given to correct the coagulation abnormalities in DIC. Urgent correction of coagulopathy is needed in this patient to prevent further bleeding.

Option 'E' (low-molecular-weight heparin) is incorrect because this patient has a bleeding disorder, not a clotting disorder. Administration of heparin would further exacerbate her bleeding."
932,"The correct answer is A: Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP).

The presence of atypical glandular cells on a pap smear is a significant finding and requires further investigation due to the high risk of underlying malignancy or high-grade dysplasia. This patient's biopsy result has confirmed the presence of dysplastic changes in the cervical epithelial cells, which indicates a precancerous condition that requires treatment. 

Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is a common treatment option for such cases. LEEP is an outpatient procedure that uses a thin, low-voltage electrified wire loop to cut out abnormal tissue. It allows for removal of the affected tissue and also provides a specimen for histopathologic examination.

Option B: Cold knife conization is also a procedure to remove abnormal cervical tissue, but it is more invasive than LEEP and is typically reserved for cases where LEEP is contraindicated or for diagnostic purposes when glandular cell abnormalities are suspected.

This woman's most recent Pap test showed atypical glandular cells, which is concerning for a precancerous lesion in the endocervical canal (adenocarcinoma in situ or glandular cell cervical cancer) or endometrial pathology. In contrast to squamous cell abnormalities, glandular cell abnormalities, regardless of severity, are at risk of being a more invasive lesion. Therefore, they warrant further evaluation with endocervical sampling.

Endocervical sampling can be performed with endocervical curettage or with a more definitive excisional procedure such as a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) or cold-knife cone biopsy. LEEP is an outpatient procedure that uses a thin, low-voltage electrified wire loop to cut out the abnormal tissue. It has the advantage of obtaining a larger, more representative sample than endocervical curettage and allows for treatment if high-grade dysplasia is present.

Option B, Cold knife conization, could be considered, but it is more invasive and has a higher risk of complications than LEEP, so it is typically reserved for women with more severe disease or invasive cancer.

Options C and D, Follow-up pap smear in one year or 3 years, would be inappropriate because this patient's abnormal test results and biopsy findings indicate the potential for significant disease that should not be left to progress without intervention.

Option E, Repeat colposcopy in 6 months, would also be incorrect because the biopsy shows dysplastic changes indicating a need for a more definitive intervention, not just monitoring."
973,"This patient's symptoms of sadness, low energy, poor concentration, decreased sleep and appetite, and feelings of worthlessness are indicative of a major depressive episode.

The patient in this case presents with a high pulse rate and low blood pressure, which are clear signs of shock. The most likely cause in this context is hypovolemic shock secondary to trauma. One of the compensatory mechanisms that the body employs in response to acute blood loss is hemoconcentration, which is reflected by increased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. This is because while the volume of red blood cells decreases with bleeding, the plasma volume can decrease even more due to shifts in fluid from the intravascular space to the extravascular space, thus increasing the proportion of red blood cells to plasma in the intravascular space. This phenomenon is usually observed several hours after the initial injury and can be masked by IV fluid resuscitation, which replenishes the intravascular volume. However, hemoconcentration can be observed earlier in severe trauma cases, such as the one described in this question. 

The other options are incorrect because they either reflect normal or decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, which are not consistent with the patient's presentation. Normal hemoglobin and hematocrit levels (Option B: Hemoglobin: 15 g/dL, Hematocrit: 45%, MCV: 90 Âµm^3) would not be expected in a patient with severe trauma and active bleeding. Options C, D, and E represent different degrees of anemia, which would not be expected in the acute setting of a trauma patient.

In the process of protein synthesis by ribosomes, there are three key sites: A (Aminoacyl), P (Peptidyl), and E (Exit). The A site is the point of entry for the aminoacyl-tRNA (except for the first aminoacyl-tRNA, which enters the P site). This is the site where the antibiotic, mimicking the structure of aminoacyl-tRNA, would bind.

The P site is where the growing polypeptide chain is held. The antibiotic doesn't bind here but is transferred here by peptidyl transferase.

The E site is the exit site for the now uncharged tRNA after it has donated its amino acid to the growing peptide chain.

The '30S small subunit' and '40S small subunit' are parts of the ribosome in bacteria and eukaryotes, respectively. While they are involved in protein synthesis, they are not the specific sites where the action of the antibiotic as described would occur.

This condition, previously referred to as postpartum depression, can occur during pregnancy or in the weeks to months following delivery. It is important to distinguish depression with peripartum-onset from the ""baby blues,"" which is a self-limited period of emotional lability, tearfulness, and irritability occurring in the first 2 weeks postpartum. Depression with peripartum-onset can have serious consequences, including maternal suicide and infanticide, and should be treated aggressively.

In patients with poor prognostic features (eg, high disease activity, seropositivity, early joint damage, failure of two non-biologic DMARDs), biologic agents, such as adalimumab, may be considered.

This question relates to the principles of fluid dynamics, specifically the concept of Poiseuille's law, which states that flow across a tube (or in this case, an artery) is proportional to the fourth power of the radius. This means that if the radius of the artery is halved (as in 50% stenosis), the flow is decreased by a factor of 2^4 = 16.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","Answer: B '4'

Explanation: The flow of blood through a vessel, based on the principles of fluid dynamics, is related to the fourth power of the radius of the artery, according to Poiseuille's law. Decreasing the radius by a factor of two (which is what 50% stenosis does) would decrease the flow by a factor of 2^4, or 16. However, the question asks by what factor the flow has been decreased compared to a normal artery, not the absolute flow rate, so the answer is 4 times, not 16 times. This is because the stenotic artery has 1/4 of the flow of a normal artery, or in other words, the flow has been decreased by a factor of 4.

Options A, C, D, and E are all different powers of 2 and do not accurately represent the decrease in flow resulting from a 50% stenosis based on Poiseuille's law."

The patient's ECG findings and symptoms are most consistent with atrial fibrillation (AF), a common arrhythmia in the elderly and in patients with hypertension and heart failure. AF is characterized by an irregularly irregular rhythm and absence of P waves on ECG. Because of the risk of thromboembolism (e.g., stroke) in AF, patients require anticoagulation.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban are increasingly used instead of warfarin for this indication because they do not require monitoring of the international normalized ratio. Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor and can be reversed with idarucizumab. Rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban are factor Xa inhibitors and can be reversed with andexanet alfa.

This patient's symptoms (palpitations and shortness of breath), irregularly irregular rhythm on cardiac examination, and absence of P waves on ECG are suggestive of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a common type of supraventricular tachycardia characterized by disorganized atrial electrical activity and inadequate atrial emptying. This can lead to blood stasis and thrombus formation within the atria, most commonly in the left atrial appendage. If the thrombus embolizes, it can result in a stroke or systemic embolism. Therefore, anticoagulation is recommended in patients with atrial fibrillation and additional risk factors for stroke (e.g., age >65, hypertension, heart failure as in this patient).

Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor, whereas apixaban and rivaroxaban are direct factor Xa inhibitors. Both classes of drugs can be used for anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation. However, dabigatran can be reversed with idarucizumab whereas there is no specific reversal agent for the factor Xa inhibitors. Therefore, the correct answer is direct inhibition of factor Xa.

Option A is wrong because induction of conformational change in antithrombin III is the mechanism of action for heparin, not for direct factor Xa inhibitors. Option B is incorrect as inhibition of thrombocyte phosphodiesterase III is the mechanism of action for drugs like cilostazol and dipyridamole, not direct factor Xa inhibitors. Option C is wrong because irreversible inhibition of GPIIb/IIIa complex is the mechanism of action for abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban, not direct factor Xa inhibitors. Option E is wrong because direct inhibition of thrombin is the mechanism of action for dabigatran, not direct factor Xa inhibitors like apixaban and rivaroxaban."

1114,"The correct answer is D. 'Decreased hepatic de novo cholesterol synthesis'.

Atorvastatin belongs to the statin class of medications, and it works by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which is the rate-limiting step in hepatic cholesterol synthesis. By decreasing the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver, statins increase the expression of LDL receptors on the hepatocyte surface, leading to increased clearance of LDL from the circulation. 

Cholestyramine is a bile acid sequestrant. It binds bile acids in the intestine, preventing their reabsorption and increasing their fecal excretion. This leads to a depletion of the hepatic pool of cholesterol, as bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver. To compensate for this loss, the liver increases the synthesis of new bile acids from cholesterol, leading to upregulation of LDL receptors and increased clearance of LDL from the circulation. 

So, while both drugs lead to increased LDL receptor expression (option B), this is not a direct effect of the drugs, but rather a compensatory response of the liver to their actions. The direct effect of both drugs is to decrease hepatic cholesterol, either by inhibiting its synthesis (atorvastatin) or by increasing its consumption for bile acid synthesis (cholestyramine). 

Option A, 'Increased lipoprotein lipase activity', is incorrect because neither atorvastatin nor cholestyramine directly affect lipoprotein lipase activity. 

Option C, 'Increased hepatic bile salt synthesis', is incorrect because while cholestyramine indirectly leads to increased bile salt synthesis by depleting the hepatic pool of cholesterol, atorvastatin does not have this effect.

Atorvastatin is a statin medication, which works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in hepatic cholesterol synthesis. This effectively decreases the amount of cholesterol produced in the liver.

Cholestyramine is a bile acid sequestrant, which binds to bile acids in the gut to prevent their reabsorption. Since bile acids are primarily composed of cholesterol, this forces the liver to use more of its cholesterol stores to produce new bile acids, effectively reducing the amount of cholesterol in the body. This doesn't directly decrease hepatic de novo cholesterol synthesis, but it indirectly does so by reducing the amount of cholesterol available in the liver for reabsorption.

Option A is incorrect because neither atorvastatin nor cholestyramine directly affects lipoprotein lipase activity. 

Option B is incorrect because only statins (such as atorvastatin) increase LDL receptor expression. Cholestyramine does not have this effect.

This patient's organ transplant history, fever, cough, hepatosplenomegaly, and ulcerative oral lesions suggest a systemic fungal infection. The presence of broad-based budding yeasts on biopsy is characteristic of Blastomyces dermatitidis. Blastomycosis is common in the Mississippi and Ohio River basins and can cause a flu-like illness, pulmonary disease, and cutaneous or bony disease. It is contracted through inhalation, and in immunocompromised patients, can disseminate to the skin, bone, and other organs. The oral lesions are typically verrucous and ulcerative.

Option A: 'Aspergillus fumigatus' typically causes invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients, but it would not cause the oral lesions seen in this patient. Microscopically, it has septate hyphae that branch at acute angles.

Option C: 'Histoplasma capsulatum' can cause similar symptoms to Blastomyces but the yeast cells are smaller and do not exhibit broad-based budding. Instead, they are typically found within macrophages.

Option D: 'Paracoccidioides brasiliensis' also causes similar symptoms but it's endemic to Latin America. Microscopically, it has a ""pilot's wheel"" appearance due to multiple budding yeast cells.

Option E: 'Coccidioides immitis' is endemic to the southwestern United States and parts of Central and South America. It can cause similar symptoms, but the spherules filled with endospores seen microscopically are not evident in this case."
1128,"This patient's polyarticular arthritis and genitourinary symptoms are suggestive of disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI). DGI usually occurs within several days to weeks after the initial sexually transmitted infection. It typically presents with a migratory polyarthropathy that may be associated with tenosynovitis and dermatitis (eg, pustules, vesicles, petechiae, macules). The affected joints are often asymmetric and tender on examination.

The best next step in management is to perform arthrocentesis to confirm the diagnosis (Choice A). Arthrocentesis should be performed in patients with an acute monoarticular arthritis to evaluate for septic arthritis, gout, and pseudogout. In this case, gram stain of the joint fluid would likely show gram-negative diplococci, confirming gonococcal septic arthritis.

Option B (Azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin) would be correct if septic arthritis were confirmed by arthrocentesis. However, without joint fluid analysis, other causes of arthritis cannot be ruled out.

Option C (Ibuprofen and observation) would be inadequate treatment for suspected septic arthritis, which can cause rapid joint destruction if not promptly treated.

Option D (Methotrexate) would be inappropriate as it is primarily used for chronic management of rheumatoid arthritis, not acute monoarticular joint pain.

Option E (MRI) would not be appropriate as the first step because arthrocentesis can provide both diagnostic information and therapeutic relief.

DGI results from gonococcal bacteremia and is characterized by tenosynovitis, dermatitis, and polyarthralgia/arthritis. Tenosynovitis most commonly affects the wrists, hands, ankles, and feet. Dermatitis manifests as painless pustules on an erythematous base. Polyarthralgia/arthritis, typically asymmetric, can affect any joint but most commonly affects the knees and wrists. Gonococcemia can be intermittent, and fever as well as skin lesions may not be present at the time of examination. It is most common in women and men who have sex with men, but it can occur in heterosexual men (as in this patient).

A: Non-bilious vomiting can occur in a variety of gastrointestinal disorders such as gastroenteritis, food poisoning, and bowel obstruction, not specifically a duodenal ulcer. 

B: Early satiety is often associated with gastroparesis or blockages in the stomach, such as from a gastric cancer or ulcer, rather than a duodenal ulcer.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) does not recommend routine prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing for prostate cancer due to the potential harm outweighing the benefits. The risks include false-positive results leading to unnecessary biopsies, over-diagnosis, and over-treatment, which can cause harms such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence. The American Urological Association suggests shared decision-making for men aged 55-69 years who are considering PSA testing. It also recommends against routine screening in average-risk men <55 years and >70 years.

Option B, Digital rectal examination, is not recommended for routine screening for prostate cancer due to the lack of evidence of its benefits.

Option C, Serum PSA level, as discussed above, is not recommended for routine screening due to potential harms.

Option D, Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), is not used for routine screening. It is typically used in conjunction with a biopsy to diagnose prostate cancer in men with an abnormal PSA or digital rectal examination.

Option E, Contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis, is not used for screening but may be used for staging in men with diagnosed prostate cancer. It is not a recommended method for screening due to its lack of sensitivity and specificity, as well as its associated radiation exposure. 

In this patient's case, he does not have a strong family history of prostate cancer (only one relative, an uncle, had the disease), and he is not African American (who are at higher risk).

The potential harms of screening and treatment include false-positive results that require additional testing and possible prostate biopsy; overdiagnosis and overtreatment; and treatment complications, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction. 

For men aged 55 to 69 years, the decision to undergo periodic PSA-based screening should be an individual one and should include discussion of the potential benefits and harms of screening with their clinician.

1189,"The correct answer is D. 'Decreased functioning of the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR)'. 

This patient with chronic renal failure is presenting with secondary hyperparathyroidism, a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In CKD, decreased renal phosphate excretion and impaired hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D contribute to hypocalcemia. The calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) in the parathyroid glands detects this decrease in serum calcium and stimulates parathyroid hormone (PTH) release to restore calcium levels. This is similar to the mechanism in familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, a condition that results from loss-of-function mutations of the CASR gene that decrease the sensitivity of the parathyroid gland to calcium. 

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. End-stage liver failure can cause metabolic bone disease, but it does not typically cause hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

B. Insufficient calcium intake can lead to hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism, but it is not the best answer because it doesn't involve a similar pathophysiologic mechanism as the question stem.

C. Parathyroid adenoma causes primary hyperparathyroidism, a condition characterized by hypercalcemia, not hypocalcemia.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is D. 'Decreased functioning of the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR)'. 

The calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) on the parathyroid gland plays a crucial role in maintaining serum calcium homeostasis. It senses the level of ionized calcium in the blood and regulates the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). In conditions where serum calcium is low, such as in chronic renal failure, the CASR is less activated leading to increased secretion of PTH. This is a compensatory mechanism trying to increase serum calcium levels by enhancing bone resorption and renal reabsorption of calcium.

Option A: End-stage liver failure is not associated with hyperparathyroidism. Liver disease can cause abnormalities in calcium and bone metabolism, but it mainly does this through vitamin D deficiency and not through PTH.

Option B: Insufficient calcium intake can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism as the body tries to increase serum calcium levels. However, this is a dietary issue and not a receptor or signaling issue like in the case of the patient.

Option C: In parathyroid adenoma, there is a primary increase in PTH due to the autonomous production of PTH by the adenoma, irrespective of serum calcium levels. This is different from the patient's case where the increase in PTH is a response to low serum calcium levels, not a primary problem in the parathyroid gland.

Option E: Sarcoidosis, a systemic granulomatous disease, can cause hypercalcemia due to increased production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by the granulomas. It is not associated with increased PTH levels. In fact, PTH levels may be suppressed in sarcoidosis due to the hypercalcemia."

The bacteria produce toxins that cause colonic mucosal injury, leading to a spectrum of manifestations, from asymptomatic colonization to mild diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, and death.
First-line treatment for an initial episode of nonsevere CDI (ie, leukocytosis with a WBC <15,000/mm3 and serum creatinine <1.5 times the baseline) is oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's presentation of severe watery diarrhea, fever, and recent antibiotic usage suggests a diagnosis of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). CDI is typically associated with antibiotic usage, especially broad-spectrum antibiotics such as amoxicillin, which disrupt the normal colonic flora and allow for overgrowth of C difficile. The bacteria produce toxins that cause mucosal inflammation, resulting in symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. Severe disease can lead to fulminant colitis, characterized by severe abdominal pain, distension, and systemic toxicity. Pregnant women are at an increased risk for CDI due to immunologic changes and increased healthcare contacts, including hospitalizations and antibiotic usage. 

Initial management of CDI depends on disease severity. In patients with severe CDI (eg, WBC =15,000/mm3, acute kidney injury), oral vancomycin is preferred over metronidazole. For patients with fulminant (ie, critically ill) CDI, combination oral vancomycin and IV metronidazole is recommended. Vancomycin should be given orally because IV vancomycin does not reach the colon. However, IV metronidazole is added because it can reach the colon when the inflammation is severe, leading to increased colonic permeability.

Skin findings in dermatitis herpetiformis typically include pruritic, papulovesicular eruptions on extensor surfaces (eg, elbows). Dermatitis herpetiformis is thought to be caused by an autoimmune response to gluten ingestion (specifically, gliadin), so the correct answer is B, hypersensitivity to gliadin.

1222,"The correct answer is 'C': '48 hours and 11mm diameter'.

The purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin skin test (TST) is read by measuring the diameter of induration (palpable, raised, hardened area) across the forearm (perpendicular to the long axis) in millimeters. The test should be read between 48 to 72 hours after the administration. Patients who do not return within 72 hours will need to be rescheduled for another skin test.

The size of the induration needed to define a positive result depends on the patient's risk of being infected with TB and the risk of progression to disease if infected. For a medical student with no risk factors (HIV negative, no drug use, no prior healthcare work, no sick contacts), an induration of 11 mm or more is considered a positive result.

Option A and B are incorrect as the test should not be read at 24 or 36 hours. Option D and E are incorrect as while 72 hours is an acceptable time to read the test, the induration diameter is too large for a low-risk individual.

The Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) test, also known as the Mantoux tuberculin skin test, is used to diagnose latent tuberculosis infection. In this test, tuberculin, a product derived from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is injected intradermally. If a person has been exposed to tuberculosis, their immune system will react to the tuberculin, causing an area of induration (hard swelling) to form at the injection site.

The test should be read 48 to 72 hours after it is placed. A positive reaction is determined by the size of the induration. The greater the induration, the more likely it is that the person has been infected with tuberculosis. However, the cut-off for a positive result varies depending on the person's risk factors for tuberculosis.

In this case, the patient is a medical student with no known risk factors. For people with no known risk factors for tuberculosis, an induration of 15mm or more is considered positive. However, in people who have certain risk factors, such as recent immigrants from high-prevalence countries, IV drug users, residents and employees of high-risk congregate settings, mycobacteriology lab personnel, persons with clinical conditions that place them at high risk, and children less than 4 years of age, or infants, children, and adolescents exposed to adults in high-risk categories, an induration of 10mm or more is considered positive.

1247,"The answer is 'A': Even-chain fatty acids.

This child's presentation of poor feeding, vomiting, and hypotonia in the neonatal period is suggestive of an organic acidemia. These are a group of autosomal recessive metabolic disorders characterized by the accumulation of abnormal amounts of organic acids in body tissues and fluids, especially the urine. Many organic acidemias are due to defects in the metabolism of amino acids, but some, like propionic acidemia, are due to defects in the metabolism of fatty acids. Propionic acidemia is caused by a deficiency in propionyl-CoA carboxylase, which is involved in the catabolic pathways of the amino acids valine, isoleucine, threonine, and methionine, as well as odd-chain fatty acids. However, even-chain fatty acids also contribute to propionic acid production as they can be metabolized to propionyl-CoA, which then accumulates due to the enzyme deficiency.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

B: Hexose monosaccharides - Defects in carbohydrate metabolism typically lead to accumulation of glucose or its metabolites.

C: Branched-chain amino acids - Disorders of branched-chain amino acid metabolism, such as maple syrup urine disease, result in accumulation of their respective ketoacids (not propionic acid).

D: Catechol-containing monoamines - These are metabolized to vanillylmandelic acid, homovanillic acid, and metanephrines, not propionic acid.

Isoniazid is associated with hepatotoxicity and a dose-dependent peripheral neuropathy that is more common in malnourished individuals and those with HIV, renal failure, diabetes mellitus, and alcoholism. The neuropathy is due to interference with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) metabolism. Pyridoxine is a required cofactor for many enzymatic reactions, including those necessary for the synthesis of neurotransmitters such as GABA within the CNS. Pyridoxine deficiency impairs these reactions and results in the accumulation of neurotoxic intermediates.

Instead, these findings, coupled with the family history of ""liver disease,"" suggest hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). HH is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by increased intestinal iron absorption. Over time, iron deposition in tissues leads to end-organ damage, including liver disease (eg, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma), skin hyperpigmentation, diabetes mellitus, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Testing for HH should be performed by measurement of serum transferrin saturation (Option D). Transferrin saturation is calculated as {serum iron Ã· TIBC} Ã? 100%. A transferrin saturation >45% is suggestive of HH and should prompt genetic testing for the C282Y/C282Y mutation.

HH can cause anemia through several mechanisms. First, iron overload can be directly toxic to erythroid precursors. Second, iron overload can lead to the development of splenomegaly and subsequent hypersplenism (increased consumption of cells in the spleen). However, this patient does not have splenomegaly, making these less likely.

When a patient's autonomy (ie, right to make decisions about their own health care) and the family's wishes conflict, the health care team should seek guidance from the ethics committee.

Options:
'A': Obtain court order to revoke written advance directive - This is not an immediate option and is unlikely to be granted because courts typically uphold the autonomy of patients to make their own health care decisions.
'B': Supportive care only - This would be the appropriate course of action if the patient specifically indicated in the advance directive that he didn't want any treatments. However, the specific treatments should be discussed with the patient or his healthcare proxy.
'C': Reperform resuscitation when needed - This goes against the DNR order and thus is not an appropriate choice.
'D': Contact the patient's oldest child - There's no indication that the patient's oldest child is a designated healthcare proxy. The wife, as the power of attorney, is the appropriate person to involve in the decision-making process along with the ethics committee."
1277,"The patient's hypotension (blood pressure 84/58 mm Hg), tachycardia (pulse 115/min), and warm extremities suggest a distributive shock, which is characterized by vasodilation and maldistribution of blood flow. The most common causes of distributive shock are sepsis, anaphylaxis, and neurogenic shock. However, this patient with acute pancreatitis (ie, epigastric abdominal pain radiating to the back, nausea, leukocytosis, elevated amylase) has developed systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to leakage of pancreatic enzymes.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's presentation of severe, constant upper abdominal pain radiating to the back is characteristic of acute pancreatitis, which is confirmed by the elevated serum amylase. The most common causes of acute pancreatitis are gallstones and alcohol use. In this case, the patient's hypotension and tachycardia suggest hypovolemic shock due to third-spacing of fluids. In acute pancreatitis, pancreatic autodigestion leads to release of inflammatory mediators, causing increased vascular permeability and leakage of protein-rich fluid into the peritoneal cavity and retroperitoneum. This results in intravascular volume depletion (ie, hypovolemia), decreased preload, and decreased cardiac output, leading to tachycardia and hypotension (Option C).

Option A (Hemorrhagic fluid loss) is incorrect. Hemorrhagic shock would be more likely in a patient with a history of trauma, aortic aneurysm, or anticoagulant use. This patient's normal hematocrit level argues against significant blood loss.

Option B (Decreased albumin concentration) is incorrect. Although serum albumin helps maintain intravascular oncotic pressure, this patient's presentation is not consistent with conditions associated with hypoalbuminemia (eg, nephrotic syndrome, liver disease).

Option D (Increased excretion of water) is incorrect. Increased water excretion would result in dehydration and a hypernatremic state, which isn't evident here.

1281,"The patient's symptoms and biopsy findings are suggestive of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). HL is a malignancy of B lymphocytes. Classic Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) is characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells, which are multinucleate giant lymphocytes with prominent nucleoli that resemble eosinophilic inclusions.

Biliary atresia is a rare disease of the liver and bile ducts that occurs in newborns.

In this case, the patient's increasing yellow discoloration (jaundice), extension of the jaundice to the palms and soles, palpable liver, and family history (older brother with a liver condition) all point towards this diagnosis. Additionally, the laboratory results show a high total bilirubin level with normal transaminases, which is consistent with a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia that would occur in biliary atresia.

Option B, Physiologic neonatal jaundice, is a common condition that occurs in the first week of life due to the newborn's immature liver. This condition would not extend to the palms and soles and typically resolves by two weeks of age.

1327,"The correct answer is A: '[30 / (30 + 70)] / [1 / (1 + 99)]'. 

The relative risk (RR) is a measure that compares the risk of a health event (a disease, injury, risk factor, or death) among one group with the risk among another group. In other words, it is the ratio of the probability of an event occurring in an exposed group to the probability of an event occurring in a comparison, non-exposed group. 

The formula for calculating RR is [A / (A + B)] / [C / (C + D)], where:

- A is the number of event occurrences in the exposed group
- B is the number of non-event occurrences in the exposed group
- C is the number of event occurrences in the non-exposed group
- D is the number of non-event occurrences in the non-exposed group

In this case:
- A is the number of exposed patients who contracted the disease, which is 30
- B is the number of exposed patients who did not contract the disease, which is 70
- C is the number of unexposed patients who contracted the disease, which is 1
- D is the number of unexposed patients who did not contract the disease, which is 99

Relative risk (RR) is a measure of the risk of a certain event happening in one group compared to the risk of the same event happening in another group. It is calculated by dividing the probability of the event occurring in the exposed group by the probability of the event occurring in the non-exposed (or less exposed) group.

In this case, the event is contracting bacterial meningitis. The exposed group is the one that was in contact with a patient with active disease, and the non-exposed group is the one that was not.

The probability of the event in the exposed group is the number of people who contracted the disease (30) divided by the total number of people in that group (100). Similarly, the probability of the event in the non-exposed group is the number of people who contracted the disease (1) divided by the total number of people in that group (100).

So, the relative risk (RR) is (30/100) / (1/100) = (30 * 100) / (1 * 100) = 30/1 = 30

1332,"The answer is A: Antidiuretic hormone.

This patient's failure to lactate, fatigue, hypotension (evidenced by lightheadedness), and inability to tolerate cold environments suggest Sheehan syndrome. Sheehan syndrome is pituitary infarction caused by severe postpartum hemorrhage. Necrosis of the pituitary gland can result in panhypopituitarism, a deficiency of all pituitary hormones. The anterior pituitary gland secretes prolactin, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and growth hormone (GH). So all these hormones will be deficient in this patient leading to symptoms such as failure to lactate (due to prolactin deficiency), hypothyroidism and weight gain (due to TSH deficiency), and fatigue and hypotension (due to ACTH leading to cortisol deficiency). Therefore, Aldosterone (option B), cortisol (option C), and luteinizing hormone (option D) levels would be expected to be low in this patient.

On the other hand, the posterior pituitary gland, which secretes antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and oxytocin, is usually spared in Sheehan syndrome, because it has a different blood supply compared to the anterior pituitary gland. So, antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels would be expected to be normal in this patient.

Sheehan syndrome, or postpartum pituitary necrosis, is caused by ischemic infarction of the pituitary gland. It often occurs following massive postpartum hemorrhage (as might occur secondary to placenta accreta, as in this patient) that leads to hypovolemic shock and pituitary necrosis. The anterior pituitary gland secretes a number of hormones including prolactin (necessary for lactation), growth hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH, which leads to cortisol release), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, which stimulates thyroid hormone release), luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Therefore, a deficiency in these hormones can lead to failure to lactate (prolactin deficiency), fatigue and postural hypotension (ACTH deficiency leading to cortisol deficiency), and cold intolerance and weight gain (TSH deficiency leading to thyroid hormone deficiency). The posterior pituitary secretes oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone (ADH); the latter is typically preserved in Sheehan syndrome because the posterior pituitary has a separate (and more robust) blood supply than the anterior pituitary. Therefore, the levels of ADH (option A) would most likely be normal in this patient.

Aldosterone (option B) is regulated primarily by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, not the pituitary, but ACTH does have a minor stimulatory role in its secretion.

1354,"The correct answer is 'E': Uterine fundal massage.

This woman's vaginal bleeding immediately following delivery and soft, enlarged uterus are suggestive of uterine atony, a common cause of postpartum hemorrhage. After delivery, the uterus should normally contract to its pre-pregnancy size, which helps to compress the blood vessels and stop bleeding. Uterine atony is a failure of the uterus to contract and can lead to significant blood loss.

Uterine fundal massage is the initial management for uterine atony. It stimulates the uterus to contract and is often effective in controlling bleeding. Other treatments for uterine atony, including oxytocin infusion, should be continued concurrently.

Other than mild asthma, the patientÃ¢â?¬â?¢s pregnancy has been uncomplicated. She has attended many prenatal appointments and followed the physician's advice about screening for diseases, laboratory testing, diet, and exercise. Previous pregnancies were uncomplicated. She has no history of a serious illness. She is currently on intravenous infusion of oxytocin. Her temperature is 37.2Ã?Â°C (99.0Ã?Â°F), blood pressure is 108/60 mm Hg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 17/min. Uterine palpation reveals a soft enlarged fundus that extends above the umbilicus. Based on the assessment of the birth canal and placenta, which of the following options is the most appropriate initial step in patient management?
Option: {'A': 'Discontinuing oxytocin', 'B': 'Intramuscular carboprost', 'C': 'Intravenous methylergonovine', 'D': 'Manual exploration of the uterus', 'E': 'Uterine fundal massage'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's postpartum bleeding and uterine atony (ie, soft, enlarged uterus) despite oxytocin administration suggest the diagnosis of uterine atony, the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage. Initial management should include simultaneous initiation of uterine massage and administration of uterotonic medications. The preferred first-line uterotonic agent is oxytocin because it causes strong, regular contractions with minimal side effects. However, this patient is already receiving oxytocin, and her uterus remains atonic, suggesting that she may be refractory to this treatment. Therefore, the next best step in management is the administration of a second-line uterotonic agent.

Carboprost (choice B) is a prostaglandin F2a analog that directly stimulates uterine contractions and is indicated when oxytocin and methylergonovine are ineffective or contraindicated. Carboprost is contraindicated in patients with asthma due to bronchoconstrictive effects and hence is not suitable for this patient.

Methylergonovine (choice C) is an ergot alkaloid that causes sustained uterine contractions and is often used when oxytocin fails to produce adequate uterine tone. It is not contraindicated in asthma and would be the appropriate medication in this situation.

Discontinuing oxytocin (choice A) would not be appropriate, as this could potentially worsen bleeding.

Manual exploration of the uterus (choice D) is typically reserved for when medical management fails or there is suspicion of retained products of conception causing the bleeding. The question stem notes no abnormalities on assessment of the placenta, making retained products less likely.

Finally, uterine fundal massage (choice E) is an important initial step in management but should be done concurrently with uterotonic administration. If the patient is unresponsive to oxytocin, additional medical therapy (eg, methylergonovine) is needed. 

So, the correct answer is 'C': Intravenous methylergonovine."
1386,"The answer is B: Along the lesser curve at the incisura angularis.

Gastric peptic ulcers most often occur along the lesser curve at the incisura angularis, an angular notch along the lesser curvature of the stomach. This is due to the high acid production in the stomach and the relatively lower protective factors in this region, making it more susceptible to ulcer formation.

Option A (In the pyloric channel within 3 cm of the pylorus) is incorrect because ulcers in this location are less common. 

Option C (Proximal gastroesophageal ulcer near the gastroesophageal junction) is incorrect because ulcers are less common in this location, and are more typically associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease, which this patient does not have any symptoms suggestive of. 

Option D (In the body) is incorrect as ulcers are less common in this area. Gastric acid production is highest in the body of the stomach, but it also has the highest concentration of protective factors, which help to prevent ulcers.

Option E (Multiple sites throughout the stomach) is incorrect as it is unusual for gastric ulcers to be located in multiple sites throughout the stomach.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is B: 'Along the lesser curve at the incisura angularis'. 

Explanation: Peptic ulcers are most commonly found in the stomach and the proximal duodenum. Gastric ulcers specifically tend to occur along the lesser curve at the incisura angularis. This is in part due to the aggressive effect of gastric acid and pepsin, coupled with a relative deficiency in the local defense mechanisms of the involved gastric mucosa.

Why the other options are wrong:

A: The pyloric channel within 3 cm of the pylorus is where you would more likely find duodenal ulcers, not gastric ulcers.

C: Proximal gastroesophageal ulcers near the gastroesophageal junction are typically seen in the setting of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) rather than peptic ulcer disease. 

D: Ulcers in the body of the stomach can occur, but are less common than those found along the lesser curve at the incisura angularis. 

E: While ulcers can occur at multiple sites throughout the stomach, this is less common and may be indicative of a condition such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, which involves gastrin-secreting tumors that lead to multiple ulcers. This patient's presentation is more indicative of a single peptic ulcer."
1392,"The correct answer is 'D': Physiologic conditions outside the heart.

This boy has a systolic ejection murmur, which is most commonly due to turbulence of blood flow across the semilunar valves. The most common cause in children is normal flow across normal valves, also referred to as an innocent murmur. They are typically of grade 1-3 intensity, are best heard at the left upper sternal border (second intercostal space) or between the apex and left lower sternal border, and do not radiate. They generally decrease in intensity with maneuvers that decrease venous return to the heart, like standing or sitting from supine position (valsalva maneuver).

Option A (Defect of the septum secundum) and Option B (Failure of the septum primum to fuse with the endocardial cushions) refer to atrial septal defects, which usually present with a fixed, widely split S2 and systolic ejection murmur at the upper left sternal border due to increased flow across the pulmonic valve.

A large-bore needle is inserted in the second intercostal space at the midclavicular line, which allows the trapped air to escape and the lung to reexpand.

Option A (Extracorporeal life support) is a form of cardiopulmonary bypass used to oxygenate blood outside the body. It's used in severe respiratory failure when conventional treatments (e.g., intubation, ventilation) have failed. It's not the first-line treatment for pneumothorax.

Hence, the most appropriate initial step in the management of this patient is Chest tube placement (option D).

A tension pneumothorax occurs when a damaged area of lung or chest wall allows air to enter the pleural space but not exit, causing pressure to build up with each breath. This pressure collapses the lung and can also push the mediastinum to the contralateral side, compromising venous return to the heart and leading to cardiovascular collapse. Signs of a tension pneumothorax include absent breath sounds and hyperresonance to percussion on the affected side, along with deviation of the trachea and mediastinum to the opposite side. The x-ray will show a completely or almost completely opacified hemithorax.

1402,"The patient's presentation of sudden onset severe chest pain, hypotension, and new murmur following myocardial infarction is suggestive of a mechanical complication. In this case, the echocardiogram finding of left ventricular wall motion abnormality with a large pericardial effusion suggests ventricular free wall rupture with resulting hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The patient described has developed hypotension and signs of cardiogenic shock (eg, altered mental status, pale, diaphoretic) following a myocardial infarction (MI). This would most often suggest acute mitral regurgitation due to papillary muscle rupture. However, in this case, the presence of a new pericardial effusion with significant wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram suggests the development of a ventricular free wall rupture (VFW) with resultant hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade. This is a mechanical complication that typically occurs 5-14 days following an MI. Patients usually present with severe chest pain and rapidly progress to profound shock, as the accumulating blood in the noncompliant pericardium prevents the heart from filling during diastole. The next step in this scenario would be an emergency pericardiocentesis (Option C), which can provide temporary stabilization by removing the effusion and relieving the tamponade.
Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (Option A) involves the insertion of a catheter with a balloon tip into the aorta. The balloon inflates during diastole, increasing coronary blood flow, and deflates during systole, reducing afterload. This can help in cardiogenic shock but would not be indicated in this case due to the presence of cardiac tamponade.
Administering dobutamine (Option B) can increase cardiac output by increasing myocardial contractility, but it would not help in this case due to the presence of cardiac tamponade.
Immediate transfer to the OR (Option D) would be a consideration following pericardiocentesis and initial stabilization of the patient. The patient will need surgical intervention to repair the VFW.

This patient's presentation of loss of consciousness after ingestion of a large amount of acetaminophen, in the setting of hepatic injury indicated by significantly elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values, is suggestive of acute acetaminophen toxicity. Acetaminophen is metabolized in the liver by glucuronidation and sulfation. When these pathways are saturated, it is metabolized by cytochrome P-450 to a toxic metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI is usually detoxified by glutathione to a non-toxic metabolite. However, in the setting of acetaminophen overdose, glutathione stores become depleted, and NAPQI accumulates, causing hepatic injury. 

Option A (Alcohol abuse) is incorrect because although chronic alcohol use can cause hepatocellular injury, the acute nature of this patient's presentation and the extremely high transaminase values are more consistent with an acute process like acetaminophen toxicity.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","Based on the information provided, the patient is likely to have hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis (Option A). Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is often treated with glucocorticoids, which may lead to iatrogenic Cushing syndrome from chronic use. Symptoms of iatrogenic Cushing syndrome include hypertension, thinning of the skin, easy bruising, and striae, which are seen in this patient. Chronic glucocorticoid therapy can also lead to hypokalemia due to increased mineralocorticoid activity. However, this patient is also on a medication to manage his GPA -- cyclophosphamide --, which can cause a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). This, in turn, can cause hyponatremia and, subsequently, hyperkalemia. In addition, the medication can cause hemorrhagic cystitis, which may lead to renal tubular acidosis and, consequently, metabolic acidosis.

Option B is incorrect because cyclophosphamide doesn't cause metabolic alkalosis; it can cause metabolic acidosis due to renal tubular acidosis.

Option C is incorrect because chronic glucocorticoid therapy can cause hypokalemia, but the patient's cyclophosphamide therapy can cause hyperkalemia.

Option D is incorrect because the patient's cyclophosphamide therapy can cause metabolic acidosis, not metabolic alkalosis. 

Option E is incorrect because the patient's cyclophosphamide therapy can cause metabolic acidosis.

1442,"The correct answer is 'A: Decrease negative likelihood ratio of the Lyme disease assay'. 

Lyme disease is more prevalent in the northeastern United States, including Maine, than in Southern California. Therefore, the negative likelihood ratio (which is a measure of how well a test identifies those without the disease) would likely be lower in Southern California than in Maine. This is due to the lower prevalence of the disease; fewer people have the disease, so there are fewer true negatives (people who do not have the disease and are correctly identified by the test).

Option B is incorrect because the prevalence of the disease does not affect the likelihood that a patient without the disease truly has a negative test. This is determined by the specificity of the test, not its prevalence in a certain area. 

Option C is incorrect because the likelihood that an individual with a positive test truly has Lyme disease, known as the positive predictive value, is not determined by the prevalence of the disease in a particular area but by the sensitivity and specificity of the test.

Option D is incorrect because the positive likelihood ratio, which is a measure of how well a test identifies those with the disease, is not affected by the prevalence of the disease in a certain area.

Option E is incorrect because the likelihood that an individual with a negative test truly does not have the disease, known as the negative predictive value, depends on the sensitivity and specificity of the test, not the prevalence of the disease in a certain area.","stop","the correct answer is 'a: decrease negative likelihood ratio of the lyme disease assay'.","A","E","USMLE question: A new assay for Lyme disease has been developed. While the assay has been tested extensively in Maine, a group of inventors are planning to test it in Southern California. In comparison to the assay's performance in Maine, testing the assay in Southern California would affect the performance of the assay in which of the following ways?
Option: {'A': 'Decrease negative likelihood ratio of the Lyme disease assay', 'B': 'Lower likelihood that a patient without Lyme disease truly has a negative test', 'C': 'Greater likelihood that an individual with a positive test will truly have Lyme disease', 'D': 'Decreased positive likelihood ratio of the Lyme disease assay', 'E': 'Greater likelihood that an individual with a negative test will truly not have Lyme disease\n""'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The answer to this question would be 'D: Decreased positive likelihood ratio of the Lyme disease assay'.

The Positive Likelihood Ratio (PLR) in diagnostic testing is the probability of a positive test result in individuals with the disease compared to the probability of a positive test result in individuals without the disease. It measures how much the odds of the disease increase when a test is positive.

Lyme disease is more prevalent in Maine than in Southern California. Therefore, the probability of a true positive (people with Lyme disease who test positive) will be higher in Maine due to higher disease prevalence. Conversely, in Southern California, where the disease prevalence is lower, the probability of false positives (people without Lyme disease who test positive) will increase due to lower disease prevalence.

Therefore, the positive likelihood ratio (PLR = True positive rate / False positive rate) will decrease due to the lower numerator (True positive rate) and higher denominator (False positive rate) when the assay is used in Southern California.

Now, let's discuss why the other options are incorrect:

A: The negative likelihood ratio (NLR = False negative rate / True negative rate) should not change significantly as it's mostly influenced by the specificity of the test, not the disease prevalence.

B: The probability that a patient without Lyme disease truly has a negative test is the specificity of the test, which should not be affected by changing the testing region.

C: The lower prevalence of Lyme disease in Southern California would decrease the post-test probability of disease, meaning there is a 'lower' not 'greater' likelihood that an individual with a positive test will truly have disease (aka positive predictive value).

E: Changing the testing region from Maine to Southern California should not significantly affect the likelihood that an individual with a negative test will truly not have Lyme disease (aka negative predictive value).

1450,"The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is 'A': Anterior nasal packing with topical antibiotics.

The majority of nosebleeds (epistaxis) are anterior and arise from Kiesselbach plexus, a vascular network in the anteroinferior part of the nasal septum. Anterior nosebleeds typically present with bleeding from one nostril. Most can be treated with direct pressure alone. However, if direct pressure fails, as in this patient, chemical cauterization with silver nitrate or application of a topical vasoconstrictor (eg, oxymetazoline) followed by anterior nasal packing can be performed. The decision depends on whether the bleeding site can be identified. If the site can be visualized, silver nitrate cautery is preferred. If the site is not visualizable, anterior packing is performed. However, following packing, patients should receive prophylactic systemic antibiotics to prevent sinusitis and toxic shock syndrome. 

Option 'B', 'Intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin', is incorrect because nitroglycerin is a vasodilator and would be inappropriate in a setting of active bleeding.

Option 'C', 'Nasal oxymetazoline', is incorrect because it is a topical vasoconstrictor and it is usually used before nasal packing. But in this case, it was not effective in stopping the bleeding.

Option 'D', 'Oral captopril', is incorrect because while this medication can help control the patient's hypertension, it is not the immediate treatment needed to stop the nosebleed.

Option 'E', 'Silver nitrate cauterization of the bleeding vessel', is incorrect because this procedure is usually done when the site of bleeding can be visualized, which is not the case in this patient.","stop","the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is 'a': anterior nasal packing with topical antibiotics.","A","C","USMLE question: A 56-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a 1-hour history of persistent nasal bleeding.

Her blood pressure is 175/88 mm Hg. During the examination, the patient holds a blood-stained gauze against her right nostril. Upon removal of the gauze, blood slowly drips down from her right nostril. Examination of the left nostril reveals no abnormalities. Squeezing the nostrils for 20 minutes fails to control bleeding.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is A: Anterior nasal packing with topical antibiotics.

This patient's presentation is consistent with a common type of nosebleed known as anterior epistaxis. The most common site of this is the Kiesselbach plexus, a vascular network in the anteroinferior part of the nasal septum. In majority of anterior epistaxis, direct pressure alone is sufficient to stop bleeding, but if it doesn't work, the next step is anterior nasal packing. Topical antibiotics such as mupirocin or bacitracin are often applied to prevent secondary infection.

Option B: Intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin is incorrect. Nitroglycerin is a vasodilator used in the management of chest pain due to coronary artery disease. It is not appropriate in this case.

Option C: Nasal oxymetazoline is incorrect. Although it can provide temporary relief due to its vasoconstrictive properties, it is not the next best step after failed direct pressure in anterior epistaxis.

1471,"The correct answer is E: Measure serum C-peptide concentration.

This patient's recurrent episodes of symptomatic hypoglycemia, especially the very low glucose levels, require a workup for possible insulinoma or factitious hypoglycemia due to surreptitious insulin use. Insulinoma is a rare insulin-secreting pancreatic tumor that can cause hypoglycemia. Factitious hypoglycemia is a self-induced hypoglycemia caused by the surreptitious use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. This patient's episodes of hypoglycemia are not likely to be due to her diabetes treatment as she is only taking metformin, which does not cause hypoglycemia.

The diagnosis of insulinoma vs. factitious hypoglycemia can be made by measuring serum insulin, C-peptide, and sulfonylurea levels during a hypoglycemic episode. In insulinoma, both insulin and C-peptide levels are increased because the tumor autonomously secretes insulin. In factitious hypoglycemia due to insulin use, the insulin level is high but C-peptide is low or undetectable because exogenous insulin suppresses endogenous insulin secretion.

As for the other options:

A: Reporting the patient to her employer would not be appropriate at this stage. The patient's hypoglycemia could be due to a medical condition (eg, insulinoma) and not necessarily surreptitious insulin use.

B: Asking the patient if she is taking any medications other than metformin may not yield truthful answers, especially if the hypoglycemia is self-induced.

C: Searching the patient's belongings for insulin may be a violation of her privacy.

The only medication listed in her history is metformin. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Option: {'A': 'Report the patient to her employer', 'B': 'Ask the patient if she is taking any medications other than metformin', 'C': ""Search the patient's belongings for insulin"", 'D': 'Measure glycated hemoglobin concentration', 'E': 'Measure serum C-peptide concentration'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The most appropriate next step in this case would be option 'E': Measure serum C-peptide concentration. 

This patient's symptoms of sweating, tremors, and nausea are suggestive of hypoglycemia which is confirmed by her low glucose measurements. The common causes of hypoglycemia in diabetics include insulin overdose, renal insufficiency (which can increase levels of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents), alcohol consumption, and certain medications (eg, salicylates, sulfa antibiotics). However, this patient is only on metformin which does not typically cause hypoglycemia because it does not increase insulin secretion. 

Therefore, her recurrent hypoglycemia is suspicious for self-administration of insulin or insulin secretagogues. In addition to the above clinical context, the presence of a psychiatric disorder (borderline personality disorder) in which factitious disorder is more common, increases the suspicion for factitious hypoglycemia due to surreptitious insulin use. C-peptide is a byproduct of endogenous insulin production, and is therefore low in patients with factitious hypoglycemia secondary to exogenous insulin use. However, it is high or normal in patients with factitious hypoglycemia secondary to use of insulin secretagogues.

Option 'A': Reporting the patient to her employer, could have negative implications for the patient and may not be the appropriate first step given the current evidence. 

Option 'B': Asking the patient if she is taking any other medications may be helpful, but individuals with factitious disorder may not always reveal this information.

Option 'C': Searching the patient's belongings for insulin without her consent would be a breach of patient privacy and it's not the most appropriate next step.

Option 'D': Measuring glycated hemoglobin concentration (HbA1c) could determine average blood glucose control over a period of weeks to months, but it may not identify current hypoglycemic episodes or the cause of these episodes."
1475,"This patient's increased intraocular pressure is suggestive of glaucoma. Medications for glaucoma often decrease intraocular pressure by reducing aqueous humor production or increasing its outflow. However, some of these medications may have systemic side effects that can be harmful to patients with certain conditions. In this patient with significant cardiac dysfunction, a medication that can exacerbate heart failure should be avoided. Timolol, a non-selective beta-blocker used in glaucoma, decreases the production of aqueous humor by the ciliary epithelium. However, systemic absorption of timolol can decrease heart rate and contractility, potentially worsening heart failure. Beta-blockers work by decreasing intracellular cyclic AMP levels (option B), which decreases the rate and force of heart contractions.

Option A is incorrect because acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that alters bicarbonate metabolism to decrease aqueous humor production, does not exacerbate heart failure. Option C is incorrect because no common glaucoma medications increase intracellular calcium levels, which would actually increase heart contractility.

1480,"The patient's history of color changes in her fingers associated with exposure to cold is characteristic of Raynaud's phenomenon. This is due to spasm of small blood vessels and can be either primary (idiopathic) or secondary to a variety of conditions. Raynaud's phenomenon is particularly common in connective tissue diseases such as systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) and is usually the earliest manifestation.

Systemic sclerosis is a chronic systemic disease of unknown cause characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, and vascular abnormalities in the skin, joints, and internal organs (particularly the GI tract, lungs, heart, and kidneys). The CREST syndrome is a variant of systemic sclerosis characterized by the following features:

This is because some vaccines, such as the influenza vaccine, are manufactured using egg-based technology and may contain a small amount of egg proteins. In individuals with a severe egg allergy, this could potentially trigger an allergic reaction. However, most people with egg allergy can receive the influenza vaccine without any problems, but it should be given in a medical setting with supervision by a healthcare provider who can recognize and manage severe allergic reactions.

Option A, 'Fever of 38.2Â°C (100.7Â°F) following previous vaccinations', is not a contraindication for future vaccinations. It is common to have a mild fever after vaccination, which usually resolves within a day or two.

Option B, 'History of cystic fibrosis', is not a contraindication for vaccinations. In fact, it is especially important for individuals with cystic fibrosis to stay up-to-date with vaccinations because they are at a higher risk for respiratory infections.

Option D, 'History of febrile seizures', is not a contraindication for vaccinations. Although febrile seizures can be scary, they are usually harmless and don't cause any long-term health problems.

Option D (History of febrile seizures) is not a contraindication. While febrile seizures can be scary, they are relatively common in children and are not associated with long-term health problems. Moreover, the benefits of immunization far outweigh the potential risk of triggering a febrile seizure.

Option E (History of intussusception) is not a contraindication. However, it's worth noting that the live, oral rotavirus vaccine has been associated with a small increased risk of intussusception, especially after the first dose.

1490,"The correct answer is 'A: There is a 100% he will be affected, but the severity may be different'. The child's presentation of motor regression, episodes of shaking (possible myoclonic seizures), and muscle biopsy findings of red ragged fibers are highly suggestive of a mitochondrial disorder, such as MELAS syndrome (Mitochondrial Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes). Mitochondrial diseases are inherited in a maternal (mitochondrial) pattern. In this mode of inheritance, all offspring of an affected mother will inherit the disease, but the severity may vary widely because of heteroplasmy (a variable mixture of normal and abnormal mitochondrial DNA in different tissues). Therefore, the other son, being a child of the same mother, will also be affected but the severity of his symptoms could be different.

The child described in the question likely has a mitochondrial disease such as MELAS (Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes). This is suggested by the child's regression in motor development, episodes of shaking (possibly seizures), and the red ragged fibers seen on muscle biopsy (a classic feature of mitochondrial myopathies). 

Mitochondrial diseases are inherited in a maternal pattern because the vast majority of a cell's mitochondria are inherited from the egg, not the sperm. Therefore, siblings of an affected individual have a high likelihood of also being affected if the mother is a carrier of the disease. However, because the disease is maternally inherited, the risk would apply only to the patient's siblings from the same mother. Since the question asks about the patient's brother and assuming they have the same mother and father, the brother will be unaffected because he would have inherited his mitochondria from his mother, not his affected brother.

Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect because they all imply that there is some risk of the brother inheriting the mitochondrial disease from his affected brother, which is not the case since mitochondria (and thus mitochondrial diseases) are maternally inherited."

Elevated PSA and abnormal DRE findings are suggestive of prostate cancer. However, prostate cancer typically has a slow rate of progression and will often not become clinically significant in a patient's lifetime, particularly in an elderly patient with multiple comorbidities. In this patient, the benefits of diagnosing and treating prostate cancer are unlikely to outweigh the risks and potential complications of a biopsy (e.g., bleeding, infection, urinary retention). Therefore, pursuing diagnostic evaluation would not change management and can be deferred.  

Option A, CT abdomen and pelvis, is not the next step in evaluating elevated PSA and abnormal DRE. CT scans are generally performed in prostate cancer staging for patients who are at high risk of metastasis, not for initial diagnosis.

Option B, Cystourethroscopy, is not indicated in this patient. It is typically used for evaluation of lower urinary tract symptoms, hematuria, or suspected bladder cancer.

Option C, Transrectal prostate biopsy, is typically recommended for further evaluation of an elevated PSA or abnormal DRE, especially in younger patients or those with longer life expectancy. However, in this patient with advanced age and multiple comorbidities, it might not be beneficial.

Option E, Repeat PSA test, could be considered, but it's not the best option here.

Option A, CT abdomen and pelvis, is typically used to assess for metastasis in patients with established prostate cancer and is not used for primary diagnosis. Therefore, a CT scan would be premature at this point.

Option B, Cystourethroscopy, is primarily used to evaluate the lower urinary tract (ie, bladder and urethra) and is not typically used to diagnose prostate cancer.

Option D, Reassurance, is not the correct choice because the patient has findings on physical examination combined with an elevated PSA, both of which are concerning for prostate cancer. Simply reassuring the patient without further investigation would be inappropriate.

Option E, Repeat PSA test, might be appropriate if the patient had an elevated PSA but a normal prostate examination. However, because his prostate is abnormal on examination, further investigation should not be delayed."
1503,"This patient's presentation of numbness in the first 3.5 digits, tingling elicited by percussion of the wrist (positive Tinel sign), and inability to flex the first 3 digits (indicating median nerve motor dysfunction) suggests carpal tunnel syndrome due to a lunate dislocation. The lunate is the most commonly dislocated carpal bone and is often the result of a fall onto an outstretched hand. Dislocation can cause acute carpal tunnel syndrome due to median nerve compression.

Option: {'A': 'Scaphoid fracture', 'B': 'Lunate dislocation', 'C': 'Fracture of distal radius', 'D': 'Palmar aponeurosis tear', 'E': 'Interosseous ligament rupture'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's wrist pain, numbness in the medial 3 digits, and tingling with tapping the anterior wrist (positive Tinel's sign) suggest median nerve injury at the level of the wrist. The median nerve innervates the first and second lumbricals, which flex the metacarpophalangeal joints and extend the interphalangeal joints of the radial two digits. As a result, an isolated median nerve injury at the wrist would cause loss of thumb opposition and decreased flexion of the radial (lateral) two digits. However, this patient's inability to flex the medial three digits suggests concomitant injury to the flexor muscles of these digits. These muscles (flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus) are located in the forearm and are innervated proximal to the wrist; therefore, they would not be affected by an isolated wrist-level median nerve injury. The most likely cause of median nerve and forearm flexor muscle injury is a distal radius fracture. These fractures are most common in older patients with osteoporosis, but they also can occur in younger patients due to high-impact trauma (eg, fall from a height, motor vehicle accident). 

Option A: A scaphoid fracture is usually tender in the anatomic snuffbox and does not typically cause numbness in the fingers.

Option B: Lunate dislocation can cause acute carpal tunnel syndrome, but it doesn't cause inability to flex the medial three digits.

Option D: Palmar aponeurosis tear, also known as Dupuytren contracture, is more chronic and would not result from acute trauma.

Option E: Interosseous ligament rupture, as in the case of Essex-Lopresti injury, typically presents with forearm pain and instability between the radius and ulna, not with the symptoms described in the vignette.

This dilation can cause a multitude of symptoms, including urinary incontinence and a broad-based gait, both of which this patient is experiencing. 

Option A is not likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms as these are not normal changes associated with aging. Option B, increased cerebrospinal fluid production, and Option C, decreased cerebrospinal fluid absorption, could theoretically cause hydrocephalus. However, these are not the typical mechanisms by which NPH occurs. NPH is usually due to an obstruction in the flow of CSF, not overproduction or under-absorption of CSF.

The guidelines recommend repeat cytology and HPV co-testing in 12 months, or immediately testing for type 16 and 18 HPV. Since the patient has already tested positive for HPV, immediate type 16 and 18 HPV testing would not change management, making option D incorrect.

Options A, B, and C (cryoablation, loop electrosurgical excision procedure [LEEP], and cold-knife conization) are typically reserved for patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) or CIN 2/3, as these lesions have a much higher risk of progression to invasive cancer.

In this case, because the initial Pap smear showed high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion but the biopsy only confirmed CIN 1, the discrepancy is managed by repeating cytology and HPV co-testing in 6 months to closely monitor the situation. The test might have been a false positive and another test would be helpful to either confirm or rule out the presence of a high grade lesion."
1583,"The USMLE question is asking about the properties of a normal distribution, also known as a bell curve. A normal distribution is symmetric and its mean, median, and mode are all equal. The standard deviation measures the dispersion or spread of the distribution.

In a normal distribution:
- Approximately 68% of the values fall within 1 standard deviation from the mean (mean Â± 1SD)
- Approximately 95% of the values fall within 2 standard deviations from the mean (mean Â± 2SD)
- Approximately 99.7% of the values fall within 3 standard deviations from the mean (mean Â± 3SD)

In this case, the mean LDL is 200 mg/dL and the standard deviation is 50 mg/dL. Therefore:
- 68% of the population has an LDL between 150 and 250 mg/dL (200 Â± 50)
- 95% of the population has an LDL between 100 and 300 mg/dL (200 Â± 2*50)
- 99.7% of the population has an LDL between 50 and 350 mg/dL (200 Â± 3*50)

Hence, approximately 95% of the population (or 950 out of 1000 participants) has a cholesterol level less than 300 mg/dL.

So, the correct answer is 'C': 950.

- 'A': 680 would be correct if the question asked for the number of people within 1 standard deviation from the mean.
- 'B': 840 is not related to any specific standard deviation boundary in a normal distribution.

1596,"The correct answer is 'B': Probe A: -4 mm Hg; Probe B: 0 mm Hg.

Explanation:

The pressure in the pleural space (where Probe A is located) is normally negative relative to atmospheric pressure. This is because the lung's natural tendency to recoil inward is balanced by the chest wall's tendency to recoil outward. The negative pressure is about -5 mm Hg at the end of expiration and slightly less, about -4 mm Hg, at the end of inspiration. 

The pressure within the alveoli (where Probe B is located) is equal to atmospheric pressure at the end of inspiration, when there is no air flow. During inspiration, the pressure inside the alveoli momentarily drops below atmospheric pressure, causing air to flow in. Once the air flow stops, pressure inside the alveoli equals atmospheric pressure, giving a reading of 0 mm Hg.

Therefore, options 'A', 'C', 'D', and 'E' are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the pressure conditions within the pleural space and the alveoli at the end of inspiration.","stop","the correct answer is 'b': probe a: -4 mm hg; probe b: 0 mm hg.","B","D","USMLE question: A 35-year-old woman volunteers for a study on respiratory physiology.

Firstly, the intrapleural pressure (Probe A) is always negative with respect to atmospheric pressure, even at the end of inspiration. This negative pressure is required to keep the lungs inflated. The intrapleural pressure is approximately -4 to -6mm Hg at the end of inspiration.

Secondly, the alveolar pressure (Probe B) is 0 mm Hg at the end of inspiration. This is because during the process of inspiration, the pressure gradient drives air into the lungs until the alveolar pressure equals atmospheric pressure, which is defined as 0 mm Hg. 

Therefore, the answer is B: 'Probe A: -4 mm Hg; Probe B: 0 mm Hg'.

1619,"This patient's proximal muscle weakness, elevated creatine kinase (CK), and transaminases likely indicate a myopathy. The differential diagnosis for myopathy is broad and includes inflammatory, infectious, metabolic, or drug-related causes. Inflammatory myopathies (eg, polymyositis, dermatomyositis) often present with progressive, symmetric proximal muscle weakness and are associated with elevated CK, transaminases, and inflammatory markers (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate). However, the absence of typical features such as skin rash (eg, heliotrope rash, Gottron's papules in dermatomyositis) and ""mechanic's hands"" (in antisynthetase syndrome) makes this diagnosis less likely. 

Statins can cause myopathy that is typically painless and proximal. It may occur at any time during therapy, and it can be associated with mild CK elevation. However, high CK (>10 times the upper limit of normal) and symptoms of weakness as seen in this patient suggest a more severe statin-induced necrotizing autoimmune myopathy (SINAM). SINAM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and extremely high CK levels that do not improve despite statin cessation.

1636,"The correct answer is B. Progesterone.

The patient's presentation of calf swelling, redness, pain, and a positive Homan's sign (pain with passive dorsiflexion of the foot) is suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state due to increased levels of procoagulant factors (eg, fibrinogen, factors VII, VIII, X), decreased levels of anticoagulant proteins (eg, protein S), and decreased fibrinolysis. Progesterone-induced venous stasis also contributes to this hypercoagulability. The reduced venous tone and venous return result in dilation of the veins in the lower extremities, leading to pooling of blood and subsequently, an increased risk of thrombus formation.

A. Estriol is a weak estrogen produced in large amounts during pregnancy. It is not implicated in DVT during pregnancy.

1654,"The patient's presentation of sudden-onset shortness of breath, hypotension, crackles at both lung bases, and an S3 gallop, in conjunction with ST-segment elevation on ECG, is consistent with an acute myocardial infarction (MI). Acute MIs can lead to decreased cardiac output, resulting in tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxia. When tissues are hypoperfused, they switch from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism, leading to lactic acid production and lactic acidosis, as evidenced by this patient's high lactic acid level and low pH (acidemia).

This process is due to defective mitochondrial oxygen utilization (option D), as oxygen is necessary for aerobic metabolism to occur in the mitochondria. When oxygen supply is insufficient, as in the case of an MI, the mitochondria cannot adequately produce ATP through the electron transport chain, leading to a buildup of NADH and pyruvate. Pyruvate is then converted to lactate, leading to lactic acidosis. 

Option A: Catecholamine stimulation of glycolysis isn't the primary cause of the lactic acidosis, rather it's the lack of oxygen causing the shift to anaerobic metabolism. 

Option B: Decreased reabsorption of HCO3- would cause a metabolic acidosis, not lactic acidosis. Additionally, the kidneys would typically increase reabsorption of bicarbonate in response to acidemia, not decrease it.

This patient's laboratory changes, including a low pH (acidemia), normal pCO2, low bicarbonate (HCO3-), and elevated lactate, indicate the presence of lactic acidosis, which typically occurs in states of tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxia - such as in the case of AMI.

The correct answer is D: 'Defective mitochondrial oxygen utilization.' In a state of tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxia, as it occurs during an AMI, anaerobic metabolism is relied upon for energy production. Under aerobic conditions, pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis, enters the mitochondria to undergo the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. However, when tissue oxygen delivery is impaired, the oxidation of NADH in the electron transport chain is reduced. This impairs the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, causing pyruvate to be converted instead to lactate, thereby leading to lactic acidosis.

A: 'Catecholamine stimulation of glycolysis' - Catecholamines would indeed increase glycolysis, but this is not the primary reason for the patient's lactic acidosis in this case.
B: 'Decreased reabsorption of HCO3-' - This refers to a renal process, and while it can cause a metabolic acidosis, it wouldn't cause an increase in lactate.
C: 'Increased activity of HMG-CoA lyase' - This enzyme is involved in ketogenesis, not lactic acidosis.

1664,"The correct answer is 'E: Single-stranded binding proteins'. 

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a laboratory technique used to amplify a specific DNA sequence, making it a valuable tool for diagnosing genetic diseases such as sickle cell trait. PCR involves several steps: denaturation, annealing, and extension. During the denaturation step, the DNA double helix is separated into two single strands by heating. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding proteins are then required to prevent these strands from reannealing, thus keeping them available for the next steps of the PCR process.

C: The initial sequence of the 3' end of a DNA strand (also known as a primer) is indeed necessary for PCR. However, it's not the answer in this case because the question specifically refers to polymerase chain reaction testing for sickle cell trait, which involves a specific sequence in the beta-globin gene, rather than a general property of PCR.

The process involves the denaturation of the DNA into single strands, annealing of specific primers to the sequence of interest, and elongation of these primers by a DNA polymerase. Single-stranded binding proteins are essential in PCR to prevent the reannealing of the DNA strands after denaturation, allowing the primers to anneal to their complementary sequences on the single-stranded templates. 

Option A, RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, is not required for PCR. This is an enzyme used in retroviral replication, not in PCR.

Option B, ligation of Okazaki fragments, is a step in DNA replication. Okazaki fragments are short fragments of DNA that are synthesized on the lagging strand during DNA replication. These fragments are later joined together by DNA ligase. However, this process is not involved in PCR.

Option C, initial sequence of the 3' end of a DNA strand, might be confusing because the DNA polymerase used in PCR does need a 3' end to begin synthesis. However, this 3' end is provided by the primers, not by the original DNA strand.

Option D, complete genome DNA sequence, is also not necessary for PCR. PCR only needs to know the sequence of the small region being amplified, which is targeted by the primers."
1668,"The most appropriate next step in management for this patient is option C: External cephalic version (ECV).

ECV is the process of turning a fetus from a breech position or side-lying (transverse) position into a head-down (vertex) position before labor begins. It is usually attempted after 37 weeks of gestation when the baby is mature enough to be delivered should complications occur. The patient is at 34 weeks gestation and is asymptomatic, hence, no immediate intervention is required. But, the plan should be to perform ECV at 37 weeks if the fetus remains in breech presentation. If ECV is unsuccessful or if the fetus reverts to a breech presentation, a cesarean section would then be planned because vaginal delivery of a breech fetus is associated with increased risk for cord prolapse, birth trauma, and perinatal mortality.

Option A: Internal cephalic version is an obsolete, risky procedure where a hand is inserted through the cervix to turn the fetus. It is not done routinely due to the risks involved.

Option B: Cesarean section is usually indicated if a fetus remains in breech presentation at term, or if ECV fails. However, at this point in her pregnancy, it is too early to decide on a cesarean section as the fetus might spontaneously turn to a vertex presentation.

Option D: Observation could be considered, as spontaneous version can occur, however active management (i.e., planning an ECV at 37 weeks) is preferred to passive management (i.e., observing and hoping for spontaneous version).

Option E: Intravenous penicillin is not indicated as there is no sign of Group B streptococcus infection, preterm labor, or premature rupture of membranes, conditions which could warrant the use of this antibiotic.","stop","the most appropriate next step in management for this patient is option c: external cephalic version (ecv).","C","D","USMLE question: A 35-year-old woman, gravida 4, para 3, at 34 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a prenatal visit.

External cephalic version (ECV) is a procedure used to try to turn a fetus from a breech position into a head-down (vertex) position before labor begins. It's usually done after 36 weeks of gestation, but may be attempted at 34 weeks. ECV has a 58% success rate and can significantly reduce the rate of cesarean delivery. In this case, the woman is 34 weeks pregnant and the fetus is in a breech position, so ECV would be the next appropriate step.

Option A, Internal cephalic version, is incorrect because this procedure involves manually turning the baby from inside the uterus, which is usually done during labor if the baby is in a breech position. It's not typically done as a first-line intervention before labor.

Option B, Cesarean section, is not the first-line management for breech presentation, especially when there is no labor. It is generally reserved for cases where ECV has failed or is contraindicated, or when labor has already begun and complications occur.

Option D, Observation, is not suitable because the fetus is in a breech position, which can lead to complications during delivery if not corrected.

Hospice care is focused on providing comfort, relieving symptoms, and supporting patients with serious, life-limiting illnesses who are not expected to survive beyond six months. It does not involve curative treatments and generally includes a ""do not resuscitate"" (DNR) order. Therefore, a patient's wish to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) disqualifies him from receiving hospice care, as it goes against the philosophy of end-of-life comfort care.

Option 'C': Uncertain coverage by health insurance does not disqualify a patient from hospice care. While it may affect the patient's ability to pay for care, it's not a determining factor for eligibility.

Option 'D': The son's objection doesn't disqualify the patient from hospice care. While family input is valued, it doesn't override the patient's autonomous decision, provided he is mentally competent.

Hospice care is an approach to treatment that specifically focuses on the quality of life for people who are facing a life-limiting illness or injury. It involves a team-oriented approach to expert medical care, pain management, and emotional and spiritual support. Hospice care is typically used when curative treatments are no longer effective, or the patient has chosen not to pursue them.

In order to be eligible for hospice care, a patient must typically accept the palliative nature of the care, meaning they are not pursuing curative treatments and have a limited life expectancy. This typically includes a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order, as resuscitation is considered a life-prolonging treatment. Therefore, this patient's wish for cardiopulmonary resuscitation disqualifies him from receiving hospice care. 

As for the other options:

'A': Lack of a living will does not disqualify a patient from hospice care. A living will is a legal document that specifies what actions should be taken for their health if they are no longer able to make decisions due to illness or incapacity, but is not a requirement for hospice care.

'C': Uncertain coverage by health insurance does not determine eligibility for hospice care. While it may affect the patient's ability to afford hospice care, it does not disqualify him from pursuing it.

'D': The son's objection does not disqualify the patient from receiving hospice care. As the patient is still mentally competent, he has the right to make his own health care decisions, regardless of his son's power of attorney.

This woman's symptoms of insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness in a new time zone, followed by extreme fatigue, muscle soreness, and bloating after returning home, are classic for jet lag disorder. Jet lag disorder is a circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder that results from rapid travel across multiple time zones (eg, Los Angeles to Hong Kong), which desynchronizes the individual's internal body clock from the local environment. Treatment involves behavioral strategies to reset the internal circadian clock to the new time zone. These strategies include appropriately timed bright light exposure and adjusting sleep schedule prior to travel (when possible). In addition, taking melatonin can help shift the timing of the sleep-wake cycle in the new time zone.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's symptoms of difficulty falling asleep after travel, feeling unrefreshfully sleepy the next day, and experiencing transient physical symptoms (eg, weakness, muscle soreness, abdominal distension) upon returning home are consistent with jet lag disorder. Jet lag disorder is a circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder that occurs due to the misalignment between the timing of the individual's internal circadian clock and the environmental clock of the new time zone. The severity of symptoms is usually proportional to the number of time zones crossed. Eastward travel (as in this case) typically causes more severe jet lag than westward travel because it is easier for our internal clocks to delay (ie, stay up late) than to advance (ie, go to bed early). Nonpharmacologic recommendations include, maximizing outdoor light exposure in the early morning and minimizing it in the late afternoon and evening, maintaining a regular sleep-wake schedule, and avoiding heavy meals and exercise close to bedtime. If nonpharmacologic interventions are not successful, the next step would be a short course of a nonbenzodiazepine sleep aid (eg, zolpidem) or melatonin, both of which have demonstrated efficacy in alleviating the sleep disturbance and daytime symptoms of jet lag.
Polysomnography (option A) would be indicated if there was suspicion for a primary sleep disorder such as obstructive sleep apnea or periodic limb movement disorder, which do not appear to be the case here.
Escitalopram (option B) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor indicated for depression and generalized anxiety disorder; it is not first-line treatment for jet lag.
Temazepam (option C) is a benzodiazepine used for insomnia; however, due to the risk of dependency and tolerance, it is not first-line treatment for jet lag.
Therefore, the correct answer is Zolpidem (option D), a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic that acts on benzodiazepine receptors and is commonly used to treat insomnia without the risk of dependency seen with benzodiazepines like temazepam.

1734,"The patient's unilateral facial pain, described as stinging and burning in nature, is suggestive of trigeminal neuralgia (TN), a disorder characterized by severe paroxysmal facial pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve (CN V). It is particularly common in patients with multiple sclerosis due to demyelination of the trigeminal root entry zone near the pons. The pain is often triggered by nonpainful stimuli such as a light touch or breeze (ie, allodynia). Triggers often include actions such as talking, chewing, or brushing teeth; however, it may also occur spontaneously. Although the exact cause is unclear, it is believed to be due to ectopic generation of action potentials in the trigeminal nerve root.
First-line treatment for TN is carbamazepine, which stabilizes voltage-gated sodium channels in the inactivated state, thereby reducing ectopic neural discharge. When carbamazepine is contraindicated or ineffective, other options include gabapentin, phenytoin, or surgery (eg, microvascular decompression, rhizotomy).

Amitriptyline (Option B) is used in the treatment of depression, neuropathic pain, and chronic tension-type headache, but it is not first-line therapy for TN.
Oral acyclovir (Option C) is used for treating herpes simplex and varicella-zoster infections. This patient's lack of a rash or vesicles makes herpes zoster (shingles) unlikely.
Topical corticosteroids (Option D) would not be helpful in this patient's case as she does not have any skin changes.
Gabapentin (Option E) can be used as a second-line treatment for TN, but carbamazepine is typically tried first.

So, the answer is A. Carbamazepine.","stop","so, the answer is a. carbamazepine.","A","C","USMLE question: A 61-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician complaining of left-sided facial pain that started yesterday. She describes the pain as stinging, burning, and constant. It does not worsen with jaw movement or chewing. Her past medical history includes hyperlipidemia and multiple sclerosis (MS), and she had chickenpox as a child but received a shingles vaccination last year. Medications include simvastatin and glatiramer acetate. The patientÃ¢â?¬â?¢s last MS flare was 5 weeks ago, at which time she received a prednisone burst with taper. At this visit, her temperature is 99.9 Ã?Â°F (37.7Ã?Â°C), blood pressure is 139/87 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, and respirations are 14/min. On exam, there is no rash or skin change on either side of the patientÃ¢â?¬â?¢s face. Gentle palpation of the left cheek and mandible produce significant pain, but there is full range of motion in the jaw. Which of the following medications is the most likely to prevent long-term persistence of this patientÃ¢â?¬â?¢s pain?
Option: {'A': 'Carbamazepine', 'B': 'Amitriptyline', 'C': 'Oral acyclovir', 'D': 'Topical corticosteroids', 'E': 'Gabapentin'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's left-sided facial pain, described as stinging and burning, in the absence of a rash or skin changes is suggestive of trigeminal neuralgia (TN). TN is classically described as sudden, severe, brief, stabbing recurrent episodes of pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. It most often occurs in the second and third divisions of the nerve (maxillary and mandibular), which can be confused with dental pain. Triggers such as touching the face or cold air can precipitate the pain, but patients may also have spontaneous unprovoked attacks.

TN is often associated with multiple sclerosis, likely due to demyelination of the trigeminal sensory root entry zone. The diagnosis of TN is generally clinical and does not require imaging unless there are atypical features (eg, onset <40 years old, bilateral symptoms, sensory loss, involvement of another cranial nerve, lack of refractoriness to treatment). First-line treatment includes carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine.

Now let's discuss the incorrect options:
- Amitriptyline: Although amitriptyline can be used to treat neuropathic pain, it would not be first-line for trigeminal neuralgia.
- Oral acyclovir: Oral acyclovir would be used for an outbreak of herpes zoster (shingles), but this patient's symptoms and lack of rash do not suggest shingles.
- Topical corticosteroids: Topical corticosteroids would be used for skin inflammation or a rash, neither of which this patient has.
- Gabapentin: Gabapentin can be used to treat neuropathic pain, but it would not be first-line for trigeminal neuralgia. Gabapentin is usually used when patients cannot tolerate or do not get relief from carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine.

Therefore, the correct answer is Carbamazepine (Option A)."
1738,"This patient's symptoms of chronic, burning chest pain with intermittent electric shock-like sensations, hyperesthesia, and a preceding vesicular rash are suggestive of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). PHN is a complication of herpes zoster (shingles) that persists beyond 1-3 months after the resolution of the rash. The pain of PHN can be severe and may interfere with activities of daily living. First-line treatment options for PHN include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (Option B), gabapentin or pregabalin, and topical lidocaine patches or capsaicin. TCAs (eg, nortriptyline, desipramine) are often used first-line due to their low cost, but they have potential side effects (eg, anticholinergic effects, orthostatic hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias) that may limit their use in the elderly.

Option A (Sublingual nitrates) is used for acute angina relief, not for chronic neuropathic pain.

Option C (Oral famciclovir) is an antiviral medication used in the acute treatment of herpes zoster. This patient's rash has resolved, indicating the active infection is over. Antiviral therapy at this stage would not affect his chronic pain.

Option D (Intrathecal glucocorticoids) is not a common or first-line treatment for PHN.

PHN is a complication of herpes zoster, which is caused by reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus (eg, chickenpox) in the sensory root ganglia. PHN is the most common complication of herpes zoster in the elderly. Treatment is difficult and often unsatisfactory. First-line therapy includes tricyclic antidepressants (eg, nortriptyline), gabapentin, or pregabalin. Other options are capsaicin or lidocaine patch. 

The other options are not appropriate for this clinical scenario:
A. Sublingual nitrates would be used for acute angina, which does not match this patient's clinical picture.
C. Oral famciclovir would be used in the acute phase of herpes zoster to prevent PHN, but it would not benefit the patient in the postherpetic phase.
D. Evidence does not support the use of glucocorticoids for PHN.
E. Oral gabapentin would be appropriate for PHN, but the location of his pain (near the nipple) and the associated allodynia (inability to tolerate clothing) suggest that the pain is severe, which would necessitate initiation of therapy with a tricyclic antidepressant. Gabapentin can be added to the tricyclic antidepressant for refractory cases. Therefore, the correct answer would be B. Oral tricyclic antidepressants."

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's presentation of fever, chills, fatigue, myalgias and then shortness of breath, along with his recent exposure to a rodent-infested home, is suggestive of Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). Hantavirus is a virus carried by rodents, especially the deer mouse, and humans are usually infected by inhaling aerosolized virus from rodent urine, droppings, or saliva.

The correct answer is A: Binding to sialic acid residues in human cells. Hantaviruses bind to sialic acid residues on the surface of human cells, particularly in the lung. They are then internalized and begin to replicate. The resulting infection leads to increased vascular permeability and eventually to the symptoms of HCPS, which include fever, myalgias (especially of the thighs, hips, and back), headache, cough, shortness of breath (leading to respiratory failure), and cardiovascular shock.

Option B: Cerebral spinal fluid pleocytosis. This would be more indicative of a central nervous system infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis, which does not fit this patient's presentation.

Option C: Decreased serum albumin level. This could be seen in conditions like nephrotic syndrome or liver disease, which also do not fit this patient's clinical picture.

This patient's symptoms of unintended weight loss, decreased appetite, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain combined with findings of mild jaundice, hepatomegaly, polycythemia, and elevated alpha-fetoprotein suggest a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Chronic inflammation of the liver from viral hepatitis, alcohol, and other causes can lead to cirrhosis and HCC. Notably, HCC can sometimes produce erythropoietin, leading to secondary polycythemia as seen in this patient. 

In addition to alcohol and tobacco use, this patient's history of emigration from Malaysia one year ago raises the possibility of infection with Clonorchis sinensis, a trematode transmitted by the ingestion of undercooked or pickled freshwater fish.

Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), an X-linked disorder, is the most common type of phagocyte bactericidal defect and would likely be observed in a young boy. Patients with CGD have a deficiency of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase in their neutrophils and are unable to produce the superoxide anion, a reactive oxygen species crucial for intracellular killing of microbes. The nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test is used to diagnose CGD. In this test, a yellow, water-soluble NBT dye is added to a sample of the patient's white blood cells. In normal individuals, the dye is reduced to a dark blue, water-insoluble formazan as a result of the oxidative burst. Therefore, the neutrophils turn blue when viewed under a microscope. In CGD, the oxidative burst does not occur, the dye cannot be reduced, and the neutrophils do not turn blue.

1816,"The answer is E: Auscultate the abdomen. 

Abdominal pain is a common complaint, with many potential causes. The first step in evaluating abdominal pain is to determine the severity and nature of the pain, as well as any associated symptoms. Physical examination, including auscultation, can provide crucial information in this regard. Auscultation may reveal bowel sounds, which can indicate normal bowel activity, or lack of bowel sounds, which can suggest paralytic ileus or bowel obstruction.

Option A: Shifting dullness is a sign of ascites, which typically presents with gradual onset of abdominal distension and discomfort rather than acute, severe pain.

Option B: Percussion can be useful for determining the presence of air or fluid in the abdomen, but it is not typically the first step in evaluating acute abdominal pain. 

Option C: Light palpation at the point of maximal pain may be useful, but it is typically performed after auscultation to avoid altering bowel sounds. 

Option D: Deep palpation with quick release (also known as rebound tenderness) is used to assess for peritonitis, which can be a sign of a serious condition such as appendicitis.

Perforation of a gastric or duodenal ulcer can lead to chemical and then bacterial peritonitis, causing diffuse abdominal pain and tenderness. The rigid, board-like abdomen is due to reflex spasm of the abdominal wall muscles trying to prevent the spread of the inflammation. The correct next step in the physical examination of a patient with suspected peritonitis is gentle palpation at the point of maximal pain (Option C). This is because deep or aggressive palpation could potentially worsen the condition by causing further perforation or spread of the infection.

'Elicit shifting dullness of the abdomen' (Option A) is used to check for ascites, which is not suggested in this case based on the patient's history and physical exam findings.

'Percuss the point of maximal pain' (Option B) is not the best approach as it could potentially cause more pain without giving useful diagnostic information in this case.

The telangiectasias bleed easily, leading to recurrent nosebleeds and gastrointestinal bleeding, which can result in iron deficiency anemia. Additionally, patients with HHT are at risk for developing arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), particularly in the lungs, brain, and liver.

1852,"The correct answer is A. Thrombin inhibitor.

The patient's presentation and EKG findings are consistent with a ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). This is a medical emergency, and the patient is appropriately headed to the catheterization laboratory for reperfusion therapy. Adjunctive therapy with anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents is indicated to prevent further clot propagation or re-occlusion following reperfusion. In a patient with an aspirin allergy, the next best medication would be a Thrombin inhibitor such as heparin, which helps to prevent further clot formation.

Option B, phosphodiesterase activator, is incorrect because there is no such medication used in the management of a STEMI. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g., milrinone) are used in the management of heart failure, not acute coronary syndrome.

Option C, vitamin K epoxide reductase inhibitor, is also incorrect. Warfarin is a vitamin K epoxide reductase inhibitor and is not used in the acute phase of a STEMI due to its slow onset of action.

Option D, ADP receptor inhibitors (e.g., clopidogrel) are used as antiplatelet agents in the management of ACS. However, they are typically used in addition to aspirin, not as a replacement. As this patient is allergic to aspirin, an ADP receptor inhibitor alone may not provide sufficient antiplatelet effect.

Option E, cyclooxygenase activator, is incorrect as cyclooxygenase activation would promote thromboxane A2 production and platelet aggregation, which is counterproductive in the treatment of STEMI.

This patient's presentation of sub-sternal chest pain radiating to the jaw, ECG findings of ST elevations, and significant risk factors (including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cigarette smoking) for coronary artery disease are highly suggestive of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The first-line therapy for STEMI is reperfusion, and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred method if it can be performed in a timely manner, as is the plan for this patient. Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) should be administered as soon as possible to all patients with STEMI. However, this patient has an allergy to aspirin. Therefore, the next best antiplatelet agent is a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (eg, abciximab, eptifibatide, tirofiban), which is a potent antiplatelet agent that prevents fibrinogen and other adhesive molecules from binding to the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation. 

Option B is incorrect because Phosphodiesterase activators would increase cAMP levels in platelets, which would then enhance platelet aggregation, and this is not what we want in a thrombotic state like myocardial infarction.

Option C is incorrect because Vitamin K epoxide reductase inhibitors (eg, warfarin) are not initially used in acute STEMI. They take several days to become effective and are primarily used for long-term anticoagulation.

Option D is incorrect because ADP receptor inhibitors are another class of antiplatelet agents (eg, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor), but they are less potent than glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors.

Option E is incorrect because cyclooxygenase activators would enhance the synthesis of thromboxane A2 in platelets, leading to enhanced platelet aggregation. This is contra-indicated in a patient with myocardial infarction. 

Hence the most appropriate answer in this case is a thrombin inhibitor (e.g., heparin) which prevents the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, thereby preventing clot formation."
1853,"The correct answer is D. Deep femoral vein.

This patient's presentation is consistent with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), most commonly caused by Virchow's triad of stasis, hypercoagulability, and endothelial damage. The lower extremity venous system is divided into deep and superficial systems, which are connected by perforator veins. The deep system, which includes the deep femoral vein, is responsible for approximately 90% of venous return and is under high pressure. So, the deep femoral vein plays a crucial role in returning blood from the lower extremities to the heart, thereby preventing stasis and subsequent clot formation.

Option B, the perforator veins, connect the deep and superficial venous systems but do not directly prevent DVT. Option C, the accessory saphenous vein, is a superficial vein that does not contribute significantly to venous return.

The deep femoral vein drains the thigh and its muscles, carrying blood back towards the heart. Importantly, it also provides an alternative route of venous drainage for the lower limb if the femoral vein becomes obstructed, as seen in this patient with a distal femoral vein thrombosis. Therefore, the deep femoral vein is crucial in preventing and lessening the effects of conditions like deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Option A, the Giacomini vein, is an inconsistent (present in some people, absent in others) superficial vein that connects the great saphenous vein to the small saphenous vein. It is not directly involved in preventing DVT.

Option B, the perforator veins, connect the superficial and deep venous systems but are not alone sufficient to prevent DVT if a major vein like the femoral vein is obstructed.

Option C, the accessory saphenous vein, is a superficial vein and, while it does help drain the lower limb, it is not typically sufficient to prevent DVT if a major vein is obstructed.

Option E, the fibular vein, is a deep vein, but it drains the calf muscles and would not play a significant role in preventing DVT in the thigh."
1855,"The correct answer is 'D': Involuntary sustained twisting of neck.

This patient's medication, fluphenazine, is a typical antipsychotic. Typical antipsychotics are known to cause extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), such as Parkinsonian symptoms (tremors, bradykinesia), akathisia (restlessness), and dystonia (sustained muscle contractions). The involuntary sustained twisting of the neck, known as torticollis, is an example of acute dystonia. EPS are usually reversible with medication discontinuation or treatment with anticholinergics.

Here's why the other options are wrong:

A: Resting tremors: This is a feature of Parkinson's disease, not typically a side effect of antipsychotics.

B: Crossing and uncrossing legs constantly: This is indicative of restlessness or akathisia, which can be a side effect of antipsychotics. However, it's usually not the reason to discontinue an antipsychotic since it's manageable with dose reduction or additional medications.

C: Reduced spontaneous movements while walking: This could be indicative of Parkinsonism or negative symptoms of schizophrenia. However, it's not typically a reason to discontinue an antipsychotic.

E: Choreoathetoid movements of face: These are indicative of tardive dyskinesia, a serious side effect of antipsychotics. However, this condition usually develops after long-term use of antipsychotics (generally years), which makes it less likely in this patient who's been using fluphenazine for only 6 months. It's also not an acute and potentially life-threatening condition like acute dystonia.","stop","the correct answer is 'd': involuntary sustained twisting of neck.","D","E","USMLE question: A 30-year-old man presents to his psychiatrist for a follow-up visit.

The psychiatrist also notes that his delusions and other psychotic symptoms have improved significantly. However, the psychiatrist notices something while talking to the patient that prompts him to say, Ã¢â?¬Å?I know the drug has effectively controlled your symptoms but I think you should discontinue it now otherwise this side effect is likely to be irreversible.Ã¢â?¬Â Which of the following did the psychiatrist most likely notice in this patient?

1864,"The most likely diagnosis for this patient is 'C': Anorexia nervosa. 

Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by a distorted body image, with an unwarranted fear of being overweight. Symptoms include trying to maintain a below-normal weight through starvation or too much exercise. This patient's low body weight (BMI below the 5th percentile for age), self-induced weight loss, and distorted body image (believing she is overweight despite her underweight status) are characteristic of anorexia nervosa. In addition, her mother's history of major depressive disorder and her own social withdrawal increase her risk. Physical findings may vary widely and are a result of malnutrition and starvation; these can include hypothermia, bradycardia, hypotension, lanugo hair, salivary gland enlargement, and dry skin. The calluses on her knuckles may suggest that she has been inducing vomiting, which is not uncommon in anorexia nervosa.

Options 'A': Anemia, 'B': Milk-alkali syndrome, and 'E': Bulimia nervosa are less likely given the combination of her symptoms, clinical findings, and laboratory results. 

Option 'D': Major depressive disorder is also less likely due to the presence of specific eating disorder symptoms and physical signs indicative of self-induced vomiting and malnutrition. However, it is important to note that individuals with eating disorders often have comorbid psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder.

Her signs and symptoms such as weight loss, fatigue, staying in bed most of the time, lack of social interaction, appearance of being pale and thin, dry skin, brittle nails, and calluses on the knuckles all are consistent with anorexia nervosa. The calluses on the knuckles, also known as Russell's sign, are most commonly seen in bulimia nervosa but can also be seen in anorexia nervosa if the patient is purging. She also has a low potassium level, which can be caused by purging behavior. Furthermore, the mental health of family members can be a risk factor for eating disorders and her mother has major depressive disorder, which would further support this diagnosis.

In regards to the other options:

Option 'A': Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is within the normal range, so she doesn't have anemia. 

Option 'B': Milk-alkali syndrome: This condition is caused by consuming excessive amounts of calcium and absorbable alkali, which this patient has no history of. Also, her calcium level is slightly low, not high, as would be expected in milk-alkali syndrome.

Option 'D': Major depressive disorder: While the patient does show some signs of depression (fatigue, lack of social interaction, and family history of depression), the physical symptoms she presents (weight loss, dry skin, brittle nails, calluses on knuckles) are more indicative of an eating disorder.

Option 'E': Bulimia nervosa: While this patient does have some signs of bulimia nervosa (Russell's sign, low potassium level), her low BMI is not characteristic of this disorder. Most patients with bulimia nervosa are of normal weight or overweight. She also doesn't report episodes of binge eating, which is a criterion for bulimia nervosa."

The patient's presentation is suggestive of the chronic complications of Schistosoma haematobium infection. This is a trematode infection common in Africa, the Middle East, and India. It is associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder in chronic infections. The infection is acquired by exposure to freshwater contaminated with the parasite. The parasite's eggs can become lodged in the bladder wall, leading to chronic inflammation and squamous cell carcinoma. The eggs can also become lodged in the liver leading to granuloma formation and eventually calcified cysts in the liver.

1905,"The correct answer is 'C': Heparin.

Protamine sulfate is a drug that is used as an antidote for heparin, a blood thinner. Protamine works by binding to heparin to form a stable complex, thus neutralizing the anticoagulant effect. This is why heparin is the most likely anticoagulant administered to this patient.

Regarding the other options:

A: Warfarin is a Vitamin K antagonist and its effects are reversed with Vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma, not protamine.

B: Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). While protamine can partially reverse the effects of LMWHs, it does not completely neutralize their anticoagulant activity, which contrasts with the ""virtually completely reversed"" anticoagulant effect described in the question.

The other options are incorrect because protamine doesn't reverse their anticoagulant effects:
- Warfarin (Option A) is an oral anticoagulant that inhibits vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Its effects are reversed with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma, not protamine.
- Heparin (Option C) could also be reversed by protamine, however, it is less likely to be used in this patient due to his history of deep venous thrombosis. Heparin is typically administered for the treatment of acute thrombosis.

1913,"The correct answer is 'E': No additional pharmacotherapy at this time.

The 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on cholesterol management suggest that for patients 40 to 75 years old with a 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk of less than 5%, lifestyle modifications are the primary intervention, and statin therapy is generally not indicated (as is the case in this patient). Lifestyle modifications include a diet high in vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, and whole grains, and low in saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, sodium, and added sugars; regular exercise; weight maintenance; and avoidance of tobacco products.

The patient's LDL-C level is not optimal (<100 mg/dL is desirable), but the 10-year ASCVD risk is low, so additional pharmacotherapy is not indicated. 
   
Option 'A': Ezetimibe inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption and is used as an adjunct to diet when the LDL-C level is not controlled by diet and statin therapy alone. However, this patient's 10-year ASCVD risk does not warrant additional LDL-Câ??lowering therapy.
   
Option 'B': Fenofibrate is a fibric acid derivative used in the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia (>500 mg/dL), but this patient's triglyceride level is not elevated to that level.
   
Option 'C': Niacin decreases production of VLDLs (and therefore LDLs) in the liver and is used in patients with low HDL-C levels (<40 mg/dL in men; <50 mg/dL in women). However, niacin is not first-line therapy because of side effects (eg, flushing, hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia/gout) and lack of proven benefit in reducing ASCVD events.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient with dyslipidemia and hypertension has a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level above the generally desirable level (<100 mg/dL).

The 2018 cholesterol guidelines recommend moderate-intensity statin (such as her current treatment with atorvastatin) for patients aged 40-75 years with an LDL-C level of 70-189 mg/dL and a 10-year CVD risk of =7.5% (calculated by the ASCVD risk estimator, which incorporates age, sex, race, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking status, and diabetes status). However, if CVD risk is 5%-7.4%, a moderate-intensity statin can be considered with risk-enhancing factors such as chronic kidney disease, persistent LDL-C level > 160 mg/dL despite maximally tolerated statin therapy, metabolic syndrome, etc. Because this patient's 10-year CVD risk is <5% and there is no mention of risk-enhancing factors, the best next step is to continue her current therapy, ie, no additional pharmacotherapy at this time (Choice E). 

As for the other options, ezetimibe (Choice A) is the second-line agent for patients who do not achieve their LDL-C goals with statins, cannot tolerate statins, or have contraindications to statins. Fenofibrate (Choice B) is typically used for patients with significant hypertriglyceridemia, specifically when triglycerides are >500 mg/dL. Niacin (Choice C) can be used to reduce triglycerides and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but it is often poorly tolerated due to flushing and thus is generally avoided. As for fish oils (Choice D), a combination of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (omega-3 fatty acids) can be used to lower triglyceride levels but is generally reserved for patients with triglycerides >500 mg/dL."
1928,"The correct answer is E: Lactate dehydrogenase concentration.

This patient's presentation of pancytopenia (anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia), fatigue, dyspnea, pallor, and ecchymoses suggest aplastic anemia, a disease characterized by bone marrow failure and pancytopenia. In aplastic anemia, the bone marrow becomes hypocellular, with replacement of hematopoietic cells with fat. Etiologies include idiopathic (50% of cases), drugs (eg, chloramphenicol, alkylating agents, antimetabolites), radiation/chemical exposure, viral infection (eg, hepatitis, HIV, Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus B19), and immune diseases. Findings include normocytic, normochromic anemia; neutropenia; and thrombocytopenia. Increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) occurs because of increased turnover of hematopoietic cells.

Option A: Haptoglobin concentration is incorrect. Haptoglobin binds free hemoglobin, and its levels would be decreased in hemolytic anemias, not aplastic anemia.

Option B: Transferrin concentration is incorrect. Transferrin is a protein that carries iron in the blood. Its levels can increase in iron deficiency anemia and decrease in situations with excess iron (like hemochromatosis) or inflammation. It would not be particularly affected in aplastic anemia.

Option C: Reticulocyte count is incorrect. Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells. The reticulocyte count would be decreased in aplastic anemia because the bone marrow is not producing new red blood cells.

Option D: Erythropoietin concentration is incorrect. Erythropoietin stimulates the production of red blood cells, so its levels would increase in response to anemia. However, in aplastic anemia, the bone marrow cannot respond to erythropoietin due to damage or absence of precursor cells.

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a cytosolic enzyme that is present in nearly all cells of the body and is released upon cell destruction. Erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets are rich sources of LDH. Hence, in aplastic anemia, LDH levels are often high due to the high degree of destruction of circulating erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets. Therefore, option E, 'Lactate dehydrogenase concentration', is the correct answer.

Option A, 'Haptoglobin concentration', is incorrect because haptoglobin is a plasma protein that binds free hemoglobin released from erythrocytes. It is often decreased, not increased, in hemolytic anemias, not aplastic anemia.

Option B, 'Transferrin concentration', is incorrect because transferrin is a plasma protein that transports iron in the blood. It is usually increased in iron deficiency anemia and decreased in anemia of chronic disease, not aplastic anemia.

Option C, 'Reticulocyte count', is incorrect because reticulocytes are immature red blood cells. The reticulocyte count is usually increased in conditions where there is increased red cell production, like in hemolytic anemia or blood loss. In aplastic anemia, there is bone marrow failure, so reticulocyte count is typically low, not high.

Option D, 'Erythropoietin concentration', is incorrect because erythropoietin is a hormone that regulates red blood cell production. It is usually increased in anemias due to hypoxia (like in chronic kidney disease) or decreased in anemias due to decreased erythropoiesis (like in aplastic anemia).

NPH is a condition characterized by the triad of gait abnormalities, cognitive impairment, and urinary incontinence. Imaging in NPH typically shows ventriculomegaly with a disproportionately enlarged callosal angle (>40 degrees).

NPH is caused by decreased absorption of cerebrospinal fluid, which leads to dilation of the ventricles and stretching of the cortical fibers. This can cause the classic triad of gait disturbance, urinary incontinence and dementia (""wet, wobbly, wacky""). The gait disturbance is typically the first symptom and is characterized by a broad-based, magnetic, shuffling gait with reduced step height and stride length.

1947,"The most immediate effect of fluid resuscitation in this patient would be 'B: Increase in volume of distribution'. 

Explanation: The initial treatment for acute pancreatitis includes aggressive fluid resuscitation, which serves to replenish intravascular volume and support adequate tissue perfusion. The volume of distribution describes the distribution of a drug between plasma and the rest of the body and is dependent on factors like plasma protein binding and tissue sequestration. In this case, normal saline is the 'drug', and the volume of distribution increases because the fluid is being distributed throughout the body, particularly in the intravascular space. 

As for the other options: 

'A: Increase in cardiac afterload' is not immediately expected with fluid resuscitation. Afterload generally refers to the tension or stress developed in the wall of the left ventricle during ejection of blood, i.e., systole. While excessive fluid resuscitation can eventually lead to an increase in cardiac afterload, it is not an immediate effect.

'C: Increase in myocardial oxygen demand' could happen, but it is not the most immediate effect of fluid resuscitation. Myocardial oxygen demand would increase with an increased heart rate or contractility, which might occur if the fluid resuscitation was excessive and led to volume overload, but this is not the primary goal of fluid resuscitation.

'D: Increase in plasma oncotic pressure' might eventually occur with fluid resuscitation, especially if proteins (e.g., albumin) were administered, but normal saline does not contain proteins and thus would not immediately increase oncotic pressure.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The most likely immediate effect of fluid resuscitation in this patient would be 'B: Increase in volume of distribution'. 

In the early stages of resuscitation, administration of fluids (like normal saline) increases the volume of fluid in the intravascular space, effectively increasing the volume of distribution. This subsequently improves tissue perfusion and end-organ function, as it would in this patient with acute pancreatitis.

As for the other options:

A: 'Increase in cardiac afterload' - Fluid resuscitation typically doesn't affect afterload (the resistance the heart must overcome to eject blood) directly. However, over-aggressive fluid administration could theoretically increase afterload by increasing intravascular volume excessively, but this is not the immediate effect.

C: 'Increase in myocardial oxygen demand' - While fluid resuscitation can increase preload and thus cardiac output and myocardial oxygen demand, in the setting of acute pancreatitis and resuscitation, the main goal is to restore intravascular volume and improve perfusion. This should not drastically increase myocardial oxygen demand unless there's an underlying cardiac condition.

D: 'Increase in plasma oncotic pressure' - Normal saline, a crystalloid solution, doesn't significantly contribute to oncotic pressure as it doesn't contain proteins or large molecules that exert this pressure. It will mainly increase hydrostatic pressure and volume of distribution.

E: 'Increase in glomerular filtration fraction' - While fluid resuscitation can increase renal blood flow, it does not necessarily increase the glomerular filtration fraction (GFR/Renal plasma flow). GFR might increase with improved perfusion, but change in filtration fraction isn't the most immediate or direct effect of fluid resuscitation."

Therefore, the correct answer is A. Anterior pituitary gland.

Option B, Liver, is incorrect because although the liver does produce IGF-1 under the influence of GH, the primary pathology in acromegaly is related to the excessive production of GH by the pituitary gland.

Option C, Posterior pituitary gland, is incorrect because the posterior pituitary gland secretes oxytocin and vasopressin, neither of which are related to the symptoms of acromegaly.

Option D, Pancreas, is incorrect because although the pancreas does produce hormones, including insulin and glucagon, these are not related to the symptoms of acromegaly.

The absolute contraindication for organ donation in this patient is his HIV infection. There has been substantial progress in antiretroviral therapy, which has considerably improved the life expectancy of HIV-infected individuals. However, HIV infection remains an absolute contraindication for organ donation due to the risk of transmitting the virus to the organ recipient.

Option B: Childhood leukemia is not an absolute contraindication for organ donation. A history of cancer is not necessarily a contraindication to organ donation. It depends on the type of cancer, its stage, and duration of remission. In this case, the leukemia was diagnosed and treated 50 years ago, suggesting a long term remission which would not preclude organ donation.

Option C: Acute kidney injury is not an absolute contraindication for organ donation. Even with chronic kidney disease or acute kidney injury, other organs (not the kidneys) may still be suitable for transplantation.

Option D: Alcoholism is not an absolute contraindication for organ donation. Alcohol abuse can lead to chronic diseases, mainly of the liver, but doesn't necessarily affect the health of other organs. Again, the suitability of a particular organ for transplantation would depend on its condition.

Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker that primarily acts on the heart and blood vessels. It works by relaxing the blood vessels so the heart does not have to pump as hard, decreasing the heart's workload. Additionally, it increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart. 

This drug decreases the end-diastolic volume (EDV) by reducing preload, as it dilates the arteries and decreases the total peripheral resistance, reducing the amount of blood returning to the heart after each beat. 

Verapamil also decreases blood pressure (BP) due to its arterial dilation effect, reducing afterload on the heart.

Contractility is not significantly changed by verapamil because it primarily affects the vascular smooth muscles and the conduction system of the heart, but not the contractile elements of the cardiac myocytes themselves.

Finally, it can cause reflex tachycardia as a result of its blood pressure-lowering effects. When blood pressure decreases, the body compensates by increasing the heart rate to maintain cardiac output.

Option A is incorrect as verapamil does not increase heart rate directly, but does so indirectly through a reflex mechanism as explained above.
Option B is incorrect as verapamil clearly has effects on end-diastolic volume, blood pressure, and potentially on heart rate.
Option C is incorrect as verapamil can potentially increase heart rate through a reflex mechanism.

It does so through its vasodilatory and negative chronotropic activity. Therefore, the correct answer is 'D': ? ? no change ?.

Here is the breakdown by each individual parameter:

1) End-diastolic volume (EDV): Verapamil causes vasodilation which reduces the systemic vascular resistance (afterload). This leads to a decrease in ventricular end-diastolic volume (?).

2) Blood pressure (BP): Verapamil causes vasodilation which decreases both systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure (?).

3) Contractility: Verapamil is a non-dihydropyridine CCB, which means it works on the myocardium and the conduction system of the heart. It slows the influx of calcium into cardiac cells, which decreases contractility. However, the overall effect on contractility is generally minimal as the drug primarily reduces afterload and heart rate, which compensates for any decrease in contractility. Therefore, contractility is considered as 'no change'.

4) Heart Rate (HR): Verapamil mainly acts on heart rate by blocking calcium channels in the conduction system of the heart. As a result, it decreases the rate of phase 4 depolarization, slowing the heart rate (?).

A) Verapamil does not increase heart rate, it decreases it.
B) Verapamil does cause changes in each of the parameters listed, so this option is wrong.
C) Verapamil does not generally change contractility, so this option is wrong.
E) Verapamil does not increase EDV or decrease heart rate, so this option is wrong."

The best vaccine that could have prevented the boy from acquiring this infection is the conjugate vaccine (Option D). The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) is given to children under 2 years of age and helps protect against S. pneumoniae. It is termed 'conjugate' because the polysaccharide antigens of S. pneumoniae are linked (conjugated) to a protein carrier, which enhances the immune response in infants and young children.

This patient's presentation of fever, cough, and a homogenous opacity on chest x-ray are suggestive of lobar pneumonia, most commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in this age group. S. pneumoniae is a Gram-positive bacteria that causes infections such as pneumonia, otitis media, sinusitis, and meningitisâ??especially in children. The most effective way to prevent pneumococcal infection is through the use of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), which is given as part of the routine pediatric vaccination schedule.

Conjugate vaccines (Option D) are made by combining a weak antigen with a strong antigen so that the immune system has a stronger response to the weak antigen. In the case of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, the weak antigen is the polysaccharide capsule of the S. pneumoniae bacterium. This is combined with a protein that is an effective antigen. This makes the body produce a strong immune response to the capsule, and thus to the S. pneumoniae bacterium.

Live attenuated vaccines (Option A) contain a version of the living microbe that has been weakened in the lab so it canâ??t cause disease. Because a live, attenuated vaccine is the closest thing to a natural infection, these vaccines are good teachers for the immune system. However, due to safety concerns, they cannot be used in immunocompromised individuals and are not used for S. pneumoniae.

Inactivated vaccines (Option B) are made from microorganisms (viruses or bacteria) that have been killed or inactivated with heat or chemicals. They stimulate the immune response but not as strongly or effectively as live vaccines or conjugate vaccines.

Subunit vaccines (Option C) include only the parts of the virus or bacteria that stimulate a strong immune response. Theyâ??re safer than other types of vaccines, because they canâ??t cause disease. However, they're not used for S. pneumoniae.

Toxoid vaccines (Option E) contain a toxin made by the germ. They help the body build immunity to the parts of the germ that cause a disease, rather than the germ itself. For instance, the vaccine for diphtheria and tetanus are toxoid vaccines."

The initial choice of antihypertensive medication is based on comorbid conditions, patient characteristics, and adverse effect profile. In a patient with uncomplicated hypertension, thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are considered first-line therapy.

The PTT is prolonged because factor VIII is part of the intrinsic clotting pathway. PT and platelet count are usually normal.

Option A: Protein C is a natural anticoagulant. Deficiency of Protein C would lead to a hypercoagulable state rather than a bleeding disorder.
Option B: Plasmin is the primary enzyme responsible for breaking down fibrin clots. Decreased levels could lead to thrombosis, not excessive bleeding.
Option C: Thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin in the coagulation cascade. Deficiency would also lead to prolonged PT, which is not the case here.

Physical examination shows marked tenderness and swelling of the right knee joint. There are multiple bruises on the lower extremities in various stages of healing.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The patient's prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and history of prolonged bleeding after tooth extraction suggest a coagulation factor deficiency. The most common of these is Hemophilia A, which results from decreased factor VIII activity. Hemophilia A is an X-linked disorder that primarily affects males. It usually presents in childhood with recurrent and excessive bleeding after minor trauma or surgery. Hemarthroses (bleeding into joints) are a characteristic feature and often occur after minor trauma, as in this patient. The normal platelet count and bleeding time rule out a platelet disorder, and the normal prothrombin time rules out a deficiency in the extrinsic (factor VII) and common (factors II, V, X) coagulation pathways. Therefore, the correct answer is von Willebrand factor (D), as its primary function is to carry and stabilize factor VIII. A deficiency in von Willebrand factor can lead to decreased factor VIII activity and hemophilia A.

The other options are wrong because:
A: Protein C is part of the natural anticoagulant system and its deficiency would cause a hypercoagulable state, not a bleeding disorder.
B: Plasmin is involved in fibrinolysis (breakdown of clots). Deficiency would also lead to a hypercoagulable state.
C: Thrombin (factor II) is part of the common pathway, and deficiency would cause prolongation of both PT and PTT, but this patient's PT is normal.
E: Factor VII is part of the extrinsic pathway. Deficiency would lead to prolonged PT, but this patient's PT is normal."
2015,"The answer is C. Urine Chloride.

This patient's presentation is suggestive of metabolic alkalosis, which is characterized by an increased blood pH (>7.45) and bicarbonate concentration (>28 mEq/L). Metabolic alkalosis can be classified as chloride-responsive (urine chloride <10 mEq/L) or chloride-resistant (urine chloride >20 mEq/L) based on urinary chloride concentration. 

Chloride-responsive alkalosis, also known as extracellular volume contraction alkalosis, is typically due to vomiting or nasogastric suctioning, both of which involve loss of gastric acid (HCl). This loss results in a net gain of bicarbonate, producing the metabolic alkalosis. The body responds to the extracellular fluid volume contraction by increasing renal sodium and chloride reabsorption, which lowers the urine chloride concentration. 

Chloride-resistant alkalosis is typically due to excess mineralocorticoid activity, which increases renal bicarbonate reabsorption and impairs renal chloride reabsorption, resulting in high urinary chloride concentration.

Regarding the other options:

A. Urine albumin to creatinine ratio: This is used to assess for proteinuria in patients with suspected kidney disease. However, there is no indication of kidney disease in this patient.

B. Serum osmolal gap: This is used to detect the presence of osmotically active substances in the blood (eg, toxic alcohols). Again, there is no suggestion of this in the patient's presentation.

D. Urine anion gap: This is used to differentiate the cause of a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. However, this patient has metabolic alkalosis, not acidosis.

2022,"The best next step in management is 'B': Lumbar puncture. 

This patient's sudden-onset (thunderclap), severe headache, and neck stiffness are highly suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Most cases of SAH are due to rupture of a saccular (berry) aneurysm and are associated with hypertension. The classic presentation is a sudden, severe headache, often described as the worst of the patient's life. Associated symptoms can include neck stiffness due to meningeal irritation from blood in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), nausea/vomiting, loss of consciousness, or focal neurologic deficits. Initial evaluation of suspected SAH is a noncontrast head CT, which is most sensitive within the first 6 hours of symptom onset. If the CT is nondiagnostic and the suspicion for SAH remains high (as in this patient), a lumbar puncture should be performed. Xanthochromia of the CSF, due to bilirubin from the breakdown of red blood cells, is diagnostic for SAH.

Option A and D (Mannitol and Dexamethasone) are used to reduce intracranial pressure in patients with cerebral edema, not typically in subarachnoid hemorrhage. 

Option C and E (Nitroprusside and Labetalol) are antihypertensive medications. While it's true the patient has hypertension, treating blood pressure is not the immediate concern in the context of a possible subarachnoid hemorrhage.

2024,"This patient's history of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and rheumatoid arthritis, together with the clinical findings of muscle pain and weakness, suggest a likely diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency. African American individuals are at higher risk for vitamin D deficiency due to increased skin melanin, which blocks UVB radiation and decreases the skin's production of vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism. This is because vitamin D is necessary for the absorption of dietary calcium in the gut. When levels of vitamin D are low, less calcium is absorbed in the gut, leading to low serum calcium levels. The parathyroid glands respond to this low calcium level by increasing PTH secretion, which in turn increases calcium resorption from bone and reabsorption in the kidneys to normalize serum calcium levels. However, the trade-off is that serum phosphate levels decrease as phosphate excretion is enhanced by PTH. Therefore, the serum analysis in this patient would likely show increased PTH, decreased phosphate, and normal calcium levels (choice C).

Decreased PTH, decreased phosphate, and increased calcium (choice A) is seen in familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, a condition characterized by lifelong hypercalcemia and relative hypocalciuria. Decreased PTH, increased phosphate, and decreased calcium (choice B) is seen in hypoparathyroidism.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's muscle weakness, fatigue, and constipation are likely due to hypercalcemia. She is at risk for developing hypercalcemia due to her history of rheumatoid arthritis, which is treated with methotrexate. Methotrexate can cause hypercalcemia by leading to increased vitamin D production in activated lymphocytes and macrophages. This in turn increases the absorption of calcium in the gut and reabsorption in the kidneys, leading to hypercalcemia. Because the calcium level is elevated, the parathyroid hormone (PTH) level will be decreased due to negative feedback. Phosphate is usually inversely proportional to calcium, so we expect phosphate to be decreased as well. Therefore, the correct answer would be 'A': Decreased PTH, decreased phosphate, and increased calcium.

Option 'B' is incorrect as we expect the calcium level to be increased, not decreased. Option 'C' is incorrect as we would expect PTH to be decreased, not increased, in response to increased calcium levels.

2027,"This patient's hyperglycemia (serum glucose: 945 mg/dL), hyperosmolality (serum osmolality: 338 mOsm/kg), and alteration in mental status (disoriented to place and time) are suggestive of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), a complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus often precipitated by physiologic stress (e.g., infection). HHS is characterized by severe hyperglycemia and hyperosmolality that lead to severe dehydration, neurological abnormalities (e.g., seizures, option C), and, if not rapidly corrected, coma and death.

This patient's excessive thirst, polyuria, mental status changes, and hyperglycemia (>600 mg/dL) are indicative of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS). HHS is a complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus that often develops over days to weeks. It is most commonly precipitated by physiologic stressors, such as severe illness, certain medications (e.g. glucocorticoids, thiazides, phenytoin), and inadequate insulin therapy. The clinical presentation includes profound dehydration due to osmotic diuresis, and neurologic abnormalities ranging from confusion to coma due to hyperosmolarity.

HHS can be differentiated from diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) by the absence of significant ketoacidosis, as demonstrated by a normal anion gap and bicarbonate level, and the absence of a fruity odor to the breath (option A) due to negative serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (which would be elevated in ketosis). Other findings in DKA, such as nausea or vomiting (option D) and abdominal pain (option B), which would be due to ketone-induced gastric irritation, are also absent in HHS.

Although both hyperglycemia and hyponatremia can cause seizures (option C), this is more common when these abnormalities develop rapidly or are extreme. However, HHS is a subacute or chronic process, and the patient's sodium level, while low, is not critically so. Seizures are less likely than the predictable manifestations of HHS, such as volume depletion (e.g. tachycardia, hypotension) and altered mental status.

Kussmaul respirations (rapid, deep breathing - option E) can be seen in both HHS and DKA, and serve as a compensatory response to metabolic acidemia. In DKA, it is a response to ketoacidosis, while in HHS, it is due to the respiratory system's attempt to compensate for the mild acidemia caused by lactic acidosis (from hypoperfusion) and hyperchloremic acidosis (from renal compensation for the hyperosmolar state)."

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to discharge the patient home and let her return to school after the rash resolves (Option D). 

Option A (Administer intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)) is not appropriate as the patient does not have a severe or life-threatening infection. IVIG is used in cases of severe or refractory infections, which is not the case here.

Option B (Transfuse with whole blood) is incorrect because the patient's laboratory findings do not suggest any hematologic abnormalities that would warrant a blood transfusion.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The most likely explanation for this patient's numbness surrounding his mouth and in his extremities is hypocalcemia, however, it is not included in the options. Hypocalcemia often presents with perioral numbness and paresthesia in the extremities. This patient has chronic pancreatitis due to alcohol abuse. Pancreatitis can lead to hypocalcemia due to fat saponification, where calcium binds to fatty acids and results in low serum levels. The patient's recent massive transfusion can exacerbate hypocalcemia as citrate, an anticoagulant in stored blood products, binds to calcium.

Now, let's evaluate the given options:

A) Hypokalemia: This condition can cause muscle weakness and arrhythmias, but it is less likely to cause perioral numbness and paresthesias, which are more typical of hypocalcemia.

B) Late-onset edema surrounding the spinal cord: This is unlikely as the numbness is both around his mouth and in his extremities. Spinal cord injury would typically cause symptoms below the level of the lesion, not around the mouth.

C) Medication complication: Certain medications can cause similar symptoms, especially those affecting the nervous system. However, the history of pancreatitis and blood transfusion make hypocalcemia a more likely explanation.

D) Transfusion complication: Massive transfusions can cause hypocalcemia as already explained, but the option is not specific enough. 

E) Trauma to the spinal cord: This patient has a pelvic fracture, but there is no indication of spinal cord injury. Even if there were, it would not explain perioral numbness.

A nicotine patch (choice A) would be helpful if the patient were ready to quit smoking, as smoking can worsen GERD by relaxing the lower esophageal sphincter. However, smoking cessation is unlikely to completely resolve her symptoms at this point, given her significant history and the failure of her current GERD regimen.

Barrett esophagus (specialized intestinal metaplasia of the distal esophagus) is a complication of long standing GERD and is a premalignant condition that can progress to esophageal adenocarcinoma. Risk factors for Barrett esophagus include age >50, male sex, white race, chronic GERD, hiatal hernia, increased body mass index, and tobacco use.

The patient's cognitive impairment, particularly affecting short-term memory, combined with atrophy of the medial temporal lobes and hippocampi on brain MRI, suggests a diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD). The most common late-onset form of AD (>65 years) appears to be multifactorial, involving both genetic and environmental risk factors. However, the ApoE gene is the most potent genetic risk factor identified so far. The ApoE gene has three common alleles (e2, e3, e4), of which the e4 allele greatly increases the risk of developing AD and lowers the age of onset.

2072,"The correct answer is B. 'Gram-positive, catalase-positive, coagulase-negative, novobiocin-resistant cocci in clusters'

This patient has Staphylococcus epidermidis infection, a common cause of endocarditis in patients with prosthetic devices such as heart valves and intravascular devices (eg, catheters, ports). S. epidermidis is a gram-positive, catalase-positive, coagulase-negative organism that forms white, nonhemolytic colonies on blood agar. It produces a biofilm that enables it to adhere to foreign bodies and protects it from host defenses and antibiotics. The biofilm is composed of polysaccharides, proteins, and DNA and facilitates attachment of the organism to the device, leading to colonization and persistent infection.

Option A: 'Gram-positive, catalase-negative, Î±-hemolytic, optochin-resistant cocci in chains' refers to Streptococcus viridans group. They cause subacute bacterial endocarditis typically in the setting of abnormal or damaged heart valves, but not typically in the setting of intravascular devices.

Option C: 'Gram-positive, catalase-positive, coagulase-positive cocci in clusters' refers to Staphylococcus aureus. While S. aureus can cause endocarditis, it typically does so in individuals who inject drugs rather than those with intravascular devices.

Option D: 'Gram-positive, catalase-negative, nonhemolytic, salt-sensitive cocci in chains' describes Enterococcus species. These organisms are a common cause of hospital-acquired infections, but they are not associated with endocarditis due to intravascular devices.

The findings of a diminished ventricular chamber volume, a sigmoid-shaped interventricular septum, and an enlarged left atrium are classic signs of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). In HCM, the myocardium, especially in the interventricular septum, is hypertrophied, leading to a decreased ventricular volume and a sigmoid-shaped septum. The left atrium is often enlarged due to impaired filling of the left ventricle. The brown perinuclear cytoplasmic granules in numerous myocardial cells (also known as ""boxcar nuclei"") are a sign of cellular aging and are often seen in patients with HCM.

Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease that is often asymptomatic until critical stenosis or plaque rupture leads to tissue ischemia or infarction. This patient's age, smoking history, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus are all risk factors for atherosclerosis. The internal carotid artery is a common site of atherosclerotic disease and may cause cerebral infarction due to reduced blood flow (thrombotic stroke) or embolization of atherosclerotic debris.

This patient's short stature, cystic hygroma at birth, and lower-extremity muscle cramping (possible claudication from decreased blood flow) suggest Turner syndrome (45,XO), a disorder characterized by partial or complete absence of one sex chromosome. Turner syndrome affects only females and is associated with a webbed neck, broad chest with widely spaced nipples, short stature, low posterior hairline, lymphedema (which can cause cystic hygroma), coarctation of the aorta, and an increased risk of bicuspid aortic valve and aortic dissection. Decreased blood flow distal to the coarctation can cause lower-extremity claudication and differential blood pressure measurements between the upper and lower extremities (option A). However, the most distinguishing finding is absence of Barr bodies on buccal smear, which indicates only one X chromosome (45,XO).

The symptoms exhibited by the patient including the intermittent pain and swelling of the joints, morning stiffness which improves with activity (""gelling""), and the anterior uveitis (iritis) seen on slit lamp examination all suggest a diagnosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). JIA is a group of disorders characterized by chronic arthritis with onset before 16 years of age and no other identifiable cause. Oligoarticular JIA, the most common form, involves â?¤4 joints during the first 6 months of disease. Patients often present with pain, stiffness, swelling, loss of function, and in some cases, low-grade fever. ANA positivity is seen in approximately 80% of patients with oligoarticular JIA and is associated with a higher risk of uveitis. 

Options A, B, D, and E are likely incorrect for the following reasons:

Lab findings would show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and/or leukocytosis with blasts. 

B. Enthesitis-related arthritis: It is a subtype of JIA that typically affects boys over 6 years old. It is characterized by inflammation of entheses (places where tendons or ligaments insert into the bone) and the axial skeleton (sacroiliac joints and spine). 

D. Postinfectious arthritis: It usually occurs after a bacterial or viral infection and involves one or few joints. This patient's arthritis has been ongoing for months, which is not typical of a postinfectious process.

Dilated cardiomyopathy is often preceded by a viral prodrome and is characterized by increased ventricular size and impaired systolic function. This results in biventricular heart failure manifested by symptoms such as dyspnea on exertion (due to reduced cardiac output and pulmonary congestion) and lower limb edema (due to systemic venous congestion). Physical examination can reveal signs of volume overload, such as jugular venous distention, S3 gallop due to increased flow across the mitral valve, and laterally displaced PMI due to left ventricular enlargement.

Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (option B) occurs in pressure overload conditions such as aortic stenosis and hypertension. It results in a hypertrophy pattern on EKG and often asymmetrical septal hypertrophy on echocardiography.

Fibrofatty replacement of the myocardium (option C) is seen in Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC), which presents with ventricular arrhythmia, sudden cardiac death, and sometimes right-sided heart failure.

In this scenario, the 40 people from different households are the initial cases. The total number of people in these households is 150. So, 150 is the total number of people at risk of secondary attack. 

The question states that 90 new cases of the disease are reported from these same households ten days later. These 90 new cases represent the secondary cases. 

Therefore, the secondary attack rate would be the number of secondary cases (90) divided by the total number of people at risk of secondary attack (150), and then multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. Hence, the calculation would be (90/150) x 100, which is answer choice D.

It's calculated by dividing the number of new cases that have developed among the contacts of known cases (secondary cases), by the number of individuals who were initially susceptible.

In this question, the 40 people who first developed the infection are the primary cases, and the people in their households are the susceptible contacts. The â??secondaryâ? cases are those who developed the disease after being in contact with the primary cases, within a time period that could be attributed to the incubation period of the disease. 

Ten days after the initial 40 cases, 90 more people in these households developed the disease. These are the secondary cases, because they developed the disease after being in contact with the primary cases. The 25 cases that occurred a month later are too far removed from the initial outbreak to be considered secondary cases, since the incubation period of the disease is only 7 days.

This syndrome often presents with characteristic skeletal features such as tall stature and long extremities.

As for the gynecomastia, it is often seen in cases of Klinefelter syndrome, a condition that also leads to male infertility due to the presence of an extra X chromosome (47, XXY). Patients with Klinefelter syndrome have testicular atrophy leading to decreased production of testosterone and increased production of gonadotropins, including luteinizing hormone (LH) - not decreased LH (option A). 

Elevated aromatase levels (option C) would lead to increased conversion of testosterone to estradiol, which could explain the gynecomastia but not the infertility as men with increased aromatase levels do not necessarily have reduced fertility.

Elevated homocysteine levels (option D) would point towards conditions like homocystinuria, which this patient does not seem to have.

2217,"The question is describing the histological appearance of the pancreas, where cells are arranged in acini (spherical clusters) with ducts in between. The ""pale cells with a rich blood supply"" likely represent the Islets of Langerhans, which are less basophilic (less blue) than the surrounding exocrine acinar cells and have a rich blood supply. These islets contain different types of cells that secrete various hormones, including insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide.

Option D: 'There are several different types of cells within the patch that cannot be differentiated by light microscopy.'

Explanation of incorrect options:

Option A: 'These cells should be separated from the basophils by a dense capsule.' â?? This statement is incorrect because the Islets of Langerhans are not separated from the rest of the pancreas by a dense capsule.

Option C: 'Some of these cells undergo transformation and begin to secrete insulin to compensate for the loss of pancreatic beta cells.' â?? This is incorrect because the islet cells do not undergo transformation to secrete insulin in response to loss of beta cells. Beta cell loss (such as in Type 1 diabetes) leads to decreased insulin production.

2227,"This patient's diarrhea, flushing, and history of asthma are suggestive of carcinoid syndrome, a disorder typically due to a metastatic carcinoid tumor that secretes high levels of serotonin and other vasoactive substances. Carcinoid tumors are usually located in the small intestine but can arise from any tissue that contains neuroendocrine cells, including the lungs.

Serotonin overproduction can lead to chronic diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and cutaneous flushing (due to vasodilation). Asthma-like symptoms (eg, wheezing, dyspnea) can occur due to bronchospasm.

Without treatment, carcinoid syndrome can lead to carcinoid heart disease, characterized by right-sided valvular fibrosis leading to tricuspid regurgitation and/or pulmonic stenosis. This can be heard as a murmur along the left sternal border. Other symptoms of carcinoid heart disease include right-sided heart failure, with peripheral edema and ascites.

So, given this patient's symptoms and potential complications, he is at greatest risk for Asphyxia (Option A) due to the potential for carcinoid-induced bronchospasm.

Carcinoid syndrome is a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with a serotonin-secreting neuroendocrine tumor (most often located in the small intestine). The syndrome typically manifests only after the tumor has metastasized to the liver. This is because serotonin is metabolized by monoamine oxidase in the liver and lung, preventing systemic effects when the tumor is confined to the gastrointestinal tract.

Patients with carcinoid syndrome are at risk for the development of carcinoid heart disease, which is characterized by plaque-like deposits of fibrous tissue on the endocardium, leading to varying degrees of right-sided valvular heart disease (eg, tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary stenosis). Therefore, the patient is at greatest risk for Option A (Asphyxia) secondary to right-sided heart failure caused by carcinoid heart disease. Left-sided valvular lesions are far less common because serotonin is largely inactivated in the lungs after passing through the right heart.

2235,"The most appropriate next step in management for this patient is 'E: Colposcopy with endometrial sampling'.

A high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) on a Pap smear indicates a precancerous change in the cells on the surface of the cervix. This condition requires further evaluation with colposcopy and biopsy to assess the extent of the disease and to rule out invasive cancer. 

Option 'A: Repeat cytology in 3 months' is not the best choice because HSIL is a high-risk condition and warrants immediate further investigation. Waiting for 3 months before repeating the cytology might delay necessary treatment.

Option 'B: Laser ablative therapy' is not correct because this method is generally used for treating cervical intraepithelial neoplasia after it has been confirmed by biopsy. It is not used as the first step after identifying HSIL on a pap smear.

HSIL corresponds to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or 3 (CIN2, CIN3) and conveys a significant risk for progression to invasive cervical carcinoma. Patients with HSIL cytology should be referred for colposcopy with endocervical sampling because the transformation zone (the origin for most cervical neoplasia) may not be visible in its entirety. Biopsies should be obtained from all visible lesions in the cervix. If no lesions are visible, at least 1 biopsy should be taken from each quadrant of the transformation zone.

This patient's mental status changes, severe hyperglycemia (>600 mg/dL), increased anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA), and positive urinary ketones are suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The most common precipitants of DKA are infections and inadequate insulin therapy. This patient's urinary tract infection and possible poor oral intake and adherence to insulin therapy due to studying and prayer group meetings likely contributed to her condition. 

Option A is incorrect because although hyponatremia can be associated with a poor prognosis in some situations, this patient's hyponatremia is likely ""pseudo"" or artifactually low due to severe hyperglycemia, which causes water to move from the intracellular to the extracellular space, diluting the sodium. 

Option B is incorrect because hyperkalemia in DKA is usually not due to increased total body potassium. Instead, it's caused by acidemia and insulin deficiency, both of which cause potassium to shift from the intracellular to the extracellular space. In fact, total body potassium is usually depleted in DKA due to osmotic diuresis.

Option D is incorrect because azotemia (elevated BUN and creatinine) in this case is likely prerenal due to volume contraction from osmotic diuresis and does not contribute independently to her encephalopathy. 

Option E is incorrect because hypochloremia does not support the diagnosis of a pure anion gap metabolic acidosis.

Common precipitants include infection, insulin cessation, or another form of severe physiological stress. Symptoms include polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, fatigue, abdominal pain, and changes in mental status. Hyperglycemia leads to osmotic diuresis, dehydration, and loss of electrolytes. Kussmaul respirations (deep, rapid breathing) may be present due to respiratory compensation. Elevated ketone production (Ã?-hydroxybutyrate > acetoacetate) leads to an elevated anion gap.

So, the correct answer is C: 'Hyperglycemia to this magnitude supports hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome'. Despite the name, this condition and DKA represent a spectrum, rather than discrete entities. Absolute or relative insulin deficiency leads to increased gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and ketogenesis and decreased glucose uptake in peripheral tissues, which leads to hyperglycemia and ketosis. These processes are the same between the conditions, but the degree of each varies. 

Now let's discuss why the other options are incorrect:

Option 'A': Hyponatremia in DKA is usually due to a dilutional effect from hyperglycemia, and proper management of the underlying DKA usually corrects the hyponatremia. There is no direct association of hyponatremia with a poor prognosis in DKA.

Option 'B': In DKA, hyperkalemia is typically due to metabolic acidosis and insulin deficiency (as insulin drives potassium into cells). However, total body potassium is typically low due to losses from osmotic diuresis, despite what the serum potassium level might suggest.

Option 'D': Azotemia (elevated BUN and creatinine) in DKA is typically pre-renal and due to volume depletion from osmotic diuresis, not due to intrinsic kidney disease. The mental status changes in DKA are not due to azotemia, but to the hyperosmolar state induced by hyperglycemia.

Option 'E': The chloride level in this patient is actually normal, not low, so it doesn't support an anion-gap metabolic acidosis. The low bicarbonate level, however, does support such a diagnosis, and is typical in DKA."

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's new-onset sexual dysfunction, minor headaches, and sleep disturbance suggest an elevated prolactin level (Choice B). Prolactin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), resulting in decreased luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone and leading to hypogonadism. This can manifest as sexual dysfunction in males. Additionally, hyperprolactinemia can cause headaches and sleep disturbances. 

The most common cause of hyperprolactinemia is a prolactinoma, but medications, particularly antipsychotics and antidepressants like trazodone, can also increase prolactin levels. However, the patient's headaches preceded the use of trazodone, making medication-induced hyperprolactinemia (Choice C) less likely. 

Atherosclerotic change (Choice A) is a common cause of sexual dysfunction in males, particularly those with risk factors like diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and smoking. However, this would not explain the new headaches or sleep disturbance.

The patient's symptoms are classic for appendicitis, which typically starts with visceral, poorly localized, periumbilical pain. This is due to the midgut origin of the appendix, which is innervated by visceral afferent fibers that enter the spinal cord at approximately the T10-L1 level. Hence, the initial diffuse pain is due to the distention of the appendix stimulating these visceral afferents.

The pain then localizes to the right lower quadrant as the inflammation irritates the parietal peritoneum of the abdominal wall, which is innervated by somatic afferent fibers that follow a more dermatomal pattern. This is why the pain becomes more localized and sharp.

The other options are wrong because they do not correspond to the correct spinal nerve roots that are associated with the innervation of the midgut and abdominal wall. C6, T4, and T7 are all too high and would correspond more to thoracic or upper abdominal structures.

Option 'A': Arterial blood leakage, or hemorrhage, would generally cause a hyperdensity on CT scan due to the relatively high density of blood.

Option 'B': Arterial dissection in the brain could potentially cause a stroke, but it would be much less likely to selectively affect the cerebellum, and the CT findings might be more complex than a simple hypodensity.

Option 'D': Carotid stenosis can cause cerebral infarctions due to decreased blood flow, but it typically affects the areas of the brain supplied by the carotid artery, which does not include the cerebellum.

Option 'E': Lacunar infarctions are small infarcts that typically occur in the deep structures of the brain (such as the basal ganglia, pons, and internal capsule) due to occlusion of small penetrating arteries. They do not typically involve the cerebellum."
2265,"This patient's presentation of acute onset, severe eye pain, and rapidly progressive vision loss, with a fixed and dilated pupil and corneal clouding on examination, suggests acute angle-closure glaucoma (AACG). AACG is a true ophthalmologic emergency that occurs due to obstruction of the trabecular meshwork by the peripheral iris, leading to a rapid and painful rise in intraocular pressure (IOP). This can cause permanent vision loss within hours if not promptly treated. While factors such as pupillary dilation and systemic anticholinergic medications can precipitate AACG, beta-agonists (like the rescue inhaler this patient used) can cause an increase in aqueous humor production, leading to an acute increase in IOP. Initial management of AACG includes decreasing IOP with medications like beta-blockers (eg, timolol), alpha agonists (eg, apraclonidine), carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (eg, acetazolamide), and hyperosmotic agents (eg, mannitol). Pilocarpine, a muscarinic agonist, is also often used to induce miosis, which can help open the angle and improve outflow. However, in patients with AACG, definitive management involves relieving the relative pupillary block with laser peripheral iridotomy. This procedure creates an opening in the peripheral iris, allowing aqueous humor to flow from the posterior to the anterior chamber, thereby breaking the attack and preventing future episodes. Therefore, option E (Perform emergency iridotomy) is the correct answer.

Option A (Administer systemic steroids) is incorrect as steroids are not used in the initial management of AACG because they have no effect on the acute IOP elevation.

Option B (Get an urgent ophthalmology consultation) is incorrect as this is not the immediate next step. The patient needs definitive treatment, which is laser peripheral iridotomy.

Option C (Anesthetize the eye and perform corneal indentation) is incorrect as corneal indentation (or corneal indentation gonioscopy) is not usually the definitive treatment for AACG.

Option D (Add latanoprost) is incorrect because prostaglandin analogues like latanoprost are not usually used during an acute attack of AACG because they may exacerbate inflammation and are less effective in rapidly decreasing IOP compared to other classes of medications.","stop","therefore, option e (perform emergency iridotomy) is the correct answer.","E","B","USMLE question: A 50-year-old man presents with a rapid onset of severe, right periorbital pain, an ipsilateral throbbing headache, and blurred vision for the past hour. The patient says he was out walking with his friend when he felt short of breath. His friend gave him a puff of his rescue inhaler because it often relives his breathlessness, but, soon after that, the patient's eye symptoms started. No significant past medical history. His pulse is 100/min and regular, respirations are 18/min, temperature is 36.7Ã?Â°C (98.0Ã?Â°F), and blood pressure 130/86 mm Hg. On physical examination, his right pupil is fixed and dilated. Fundoscopic examination of the right eye is difficult due to 'clouding' of the cornea, and tonometry reveals increased intraocular pressure (IOP). Ibuprofen, acetazolamide, timolol, pilocarpine, and topical prednisolone are administered, but the patient's symptoms are only slightly reduced. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?
Option: {'A': 'Administer systemic steroids.', 'B': 'Get an urgent ophthalmology consultation.', 'C': 'Anesthetize the eye and perform corneal indentation.', 'D': 'Add latanoprost.', 'E': 'Perform emergency iridotomy.'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's acute onset of severe eye pain, nausea, and blurred vision with a fixed, dilated pupil and increased intraocular pressure after using his friend's inhaler suggests acute angle-closure glaucoma (AACG). AACG occurs when the flow of aqueous humor is suddenly blocked, leading to increased intraocular pressure. Mydriatic agents (eg, alpha adrenergics, anticholinergics) and sympathomimetics (eg, albuterol - likely the active ingredient in the inhaler) can precipitate AACG by causing further dilation of the pupil and preventing aqueous humor drainage through the trabecular meshwork. Initial treatment involves reducing the production and promoting the outflow of aqueous humor using topical beta-blockers (eg, timolol), alpha agonists, and systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (eg, acetazolamide). Topical steroids (eg, prednisolone) can help prevent inflammation and scarring of the trabecular meshwork after an acute attack. Miotic agents (eg, pilocarpine) are used to constrict the pupil and pull the iris away from the trabecular meshwork, also promoting outflow.
If initial medical therapy fails to rapidly reduce intraocular pressure and relieve symptoms, emergent ophthalmology consultation is necessary for definitive treatment with laser peripheral iridotomy (Option B). This procedure creates a new channel for aqueous flow from the posterior to the anterior chamber, bypassing the pupil. It can provide rapid relief and is definitive treatment for AACG. 

Options A, C, and D may not achieve the rapid reduction in intraocular pressure necessary in AACG, and could delay definitive therapy. Option E refers to an emergency iridotomy, which would be performed by an ophthalmologist, so the correct answer is to get an urgent ophthalmology consultation."

This pregnant woman with fever, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, and mild pyuria likely has acute pyelonephritis, which can often present atypically in pregnant women, with the pain shifted upward in the abdomen due to displacement of the kidney by the growing uterus. Right upper quadrant pain can be seen with hepatic, gallbladder, or renal pathology. However, hepatic and gallbladder pathology (eg, cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis) would not cause pyuria. Pyuria (ie, >10 white blood cells/high-power field) is suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI).

Option A, HELLP syndrome (ie, Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets), is less likely as it is usually seen in the third trimester of pregnancy and is associated with severe preeclampsia. There is no evidence of hypertension or proteinuria, which are usually seen in preeclampsia, in this case.

Option B, Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), typically presents with colicky pain, hematuria, and unilateral flank tenderness, which this patient does not have.

RUQ tenderness on examination is a common finding.

HELLP syndrome (Option A) is a severe form of preeclampsia characterized by Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelet count. The main symptoms are hypertension and proteinuria, which are not described in this patient.

Nephrolithiasis (Option B) often presents with flank pain that may radiate to the groin, with or without microscopic hematuria. Although the patient has some urinary findings, the predominance of abdominal pain makes this diagnosis less likely.

Appendicitis (Option D) typically presents with periumbilical pain that migrates to the right lower quadrant, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and anorexia.

Pyelonephritis (Option E) typically presents with flank pain, fever, and irritative urinary symptoms, such as dysuria, frequency, and urgency. The presence of pyuria (white blood cells in the urine) is suggestive, but the dominant symptom of upper abdominal pain is not typical of pyelonephritis."
2279,"The correct answer is C: 'The patient may have a history of mania.'

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with a bipolar disorder, specifically Bipolar I disorder, which is characterized by at least one episode of mania. Mania is defined as a period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy lasting at least one week and present most of the day, nearly every day. The elevated mood is often accompanied by increased talkativeness or pressure to keep talking, flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing, and distractibility. 

Option A is incorrect because her diagnosis of unipolar depression is not necessarily incorrect; it's just incomplete. It's possible that she was initially misdiagnosed because she had not yet experienced a manic episode.

Option B is incorrect because the duration criterion for a manic episode is at least one week, not specifically 7 days.

Option D is incorrect because even though patients with bipolar disorder can have psychotic features during manic or depressive episodes, the question stem does not provide any information to support that this patient has psychotic features.

Option E is incorrect because antidepressants are not necessarily inappropriate for treating bipolar disorder.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is C: 'The patient may have a history of mania.'

This woman's clinical presentation is consistent with bipolar disorder, which is characterized by episodes of mania and depression. At the initial visit, she had symptoms of major depressive disorder (eg, depressed mood, anhedonia, feelings of guilt/worthlessness, decreased energy, decreased concentration, insomnia, weight loss). Now, she has symptoms of a manic episode (eg, increased energy, excessive talkativeness, flight of ideas, distractibility). Although the medication (antidepressant) given earlier might have contributed to the onset of mania, it's also possible that she had a history of undiagnosed manic episodes, hence the answer C.

Option A is incorrect because the diagnosis of unipolar depression wasn't necessarily incorrect at the time. She presented with symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder, and it's common for bipolar disorder to initially present as a depressive episode.

Option B is incorrect because, although in general, manic or hypomanic symptoms need to last at least a week (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary) for the diagnosis of a manic or hypomanic episode, this patient's dramatic change in behavior is concerning for mania, even if it hasn't lasted for 7 days.

Option D is incorrect because the presence of manic symptoms doesn't necessarily indicate the presence of psychosis. Psychotic features can occur in severe manic episodes, but there is no information given that would suggest this patient is experiencing hallucinations or delusions.

Option E is incorrect because antidepressants are not inappropriate for bipolar disorder. However, they should be used in conjunction with a mood stabilizer or atypical antipsychotic to prevent the onset of a manic episode. It's possible that this patient's manic episode was triggered by the antidepressant she was prescribed, but that doesn't mean antidepressants are inappropriate altogether. They just need to be used carefully in patients with bipolar disorder."
2284,"The best answer is E: 'Weakened live microorganisms'. 

Live attenuated vaccines (weakened live microorganisms) are the most immunogenic vaccines because they can replicate and stimulate a response that is almost identical to the natural infection. They also stimulate both the humoral (antibody-mediated) and cellular (T-cell mediated) immunity, and often confer lifelong immunity with just one or two doses. Examples include the vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella.

Option A: 'Foreign intact polysaccharide bound to protein' refers to conjugate vaccines. These vaccines are used to improve the immune response to polysaccharides, which are generally poor immunogens especially in children. Conjugate vaccines are less immunogenic than live attenuated vaccines.

Option B: 'Chemically inactivated microorganism' refers to inactivated or killed vaccines. These vaccines are less immunogenic than live vaccines because they cannot replicate and usually require multiple doses and booster shots to maintain immunity. 

Option C: 'Foreign intact polysaccharide' refers to polysaccharide vaccines. These vaccines are less immunogenic, especially in children, and often require booster shots. 

Option D: 'Foreign denaturated protein' refers to subunit or recombinant vaccines which use a piece of the pathogen to stimulate an immune response. These are generally less immunogenic than live vaccines and often require adjuvants to boost the immune response.","stop","the best answer is e: 'weakened live microorganisms'.","E","E","USMLE question: An investigator is developing a new vaccine. After injecting the agent, the immune response is recorded by measuring vaccine-specific antibodies at subsequent timed intervals.

Option: {'A': 'Foreign intact polysaccharide bound to protein', 'B': 'Chemically inactivated microorganism', 'C': 'Foreign intact polysaccharide', 'D': 'Foreign denaturated protein', 'E': 'Weakened live microorganisms'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The answer is A: Foreign intact polysaccharide bound to protein.

Vaccines work by exposing the body's immune system to a harmless version of the pathogen, so it can develop a response and ""remember"" the pathogen if it encounters it again in the future. Typically, the more similar the vaccine is to the actual pathogen, the stronger the immune response will be.

Option A, foreign intact polysaccharide bound to protein, would likely induce a strong immunogenic response because it closely mimics the structure of many bacteria. Polysaccharides are complex carbohydrates found on the surface of many bacteria, and they are typically the part of the bacteria that our immune system recognizes and responds to. By binding the polysaccharide to a protein, the immune system is further stimulated, producing a stronger immune response.

Option B, chemically inactivated microorganism, can also be used in a vaccine. However, the inactivation process can potentially alter the structure of the microorganism, making it less recognizable to the immune system and therefore less immunogenic.

Option C, foreign intact polysaccharide, would also induce an immune response. However, without the protein binding, the response may not be as strong as with option A. 

Option D, foreign denatured protein, would be less immunogenic because denaturation changes the structure of the protein. The immune system may not recognize it as effectively, leading to a weaker response.

Option E, weakened live microorganisms, can sometimes be used in vaccines and can induce a strong immune response. However, there is a risk that the weakened microorganism could still cause disease, particularly in people with weakened immune systems. 

Therefore, option A, foreign intact polysaccharide bound to protein, would most likely induce the maximum immunogenic response."
2286,"The patient is exhibiting disease state E: Convalescent (window) period.

In HBV infection, the first serologic marker to appear is the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). If the infection progresses to chronicity, this antigen may remain detectable in the serum indefinitely. The presence of HBsAg indicates that the patient is infectious. In an acute infection (Option A), both HBsAg and HBcAb (hepatitis B core antibody) would be positive. 

In this patient, HBsAg is negative, but HBV DNA (indicating viral replication) and HBcAb (indicating a past or current infection) are positive. This profile is characteristic of the window or convalescent period of HBV infection, which occurs after the disappearance of HBsAg and before the appearance of HBsAb (hepatitis B surface antibody).

In a chronic infection (Option B), HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA would be positive. The presence of HBeAg indicates high levels of viral replication and a high degree of infectivity.

If a patient is immune from vaccination (Option C), they would test positive only for HBsAb, as this is the only component of the virus included in the vaccine.

If a patient is immune from natural infection (Option D), they would test positive for both HBsAb and HBcAb, reflecting a past infection and subsequent immunity.

2297,"This patient's presentation of chest pain that worsens with deep inspiration, along with a pleural effusion demonstrated on chest x-ray, is suggestive of a pleural process. His pleural fluid analysis is compatible with an exudative pleural effusion (pleural lactate dehydrogenase >0.6 times the upper limit of normal serum value). Exudative effusions are typically due to malignancy, infection (eg, pneumonia, tuberculosis), connective tissue disease, trauma, and other less common causes. However, the patient's pleural fluid cytology reveals no abnormal cells, making malignancy less likely.

The patient's history of prolonged immobilization (Choice C) could explain his findings. Immobility increases the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE) can occur if a DVT dislodges and travels to the lungs.

2311,"This patient's right upper quadrant pain that worsens after eating is suggestive of biliary colic, a condition usually caused by gallstones.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer here is 'A': Connective tissue that envelops the other layers. 

The patient's symptoms are suggestive of gallstone disease, often presenting with right upper quadrant pain that worsens after meals. This is due to gallbladder contraction in response to food intake, primarily fat, which leads to the stone obstructing the cystic duct and causing pain. 

The nervous system within the gastrointestinal tract, the enteric nervous system, coordinates this response. The enteric nervous system has two components: the myenteric plexus (Auerbach's plexus) and the submucosal plexus (Meissner's plexus). The myenteric plexus is located between the longitudinal and circular layers of the muscularis externa and controls gastrointestinal motility. The submucosal plexus is located in the submucosa and controls secretion, absorption, and local blood flow. The perineurium, a connective tissue layer, envelops these plexuses, thus 'A' is the correct answer.

As for the other options:

'B': Contains cells that primarily absorb nutrients - This refers to the mucosal layer. While the mucosal layer does contain some enteric nerves, most of the nerve fibers are located within the plexuses.

'C': Contains large blood vessels and large lymphatic vessels - This refers to the submucosa. While the submucosa does contain the Meissner's plexus, the question is asking about the nerve fibers that transmit the sensation of food in the GI tract.

'D': Contracts to generate peristaltic waves - This refers to the muscularis externa layer. While this layer contains the Auerbach's plexus, it primarily controls GI motility, not sensation.

'E': Contracts to generate local movement in mucosa - This refers to the muscularis mucosae, a smooth muscle layer in the mucosa that controls local movement. While this layer does contain some enteric nerves, most of the nerve fibers are located within the plexuses."

The first-line treatment for GAD includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). In this case, the best answer would be escitalopram (Option A), an SSRI, because it is considered the first-line pharmacotherapy for GAD. 

Option B, Propranolol, is a non-selective beta blocker that is used primarily for treating hypertension, angina, and arrhythmias. It can be used as a second-line treatment for the somatic symptoms of anxiety (eg, tremors, palpitations), but is not the first choice for GAD.

Option C, Clonazepam, is a benzodiazepine. Although benzodiazepines can provide immediate relief from acute symptoms of GAD, they are not considered first-line treatment due to the risk of dependency and withdrawal symptoms.

Option D, Amitriptyline, is a tricyclic antidepressant. It is not considered first-line treatment for GAD due to its side effect profile, which includes anticholinergic effects, orthostatic hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmias.

Option E, Buspirone, is a 5-HT1A receptor agonist that is used in the treatment of GAD. However, it has a slow onset of action (may take up to 2-4 weeks for therapeutic effects to develop) compared with SSRIs and SNRIs. Thus, it would not be the best choice in this case."
2336,"The answer is C: Bigeminy.

This patient's malnutrition secondary to anorexia nervosa has caused a number of complications, as reflected by her physical exam findings of bradycardia, amenorrhea, and lower extremity edema. However, the most concerning finding that warrants hospitalization is her ECG showing frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and episodes of bigeminy (ie, every other beat is a PVC). Bigeminy is a sign of ventricular arrhythmia, which may precede more serious arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, potentially leading to sudden cardiac death. Malnutrition in anorexia nervosa can lead to electrolyte disturbances (eg, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia) or structural myocardial changes that impair cardiac function and can cause serious arrhythmias.

Option A: BMI of 17.1 kg/m2, although a sign of undernutrition (healthy range: 18.5-24.9 kg/m2), does not necessitate hospitalization alone.

Option B: Amenorrhea, though concerning and a criterion for the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, is not an immediate risk for mortality and does not warrant hospitalization.

Option D: Pulse 55/min, a sign of starvation-induced bradycardia, does not itself necessitate hospital admission unless associated with hemodynamic instability.

This patient with anorexia nervosa has an abnormal cardiopulmonary exam and ECG findings (bigeminy), indicating severe cardiac involvement. Anorexia nervosa is associated with numerous medical complications that affect multiple organ systems, and the severity of these complications can influence the decision of whether to manage the patient in an inpatient or outpatient setting. Indications for inpatient treatment of anorexia nervosa include severe malnutrition (BMI <16 kg/m2 or rapid, progressive weight loss), electrolyte disturbances, physiologic instability (eg, vital sign abnormalities), cardiac arrhythmias, acute medical complications of malnutrition (eg, syncope, seizures), and psychiatric criteria (eg, suicidal ideation, uncontrollable binge eating and purging). This patient's ECG finding of bigeminy is concerning for significant cardiac compromise and justifies inpatient management.

Option A: Severe malnutrition is indicated by a BMI <16 kg/m2. This patient's BMI of 17.1 kg/m2, although on the low end of the normal range, is not an indication for hospitalization.
Option B: Amenorrhea is a common finding in anorexia nervosa due to decreased gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus, leading to low levels of estrogen. It is not an indication for hospitalization.
Option D: Bradycardia (heart rate <60/min) is common in anorexia nervosa due to decreased cardiac mass and output, increased vagal tone, and decreased thyroid function, but isolated bradycardia is not an indication for hospitalization.
Option E: Edema can occur in anorexia nervosa due to decreased albumin production, but it is not an indication for hospitalization unless associated with other severe medical complications."
2357,"The correct answer is A. Digoxin.

Digoxin is derived from the foxglove plant and is used to treat atrial fibrillation and heart failure. Digoxin toxicity can occur with chronic use, especially in older adults and those with renal insufficiency. Clinical features of toxicity include gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and diarrhea), neurologic symptoms (fatigue, weakness, confusion, dizziness, and visual disturbances such as yellow or green color changes, halos, and photophobia), and cardiovascular manifestations. The latter typically include arrhythmias, and the most characteristic rhythm is bidirectional ventricular tachycardia, as described in this patient. This arrhythmia, although relatively rare, is almost pathognomonic of digoxin toxicity.

Option B: Quinidine can cause tinnitus and headache but does not produce the ventricular arrhythmia or severe diarrhea seen in this patient.

Option C: Lidocaine is an antiarrhythmic drug that is generally well-tolerated, but may cause confusion and other central nervous system effects in high doses. It does not cause the symptoms described in this patient.

Option D: Amiodarone can cause visual disturbances and gastrointestinal side effects, but it does not typically cause tinnitus or the characteristic ventricular arrhythmia seen in this patient.

Her ECG indicates the presence of a multifocal ventricular tachycardia with continuous change in the QRS electrical axis. Which of the following drugs is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms?
Option: {'A': 'Digoxin', 'B': 'Quinidine', 'C': 'Lidocaine', 'D': 'Amiodarone', 'E': 'Verapamil'}

The patient's symptoms of tinnitus, headache, visual disturbances (such as yellowish vision or scotomas), and severe diarrhea, along with the ECG findings of multifocal ventricular tachycardia with a continuously changing QRS axis (also known as the ""bidirectional"" VT), are indicative of digoxin toxicity. Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside used to treat conditions such as atrial fibrillation, as it slows the ventricular rate. However, it has a narrow therapeutic index, and toxicity can occur due to factors like renal dysfunction, hypokalemia, drug interactions, or accidental overdose.

Quinidine (B) can cause tinnitus and headache but usually does not cause the visual disturbances or the specific ECG changes seen in this patient. Lidocaine (C) is more associated with CNS and cardiovascular toxicity (seizures, confusion, bradycardia or heart block) rather than the gastrointestinal and visual symptoms seen here. Amiodarone (D) can cause a multitude of side effects, including pulmonary fibrosis, thyroid dysfunction, and liver disease, but it is not typically associated with the symptoms and ECG changes described in this patient. Verapamil (E) can cause constipation, not diarrhea, and its overdose presents with bradycardia and hypotension, not with the ventricular tachycardia seen in this patient."
2381,"The correct answer is B. HMG-CoA.

This patient was started on a statin, which is a medication that inhibits the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, and its inhibition leads to decreased cholesterol production in the liver. This, in turn, prompts the liver to increase LDL receptors on its surface, further decreasing circulating LDL cholesterol levels. Statins are first-line therapy for patients with a history of coronary artery disease or those at high risk for it, such as this patient with exertional chest pain (a symptom of angina), diabetes, and a strong family history of myocardial infarction. However, statins can cause myopathy, presenting as muscle pain and weakness. In severe cases, it can progress to rhabdomyolysis, a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by muscle cell death and release of muscle cell contents, including creatine kinase, into the bloodstream. This patient's markedly elevated creatine kinase level suggests she has developed rhabdomyolysis.

The other options are incorrect because:

A. Farnesyl pyrophosphate is a downstream product in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway but no drugs that inhibit its production are commonly used in clinical practice, and it is not associated with the development of rhabdomyolysis.

C. Lanosterol is a downstream product in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway but no drugs that inhibit its production are commonly used in clinical practice, and it is not associated with the development of rhabdomyolysis.

D. Mevalonic acid is a downstream product of HMG-CoA in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, but no drugs that inhibit its production are commonly used in clinical practice, and it is not associated with the development of rhabdomyolysis.

She currently takes aspirin and metformin. Her primary care provider starts her on a medication which is indicated given her medical history and current symptoms.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The patient's symptoms of exertional chest pain are indicative of angina, a condition usually caused by atherosclerosis, or hardening and narrowing of the arteries supplying the heart. The treatment of choice for atherosclerosis is a class of drugs known as statins, which work by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme that is key in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. This lowers the amount of cholesterol in the body, which can reduce the progression of atherosclerosis and lower the risk of heart attacks. However, a known side effect of statin use is myopathy, or muscle damage, which can present with symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness, as well as elevated levels of creatine kinase, a marker of muscle damage. Therefore, the correct answer is B, HMG-CoA.

The other options listed are all intermediates in the biosynthesis of cholesterol, but they are not the direct products of the enzyme that statins inhibit. Farnesyl pyrophosphate (Option A) is an intermediate in the mevalonate pathway, which is downstream of HMG-CoA reductase. Lanosterol (Option C) is a downstream product of squalene in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. Mevalonic acid (Option D) is the product of the reaction catalyzed by HMG-CoA reductase, but it is not the substrate for the enzyme that statins inhibit. Squalene (Option E) is an intermediate in the cholesterol synthesis pathway that is downstream of HMG-CoA reductase. Therefore, none of these options are correct."
2388,"This patient's presentation of hypertension, fatigue, weight loss, fever, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, along with evidence of upper extremity muscular atrophy and vascular abnormalities on imaging, suggest Takayasu arteritis (TA). TA is a large-vessel vasculitis that most commonly affects the aorta and its primary branches. The inflammation and scarring can result in arterial stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm. TA often presents with nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, fatigue, weight loss, and fever. As the disease progresses, patients may experience symptoms of vascular insufficiency (eg, claudication, reduced or absent pulses, blood pressure discrepancies, bruits). 

The treatment of TA generally involves two phases - induction of remission and maintenance of remission. High-dose glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone) are the first-line therapy to induce remission. The next step in managing this patient, who has shown improvement on prednisone, is to start a steroid-sparing agent to maintain remission, reduce the cumulative glucocorticoid dose, and minimize glucocorticoid-related side effects. 

Cyclophosphamide (Option B) is frequently used for this purpose in patients with TA, making it the correct answer.

The other options are not typically used in the management of TA:

- Carvedilol + hydrochlorothiazide (Option A) are antihypertensives, which might be needed for blood pressure control but are not disease-modifying treatments for TA.

Given all these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Takayasu arteritis.

Takayasu arteritis is a chronic large-vessel vasculitis that typically affects the aorta and its major branches. The disease often presents in young females and is characterized by granulomatous inflammation of the arterial media, leading to stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm.

The first-line treatment for Takayasu arteritis is corticosteroids like prednisone. If symptoms don't improve or relapse occurs when steroids are withdrawn, the next step is to add a steroid sparing immunosuppressive agent, like methotrexate, azathioprine, or cyclophosphamide. Therefore, the correct answer is option B, Cyclophosphamide.

The reason why the other options are incorrect is as follows:

A - Carvedilol + hydrochlorothiazide: these are antihypertensive drugs which may help manage symptoms but do not address the underlying cause of the inflammation.

C - Plasmapheresis: this procedure is typically reserved for severe, rapidly progressive cases of vasculitis affecting vital organs. It also does not address the root cause of inflammation.

D - Rituximab: this drug is a monoclonal antibody against CD20, a protein expressed on the surface of B cells. While it has been used in certain cases of vasculitis, its use is not the typical next step in managing Takayasu arteritis.

E - Surgery: surgical intervention, like bypass grafting or stenting, may be necessary in some cases of Takayasu arteritis to manage complications or if medical therapy has failed. However, it's generally recommended to control the disease activity with medical therapy before considering surgical intervention."
2395,"The patient's symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, and pallor suggest anemia. Given his history of acute kidney injury, the most likely cause of his anemia is chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The history of alcoholic hepatitis provides an important clue to the underlying cause of the anemia. Chronic alcohol abuse is associated with macrocytic anemia due to direct toxic effect of alcohol on the bone marrow as well as associated folate deficiency. Folate deficiency impairs synthesis of purines and thymidylate, which leads to defective DNA synthesis, impaired cell division, and the production of large, immature red blood cells (macrocytes). Macrocytosis may also be seen in conditions associated with ineffective or abnormal erythropoiesis (eg, myelodysplastic syndromes, drugs), liver disease, hypothyroidism, and certain medications (eg, hydroxyurea, zidovudine). Hence, the correct answer is 'D': Mutation in cytoskeletal proteins. 

Option 'A': Abnormal triglyceride handling is not associated with anemia. Dyslipidemias may result from disorders in lipid metabolism, but they do not directly affect red blood cell production or morphology.

Option 'B': Increased production of platelet-derived growth factor may lead to conditions like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or atherosclerosis, but it is not typically associated with anemia.

Option 'C': Inhibition of metalloproteinase activity plays a role in conditions such as cancer and fibrosis by preventing the breakdown of extracellular matrix. It does not directly affect red blood cell production or morphology.

2399,"This patient's muscle weakness, gait disturbance, and calf pseudohypertrophy are characteristic of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), which is caused by absent dystrophin (Choice B) due to a mutation in the dystrophin gene. Dystrophin is a protein that helps to strengthen muscle fibers and protect them from injury as muscles contract and relax. The absence of dystrophin in muscle cells leads to progressive muscle weakness and degeneration. Most patients with DMD become symptomatic between the ages of 1 and 3, typically presenting with delayed motor milestones, difficulty running and climbing stairs, and frequent falls. As the disease progresses, patients develop a characteristic waddling gait due to weakness of the gluteal muscles and lumbar lordosis.

This statement is the most accurate and immediate response to the patient's request. It educates the patient about the relationship between anxiety and blood pressure and explains why the medication he's requested isn't appropriate for his diagnosis of hypertension.

Option 'A' is incorrect because, while alprazolam can indeed cause dependence, the statement doesn't address the patient's misunderstanding about the impact of anxiety on blood pressure nor his inappropriate medication request.

Option 'B' is incorrect because it's unnecessary to consult a psychiatrist at this point. The patient's request for alprazolam may not indicate a psychiatric disorder, but rather a misunderstanding about his condition and medication.

Option 'D' is incorrect because it doesn't provide an immediate correction to the patient's misconception. While asking the patient about his understanding is a part of patient education, the physician should first correct false information.

Option 'E' is not entirely incorrect, but it lacks the immediate explanation about why alprazolam isn't appropriate for this patient.

2415,"The correct answer is E: Smoking cessation.

Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. It can be caused by a variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Risk factors for pneumonia include smoking, being hospitalized, having a chronic disease, and having a weakened or compromised immune system.

Option E: Smoking cessation is the most likely to have prevented this patient's pneumonia. Smoking damages the lungs' natural defenses against infections, making smokers more susceptible to respiratory infections like pneumonia. Quitting smoking can reduce this risk.

Option A: Incentive spirometry is often used after surgery or in patients with chronic lung disease to improve lung function and prevent atelectasis, not pneumonia.

Option B: Rapid sequence induction is a method used in anesthesia to secure the airway during emergency situations. It would not prevent pneumonia.

Option C: Prolonged bed rest can actually increase the risk of pneumonia, not prevent it. When a person is bedridden, they are less likely to take deep breaths and clear their lungs, which can lead to the development of pneumonia.

Lobar pneumonia, the condition this patient is suffering from, is most commonly caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae.

2426,"The correct answer is E: Pneumocystis jirovecii.

This patient's low leukocyte count and profound neutropenia (neutrophil count of approximately 385/mm3) is most likely due to her recent chemotherapy. Neutrophils are the primary defense against bacterial and fungal infections. Therefore, patients with neutropenia are at an increased risk for severe bacterial and fungal infections. Pneumocystis jirovecii, an opportunistic fungal pathogen, is a significant cause of pneumonia in patients with profound, prolonged neutropenia. The fungal organism is ubiquitous and typically causes asymptomatic infection or mild upper respiratory tract disease in immunocompetent hosts. However, in immunocompromised hosts (eg, HIV/AIDS, hematologic malignancies, solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, high-dose glucocorticoid use), it can cause Pneumocystis pneumonia, which presents with fever, nonproductive cough, and dyspnea.

Option A: Enterococcus faecalis is a common cause of urinary tract and wound infections but it would not be the primary concern in a profoundly neutropenic patient.

Option B: Gardnerella vaginalis primarily causes bacterial vaginosis, a condition characterized by vaginal discharge. It is not a primary concern in neutropenic patients.

Option C: Giardia lamblia is a protozoan parasite that causes giardiasis, presenting with symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal cramps, bloating, and weight loss. It does not have a specific predilection for neutropenic patients.

Granulocytes, which include neutrophils, are a critical part of the immune systemÃ¢â?¬â?¢s defense against bacterial and fungal infections. When the granulocyte count is low (granulocytopenia), a patient is at risk for severe, life-threatening infections. In the case of this patient, her chemotherapy treatment has resulted in a decreased number of neutrophils, a condition known as neutropenia.

One of the most dangerous infections in neutropenic patients is Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii) pneumonia (PCP). PCP is an opportunistic infection, meaning it takes advantage of a weakened immune system, and is often seen in patients with HIV/AIDS. In recent years, however, it has also become a significant threat to those with other forms of immunosuppression, such as patients undergoing chemotherapy like this woman.

The other options are less likely causes of severe infection in neutropenic patients:

Option A: Enterococcus faecalis is a bacterium that can cause infections, but it is not specifically associated with neutropenia.

Option B: Gardnerella vaginalis is associated with bacterial vaginosis, a condition that is not particularly related to the status of the immune system.

Option C: Giardia lamblia is a parasite that can cause diarrheal illness, but again, it is not specifically associated with neutropenia.

Option D: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can cause severe disease in immunocompromised patients, but it is typically associated with defects in cell-mediated immunity, such as in patients with AIDS or who have undergone organ transplantation. Also, CMV infections are rather rare in comparison to Pneumocystis jirovecii in the context of neutropenia."
2475,"This patient's progressive paresthesias and loss of temperature sensation over her upper extremities and chest suggest a spinal cord lesion following her motor vehicle accident. Her normal fine touch sensation suggests a dissociated sensory loss, characteristic of syringomyelia, a cystic cavity (syrinx) within the central canal of the spinal cord. The most common cause of syringomyelia is Chiari type I malformation, but it can also follow trauma, as in this patient. The crossing fibers of the spinothalamic tract in the anterior white commissure are affected first, leading to a ""cape-like"" loss of pain and temperature sensation in the upper extremities. Fine touch sensation is preserved because the dorsal columns are spared. Over time, the syrinx can expand and affect other tracts within the cord. The ventral horn (lower motor neurons) can be affected, leading to muscle atrophy, weakness, and areflexia, not hyperreflexia (Choice A). Therefore, this patient is at increased risk for developing an 'absent knee-jerk reflex' (Choice E).

Choice B is incorrect. Cognitive impairment (eg, decreased Mini-Mental State Examination score) is not associated with syringomyelia.

Choice C is incorrect. The anal wink reflex (contraction of the external anal sphincter upon stroking of perianal skin) is not typically affected in syringomyelia as this reflex involves sacral cord levels (S2-S4) which are often spared.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is 'B: Decreased Mini-Mental State Examination score'. 

The clinical scenario is consistent with syringomyelia, a condition characterized by the development of a fluid-filled cyst (syrinx) within the spinal cord. Trauma is a common cause of syringomyelia. The syrinx typically expands slowly, damaging the spinal cord by compressing and disrupting nervous tissue. Expansion of the syrinx into the anterior white commissure of the spinothalamic tract (which crosses the midline at the level of entry) first interrupts pain and temperature sensation from the opposite side, producing a ""cape-like"" bilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation in the upper extremities. As the syrinx expands, it may affect other neural structures, including the lateral corticospinal tracts (causing upper motor neuron signs such as spasticity and hyperreflexia) and lower motor neurons at the affected level (causing flaccid paralysis and muscle atrophy). If the syrinx reaches the brainstem (syringobulbia), it can lead to altered consciousness and cognitive impairment, hence the 'Decreased Mini-Mental State Examination score' option.

Option 'A: Exaggerated biceps reflex' would be incorrect as syringomyelia typically presents with decreased reflexes due to damage to the anterior horn cells.

Option 'C: Absent anal wink reflex' is incorrect as syringomyelia typically presents with damage to the upper parts of the spinal cord, not the sacral segments responsible for the anal wink reflex. 

Option 'D: Drooping of the eyelid' (ptosis) would be incorrect, as this is not a typical presentation of syringomyelia.

Option 'E: Absent knee-jerk reflex' is incorrect as the knee-jerk reflex is mediated by the L2-L4 nerve roots, which are not typically affected in syringomyelia."
2556,"The most likely diagnosis for this patient is hemophilia B, which is characterized by a deficiency in Factor IX (option B). Hemophilia B is a type of hemophilia, a condition that affects the body's ability to control blood clotting. It's an X-linked recessive disorder, which explains why the patient's uncle also had similar problems, as his mother is likely a carrier.

The patient's increased propensity for bruising and the prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) are indicative of a coagulation factor deficiency. Normal prothrombin time (PT) and bleeding time (BT) rule out deficiencies in the extrinsic pathway (factors II, V, VII, and X) and platelet defects, respectively.

Option A (Factor VIII deficiency) is incorrect because this would result in hemophilia A, which is more common than hemophilia B but does not fit this patient's laboratory results as well as hemophilia B does.

Option C (Factor VIII antigen deficiency) is incorrect because it refers to an acquired condition in which the immune system produces antibodies that inactivate factor VIII, leading to acquired hemophilia A. This condition is rare and usually occurs in elderly patients or pregnant women.

Option D (GP1b deficiency) would lead to a condition known as Bernard-Soulier syndrome, which is characterized by thrombocytopenia, large platelets, and a prolonged bleeding time. However, this patient's normal platelet count and bleeding time make this diagnosis unlikely.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The diagnosis in this patient is hemophilia B, which is caused by deficiency of factor IX (choice B). This X-linked recessive disorder primarily affects males. Patients usually present in childhood with a history of excessive bleeding after minor trauma, surgery, or even spontaneously. Recurrent hemarthroses are a classic presentation and can lead to chronic, debilitating arthropathy. Deep tissue (eg, intramuscular), GI, and CNS bleeding may also occur. In contrast to platelet disorders (eg, von Willebrand disease, immune thrombocytopenic purpura), mucocutaneous bleeding (eg, epistaxis, easy bruising, menorrhagia, gingival bleeding) is less common. Laboratory studies typically demonstrate a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) with a normal prothrombin time (PT) and bleeding time. The diagnosis is confirmed by a factor assay demonstrating decreased factor IX activity.

Hemophilia A (choice A) is similar to hemophilia B but is caused by deficiency of factor VIII. Both conditions present similarly and cause a similar pattern of laboratory abnormalities (ie, isolated prolonged aPTT). Hence, only a factor assay can differentiate hemophilia A from hemophilia B.

Some patients with hemophilia A develop factor VIII inhibitors (choice C), which are alloantibodies that bind to factor VIII and render it nonfunctional. These antibodies are quantified as Bethesda units. Patients with high-titer inhibitors often require treatment with bypassing agents or recombinant factor VIIa.

Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (choice E) is characterized by antiplatelet antibodies, which leads to platelet destruction in the spleen. It causes bleeding and bruising but would also cause a decrease in the platelet count, which is not seen here.

Bernard-Soulier syndrome (choice D) is caused by a deficiency in the GP1b receptor, which mediates platelet adhesion to von Willebrand factor. This leads to a platelet adhesion disorder. It would cause prolonged bleeding time but not a prolonged aPTT, and platelet count may be reduced or normal."
2585,"The answer is C: Finger extension.

This patient's history and radiograph are consistent with a supracondylar fracture of the humerus, a common elbow fracture in children that typically occurs after a fall on an outstretched hand (FOOSH injury). The distal fragment of the humerus is displaced posteriorly due to the pull of the triceps muscle, and the fracture line is typically above (ie, proximal to) the humeral condyles.

The most common complication of supracondylar fractures is injury to the brachial artery and the median nerve, which runs with the artery. The anterior interosseous nerve, a branch of the median nerve, may also be damaged. The anterior interosseous nerve primarily innervates the flexor pollicis longus, flexor digitorum profundus (index and middle fingers), and the pronator quadratus. Thus, patients may have difficulty making the ""OK"" sign (ie, flexing the thumb and index finger).

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a small-to-medium vessel vasculitis that commonly presents with upper respiratory tract (eg, sinusitis, otitis, mastoiditis), lower respiratory tract (eg, cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea), and renal (eg, hematuria, red cell casts) involvement. Other symptoms may include constitutional symptoms (eg, fatigue, anorexia, fever) and migratory arthralgias or arthritis. The serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen are elevated due to glomerulonephritis. The hematuria and proteinuria on urinalysis can be attributed to glomerular inflammation. If glomerulonephritis is present in the setting of vasculitis, the next best step in diagnosing vasculitis involves checking for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs), which are often present in granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

2744,"The correct answer is C: â?? â?? no change.

Lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that is frequently used in the management of hypertension, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus. ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor that also stimulates the release of aldosterone. ACE inhibitors thus reduce systemic vascular resistance and lower blood pressure.

In the kidneys, angiotensin II preferentially constricts efferent arterioles, leading to increased glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR). By inhibiting the production of angiotensin II, ACE inhibitors decrease the preferential constriction of efferent arterioles, leading to a decrease in glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and GFR.

ACE inhibitors also decrease renal plasma flow (RPF) because they cause dilation of both afferent and efferent arterioles, but the effect on efferent arterioles is more pronounced. This results in a decrease in renal perfusion pressure, which decreases RPF.

The filtration fraction (FF) is the ratio of GFR to RPF. Despite the decreases in both GFR and RPF, the FF remains relatively unchanged after initiation of ACE inhibitor therapy because both the numerator (GFR) and the denominator (RPF) of the ratio decrease.

Lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. ACE inhibitors prevent the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor that also stimulates the secretion of aldosterone. Thus, ACE inhibitors result in vasodilation and decreased fluid volume, leading to a decrease in blood pressure. 

In the kidneys, angiotensin II preferentially constricts efferent arterioles (more than afferent arterioles), which increases pressure in the glomerulus and helps to maintain glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in a variety of conditions. ACE inhibitors, by reducing angiotensin II production, decrease efferent arteriolar constriction, reduce intraglomerular pressure, and thus decrease GFR. At the same time, these drugs reduce the overall renal plasma flow due to their systemic and renal vasodilatory effects. 

The filtration fraction, which is the ratio of GFR to renal plasma flow, remains relatively unchanged as both the GFR and renal plasma flow decrease similarly.

The other options are incorrect:

'A': ACE inhibitors decrease both GFR and renal plasma flow, not increase them. The filtration fraction doesn't increase.

'B': Filtration fraction doesn't decrease, it remains relatively unaffected as both GFR and renal plasma flow decrease.

'E': Filtration fraction doesn't increase, it remains relatively unchanged."
2777,"The clinical presentation of the patient is suggestive of metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis. This is evident from her deep and rapid respirations (Kussmaul respirations), which are the body's attempt to compensate for the metabolic acidosis by blowing off CO2. The bicarbonate level of 16 mEq/L (normal 22-28 mEq/L) in the basic metabolic panel is also suggestive of primary metabolic acidosis. The ABG results showing a normal pH of 7.38, a decreased PaCO2 of 26 mmHg (normal 35-45 mmHg), and a normal PaO2 of 94 mmHg align with these findings.

Furthermore, the patient's elevated creatinine of 1.78 mg/dL suggests a kidney dysfunction. Kidney failure results in the inability to excrete acid (in the form of hydrogen ions) and regenerate bicarbonate, both of which can lead to metabolic acidosis. Hence, acute renal failure (Option D) is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation.

Option B (Severe sepsis) can cause lactic acidosis but the patient does not show symptoms of infection (e.g., fever, tachycardia, hypotension).

Option C (Medication overdose) can indeed cause metabolic acidosis but without more information on possible medications involved, it is difficult to select this as the most likely option.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's presentation of altered mental status with deep and rapid respirations (Kussmaul breathing), along with an arterial blood gas showing a low bicarbonate level and compensatory low PaCO2 are indicative of a metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation. The elevated creatinine suggests impaired renal function. The most common cause of an anion gap metabolic acidosis (calculated by the formula Na - {Cl + HCO3} which, in this case, is 21, an elevated value) in patients with renal failure is the accumulation of organic acids such as lactic acid or ketoacids. However, this patient's normal vital signs and absence of an evident source of infection argue against lactic acidosis secondary to sepsis. Therefore, her presentation is likely secondary to a ketoacidosis which, given her age and absence of a past medical history, is most likely due to previously undiagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus (choice A), leading to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). 

Severe sepsis (choice B) usually presents with changes in vital signs such as fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension, along with a source of infection, which this patient does not have. 

Medication overdose (choice C) may present with altered mental status but would not typically cause the biochemical changes observed here unless the medication involved causes metabolic acidosis, like salicylates. 

Acute renal failure (choice D) could cause a metabolic acidosis but it would typically be a non-anion gap acidosis due to inability to excrete hydrogen ions and reabsorb bicarbonate, which does not fit the scenario.

Alcohol binging (choice E) could lead to an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis due to alcoholic ketoacidosis, but this is often seen in chronic alcoholics, usually after a bout of heavy drinking followed by poor oral intake. There is no such history in this patient. Furthermore, alcohol binging would not typically result in an elevated creatinine as seen here. 

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this young woman with no past medical history is undiagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus presenting as DKA."

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's history of recent surgery, bipolar disorder treated with a typical antipsychotic (chlorpromazine), and findings of abdominal distention with hypoactive bowel sounds and cecal dilation >12 cm on imaging are suggestive of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO), also known as Ogilvie syndrome. ACPO is a serious condition that can lead to bowel perforation and death if not promptly treated. It is characterized by colonic dilation not due to a mechanical obstruction. Risk factors include recent surgery, severe illness, and medications such as anticholinergics and opioids. Because ACPO can lead to ischemia and perforation, it is important to decompress the bowel. The initial step in this is usually a colonoscopy (option B), not only for decompression but also to rule out other causes of obstruction. In patients who do not respond to conservative measures or have concerning signs (eg, peritonitis, high white blood cell count, severe acidosis), surgical consultation and possibly surgery (ie, cecostomy or colectomy) should be considered.

Option A, nasogastric and rectal tube insertion, may alleviate symptoms of distention, but it does not address the underlying problem of colonic dilation. Neostigmine (option C) is a parasympathomimetic agent that can be effective in ACPO, but it is generally reserved for patients who do not respond to or are not candidates for colonoscopic decompression. Option D, laparotomy, is a more drastic intervention that would be undertaken if the patient had signs of perforation or failed less invasive measures. Option E, intravenous fluids and bowel rest, while important supportive measures, also do not address the underlying issue of colonic dilation."

CTS is caused by median nerve compression as it passes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist. It is most common in overweight middle-aged women. Symptoms are due to impaired median nerve function and typically involve the first three digits and the lateral half of the fourth digit. Patients may also report clumsiness and weakness of the hand, but thenar atrophy is a late finding. First-line treatment is wrist splinting in a neutral position, especially at night.

3506,"The correct answer is D. Endoscopic ultrasonography.

This patient's presentation is concerning for pancreatic cancer. Risk factors include age >50, smoking, and chronic pancreatitis. Classic symptoms often include painless jaundice, weight loss, and vague abdominal discomfort. Pain usually occurs when the tumor invades local nerves and is often worse when lying down or eating. In up to 80% of patients, metastasis to regional lymph nodes, liver, or peritoneum has occurred by the time of diagnosis.

The first step in evaluation should be noninvasive imaging with transabdominal ultrasonography or CT to assess for a mass or dilated pancreatic or bile ducts. Transabdominal imaging in this patient shows dilated ducts but no mass, which could be due to a small pancreatic head mass not seen on ultrasound.

Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is the most appropriate next step for this patient given her high risk for pancreatic cancer and negative initial imaging. EUS has a higher sensitivity than transabdominal ultrasonography or CT for detecting small pancreatic tumors (Option C). EUS can also allow for fine-needle aspiration of suspicious lesions for cytology, which can provide a definitive diagnosis. 

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (Option E) is less commonly used for diagnosis because it is invasive and has a higher risk of complications compared to EUS. 

Although a plain abdominal CT (Option B) could also be used, it may not be as sensitive as a contrast-enhanced CT (Option C) or EUS in detecting small pancreatic tumors.

Pain from pancreatic cancer is typically steady, boring, and radiates to the back. It may be worse after meals and at night, and weight loss is common. Jaundice occurs when the tumor obstructs the bile duct as it passes through the head of the pancreas. Ductal dilation without an identifiable mass on transabdominal ultrasonography may be due to a small pancreatic cancer that is below the resolution of the ultrasound.

The next best step in the management of this patient would be endoscopic ultrasonography (option D). It is the most sensitive test for diagnosing pancreatic cancer, especially when the lesion is <3 cm. 

Colonoscopy (option A) is not appropriate because it evaluates the colon and rectum, not the pancreas or biliary tree and there are no symptoms suggestive of colon pathology. 

Plain abdominal CT (option B) is not as sensitive as other imaging modalities for pancreatic cancer. It may not detect small lesions or subtle pancreatic inflammation.

Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT (option C) is often performed following ultrasound to better characterize pancreatic lesions, but it is not as sensitive as endoscopic ultrasonography for small tumors or early-stage disease.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (option E) is predominantly therapeutic rather than diagnostic.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's presentation of acute-onset abdominal pain, adnexal tenderness, hemodynamic instability (tachycardia, hypotension), and a history suggestive of possible pregnancy is concerning for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized ovum implants outside the uterine cavity, most commonly in the fallopian tube. Risk factors include anything that impairs normal transport of the fertilized ovum to the uterus, such as tubal damage from prior pelvic inflammatory disease or prior tubal surgery. However, it can still occur in patients without risk factors. Symptoms occur when the implantation site becomes too stretched and ruptures, most commonly around the 6th to 10th week of gestation, leading to intra-abdominal hemorrhage that can be life threatening if not recognized and treated promptly.

Ectopic pregnancy can be diagnosed with transvaginal ultrasound in hemodynamically stable patients and Ã?Â²-hCG levels >1500 IU/L, which should allow for visualization of an intrauterine pregnancy. However, in unstable patients such as this one, the diagnosis can be made rapidly in the emergency department using a FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma) examination, which can detect intraperitoneal blood. Therefore, the next step in this patient's management should be a focused abdominal ultrasound (FAST) to assess for intraperitoneal blood (Option E). The FAST exam can be performed at the bedside in a few minutes and does not require patient transport, which could risk deteriorating the patient's condition.

Option A: Diagnostic laparoscopy is typically reserved for patients with unclear diagnosis after imaging. Since the patient is unstable, surgical intervention might be needed but first step would be to confirm the diagnosis.

Option B: In addition to resuscitation, the patient needs immediate diagnosis and treatment, not only fluid resuscitation.

Option C: CT scan would take more time than the FAST exam and may not be as sensitive in detecting intra-abdominal blood. In addition, given the patient's hemodynamic instability, it would not be safe to transport her out of the emergency department setting for this test.

It generally occurs after 20 weeks of gestation in previously normotensive women. Severe features include hypertension (systolic blood pressure â?¥160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure â?¥110 mm Hg) and/or symptoms (eg, headache, right upper quadrant or epigastric pain). Treatment with medications (eg, labetalol, hydralazine, nifedipine) is indicated in patients with severe hypertension to prevent maternal stroke. However, the definitive treatment of preeclampsia is delivery of the fetus. 

The patient's presentation with headache, tachycardia, and lower extremity pitting edema after starting an antihypertensive suggests she was given a drug that caused fluid retention due to systemic vasodilation (option E). However, the most commonly used drug with this mechanism of action, hydralazine, is not administered intravenously for hypertension in pregnancy. Methyldopa, an Î±2 adrenergic receptor agonist (option B), is an oral medication that is a first-line treatment for chronic hypertension in pregnancy. It lowers blood pressure by centrally reducing sympathetic outflow, but does not cause reflex tachycardia. Furthermore, although methyldopa can cause fluid retention, this is not a common effect.

Options A (combined Î² and Î±1 blocker), C (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor), and D (diuretic) are incorrect as these drugs are avoided in pregnancy due to potential fetal harm.

In summary, this patient's symptoms after starting an antihypertensive suggest she was given a drug that causes systemic vasodilation. However, the drug most likely to be used in this setting (pregnancy with severe hypertension) and administered in the manner described (intravenously) is an Î±2 adrenergic receptor agonist (methyldopa).","stop","the correct answer is b: activation of î±2 adrenergic receptors.","B","E","USMLE question: A 28-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, at 32 weeks' gestation is admitted to the hospital for the management of elevated blood pressures.

Her pulse is 116/min and regular, and blood pressure is 124/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows pitting edema of both lower extremities that was not present on admission. This patient most likely was given a drug that predominantly acts by which of the following mechanisms?
Option: {'A': 'Inhibition of Ã?Â²1, Ã?Â²2, and Ã?Â±1 receptors', 'B': 'Activation of Ã?Â±2 adrenergic receptors', 'C': 'Inhibition of angiotensin II production', 'D': 'Inhibition of sodium reabsorption', 'E': 'Direct dilation of the arterioles'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's presentation is consistent with preeclampsia, which is characterized by hypertension and either proteinuria or end-organ dysfunction after 20 weeks of gestation. Treatment includes delivery when the pregnancy is sufficiently advanced and fetal lung maturity is confirmed. Until then, severe hypertension (systolic >160 mm Hg or diastolic >105 mm Hg) should be managed with medications to prevent maternal stroke. Labetalol, nifedipine, and hydralazine are the primary antihypertensives used in the acute setting. This patient's new symptoms of headache and palpitations, along with a decrease in blood pressure and an increase in heart rate, suggest she may have been treated with labetalol, a competitive antagonist of both Ã?Â²1, Ã?Â²2, and Ã?Â±1 adrenergic receptors (option A). Ã?Â²1 receptor blockade can result in decreased heart rate and contractility, leading to decreased cardiac output and potentially causing reflex tachycardia. Ã?Â²2 receptor blockade can cause bronchoconstriction and peripheral vasoconstriction, while Ã?Â±1 receptor blockade can cause orthostatic hypotension, reflex tachycardia, and fluid retention.

Option B (Activation of Ã?Â±2 adrenergic receptors) is incorrect because drugs like clonidine and methyldopa, which act by activating Ã?Â±2 receptors, decrease blood pressure by reducing sympathetic outflow and would not cause tachycardia or fluid retention.

Option C (Inhibition of angiotensin II production) is incorrect because drugs like ACE inhibitors and ARBs that inhibit the production or action of angiotensin II may cause fetal renal damage and are contraindicated in pregnancy.

Option D (Inhibition of sodium reabsorption) is incorrect because diuretics, which act by inhibiting sodium reabsorption, are not typically used in the acute management of severe hypertension.

Option E (Direct dilation of the arterioles) is incorrect because hydralazine, a direct arteriolar vasodilator, can cause reflex tachycardia but not fluid retention.

Amniocentesis is a procedure in which a small amount of amniotic fluid is extracted from the uterus and analyzed for chromosomal abnormalities. This method allows for direct karyotyping of the fetal cells and is therefore considered definitive for diagnosing chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome. The procedure is typically performed between 15 and 20 weeks gestation.

Option B: Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is another procedure that allows for direct karyotyping of the fetal cells, and can be performed earlier in the pregnancy (between 10 and 13 weeks gestation) compared to amniocentesis. However, CVS carries a slightly higher risk of miscarriage than amniocentesis, making it a less preferable option in this scenario.

4001,"The answer is A: Obtain an electrocardiogram.

This patient's presentation of hypokalemia and hypertension suggests a diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn syndrome). Symptoms of hypokalemia typically occur at levels <3.0 mEq/L and can include fatigue, muscle weakness, and, less commonly, severe presentations such as rhabdomyolysis, paralysis, or respiratory failure. Cardiac manifestations include arrhythmias and ECG changes (eg, U waves, T-wave flattening, ST-segment depression, ventricular arrhythmias). Therefore, the initial step in evaluation of severe hypokalemia is to obtain an ECG to evaluate for cardiac abnormalities (Option A).

Option B: Administer potassium bicarbonate 50mEq per oral - This option is incorrect. Severe hypokalemia can cause life-threatening arrhythmias, and while potassium replacement will be necessary, it is not the next best step. An ECG should first be obtained to evaluate for arrhythmias. 

Option C: Administer potassium chloride 40mEq via peripheral IV - This option is incorrect. Although severe hypokalemia can be a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment, the first step should always be an EKG to evaluate for life-threatening arrhythmias. Intravenous replacement of potassium should only be performed if the patient is symptomatic or has EKG changes, as rapid correction can lead to complications.

Option D: Administer isotonic saline 1 liter via peripheral IV - This option is incorrect.

4184,"The correct answer is A: Macrophages with yellow-brown, lipid-containing granules.

This patient's history of thalassemia major and multiple blood transfusions suggests a diagnosis of secondary hemochromatosis due to chronic iron overload. This condition is usually a consequence of repeated transfusions in patients with diseases leading to chronic anemia, such as thalassemia major. Iron overload can be toxic and result in organ damage, including the liver. Histologically, this condition is characterized by the deposition of iron, which appears as yellow-brown, lipid-containing granules within macrophages.

Explanation:

This question is describing a patient with Ã?Â²-thalassemia major who has been receiving multiple blood transfusions. The most common complication of repeated blood transfusions is iron overload, also known as secondary hemochromatosis. Iron that is not utilized in erythropoiesis is stored in various tissues, such as the liver, heart, and endocrine organs. Within macrophages, iron is stored as hemosiderin, a yellow-brown, lipid-soluble material.

Option B is incorrect because macrophages with granules staining yellow with hematoxylin do not typically relate to iron overload.

Option C is incorrect because pink-staining proteins refer to amyloid, which is not related to thalassemia or iron overload.

Option D is incorrect because cytoplasmic brown-pigmented granules that stain positive for S-100 is a feature of melanoma, not Ã?Â²-thalassemia major or iron overload.

Option E is incorrect because cytoplasmic pink-staining granules that stain positive with PAS is a feature of certain glycogen storage diseases or lysosomal storage diseases, not Ã?Â²-thalassemia major or iron overload."
4285,"This patient's urinalysis showing 3+ reducing substances suggests the presence of a non-glucose reducing substance in the urine. In infants, the most common source of non-glucose reducing substances is galactose, which is found in breast milk and lactose-containing formulas. This indicates the patient may have galactosemia, a disorder characterized by deficient activity of one of the enzymes involved in galactose metabolism (galactokinase, galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase, or UDP-galactose-4-epimerase).

However, the question is asking what would happen if the child was given apple juice. Apple juice contains a high level of fructose. In a normal metabolism, fructose is primarily metabolized in the liver through a process that requires the enzyme fructokinase (Option C) to convert fructose to fructose-1-phosphate.

Option A, Aldolase B, is involved in the metabolism of fructose as well, but it acts later in the pathway, converting fructose-1-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde. If this patient has essential fructosuria (a deficiency in fructokinase), giving him apple juice will not increase the activity of aldolase B, as the substrate for this enzyme (fructose-1-phosphate) will not be formed.

Option B, Galactokinase, is involved in the metabolism of galactose, not fructose. Therefore, it's activity would not be increased by giving the patient apple juice.

Option D, Î±-1,6-glucosidase, also known as debranching enzyme, is involved in glycogen metabolism, and its activity would not be increased by apple juice.

A defect in the enzyme aldolase B is responsible for hereditary fructose intolerance. Aldolase B is required for the metabolism of fructose. When fructose is ingested (as in apple juice), it is phosphorylated by fructokinase to form fructose-1-phosphate. Aldolase B is then needed to further metabolize fructose-1-phosphate. Without aldolase B, fructose-1-phosphate accumulates and results in a trapping of inorganic phosphate with a resultant decrease in ATP. However, this patient is on a breast feeding diet which is rich in lactose (a disaccharide of glucose and galactose) not fructose.

The other options provided (Galactokinase, Fructokinase, Ã?Â±-1,6-glucosidase, and Hexokinase) are not the correct answers. Galactokinase is involved in galactose metabolism, and a deficiency would lead to galactosemia, not fructose intolerance.

Most bleeding disorders present at a young age, often noted after circumcision, dental procedures, or menarche. von Willebrand disease (vWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder and is due to a deficiency or defect in vWF, a protein that mediates platelet adhesion and carries factor VIII. Thus, it can present with both mucocutaneous bleeding (eg, epistaxis, menorrhagia, easy bruising) and also with bleeding after procedures. 

The initial screening tests for vWD are a complete blood count, prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). These tests are often normal in patients with vWD, but they are used to screen out other causes of abnormal bleeding. The most useful test is factor VIII coagulant activity because vWF carries factor VIII. Low factor VIII coagulant activity suggests vWD. Decreased ristocetin cofactor activity is also suggestive of vWD, but this test is more complex and is not usually performed initially.

Option B (Partial thromboplastin time (PTT)) is a basic screening test that is used to evaluate the intrinsic and common pathways of coagulation. It is not specific for vWD. Option C (Anti-cardiolipin antibodies) is a test for antiphospholipid syndrome, which is associated with hypercoagulability, not with increased bleeding. Option D (Ro/La autoantibodies) are seen in SjÃ?Â¶gren's syndrome and neonatal lupus, but they are not associated with bleeding disorders. Option E (Prothrombin time (PT)) is a basic screening test that evaluates the extrinsic pathway of coagulation.

5041,"The correct answer is E. Hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate have positive effects on cardiac remodeling. 

Cardiac remodeling is a pathophysiological process that occurs in response to cardiac injury and results in changes in the size, shape, structure, and function of the heart. Both ischemia and pressure or volume overload, as in the case of hypertension and heart failure, can result in remodeling. Hydralazine is a direct arterial vasodilator that reduces afterload, and isosorbide dinitrate is a venous vasodilator that reduces preload. Together, they reduce the workload of the heart and can counteract the adverse remodeling that occurs in heart failure.

Now, for the other options:

Option A: Hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate do not have anti-inflammatory properties to reduce the risk of coronary artery thrombosis. They primarily work by reducing the workload of the heart.

Option B: These medications do not increase the volume of blood that enters the heart. In fact, isosorbide dinitrate, by causing venodilation, reduces the amount of blood returning to the heart, decreasing preload.

Option C: Several clinical trials have shown that the combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate improves survival in patients with heart failure, particularly in African American patients. Thus, they do not just improve symptoms but also have a mortality benefit.

Option D: These medications do decrease the volume and work placed on the left ventricle, but this is an incomplete answer because it doesn't capture the broader benefits of these medications, including their positive effects on cardiac remodeling.","stop","the correct answer is e. hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate have positive effects on cardiac remodeling.","E","D","USMLE question: A 52-year-old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy presents to his cardiologist for worsening shortness of breath on exertion.

A repeat echocardiogram reveals a stable LVEF of 25-35%. The physician decides to start hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate. Which of the following is true regarding this medication combination?
Option: {'A': 'Has anti-inflammatory properties to reduce the risk of coronary artery thrombosis', 'B': 'Increases the volume of blood that enters the heart to improve ventricular contraction', 'C': 'Improves symptoms but do not have an overall mortality benefit in patients with congestive heart failure', 'D': 'Decreases the volume and work placed on the left ventricle', 'E': 'Has positive effects on cardiac remodeling'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is 'E': ""Has positive effects on cardiac remodeling.""

Hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate are vasodilators. The combination of these two medications is known to have multiple beneficial effects in patients with heart failure. They reduce afterload (the pressure against which the heart must work to eject blood) and preload (the volume of blood in the heart at the end of diastole). This results in decreased myocardial oxygen demand, increased cardiac output, and decreased ventricular volume. Hydralazine specifically is an arterial dilator which reduces systemic vascular resistance, decreasing afterload. Isosorbide dinitrate is a venous dilator which reduces preload. 

Combined, these medications have been shown to slow the progression of heart failure and reduce mortality, particularly in African American patients with symptomatic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. They are believed to have positive effects on cardiac remodeling, which is a process that occurs in patients with chronic heart disease characterized by changes in the size, shape, and function of the heart.

Option 'A' is incorrect as these medications do not have anti-inflammatory properties to reduce the risk of coronary artery thrombosis. 

Option 'B' is wrong as these drugs do not increase the volume of blood that enters the heart to improve ventricular contraction. In fact, they reduce the volume of blood in the heart (preload) and decrease the pressure the heart has to pump against (afterload). 

Option 'C' is incorrect as these medications not only improve symptoms of heart failure, but they have also been shown to have a mortality benefit in patients with congestive heart failure.

Option 'D' is partly correct; these medications do decrease the volume and work placed on the left ventricle, but this is not the primary action of these medications in treating heart failure. 

Therefore, the correct answer is 'E', as Hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate have positive effects on cardiac remodeling."
5042,"The correct answer is A, Pelvic ultrasound.

This patient's primary amenorrhea (absence of menses by age 15 in the presence of normal growth and secondary sexual characteristics), abdominal distention, and palpable abdominal mass suggest a mÃ¼llerian anomaly (eg, imperforate hymen, transverse vaginal septum, vaginal agenesis) with hematocolpos (ie, accumulation of menstrual blood in the vagina). The finding of Tanner stage 5 breast and pubic hair development indicates that estrogen from functional ovaries is being produced, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis is likely intact. This is consistent with the likely ability of the patient's ovaries to respond to cyclic gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary gland with menstrual bleeding.

This patient's secondary sexual characteristics, abdominal mass, and primary amenorrhea suggest a Mullerian anomaly, most likely imperforate hymen. Imperforate hymen is a congenital disorder of the genital tract characterized by a hymen without an opening. Therefore, menstrual blood cannot exit the vagina, leading to accumulation in the vagina (hematocolpos) and uterus (hematometra). Symptoms typically begin after menarche with cyclical abdominal pain due to menstrual blood accumulation. Other symptoms due to mass effect include urinary frequency, constipation, and, rarely, hydronephrosis. On examination, a lower abdominal mass can be palpated, corresponding to the distended uterus and vagina. The diagnosis is confirmed by imaging (ie, pelvic ultrasound) showing a distended vagina and uterus.

Option: {'A': 'Cystic fibrosis', 'B': 'Common variable immune deficiency', 'C': 'X-linked agammaglobulinemia', 'D': 'Otitis media', 'E': 'Kartagener syndrome'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This child's multiple respiratory tract infections, ear infections, productive cough, and hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia suggest a primary immunodeficiency. The most common primary immunodeficiencies that present with recurrent bacterial sinopulmonary infections are those that involve antibody deficiencies (eg, common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), X-linked agammaglobulinemia). However, this child's chest x-ray shows hyperinflation and bronchial wall thickening, which are suggestive of bronchiectasis. Bronchiectasis is a chronic dilation of the bronchi caused by repeated cycles of inflammation and infection, which lead to destruction of the bronchial wall and loss of the normal elastic recoil. This is more common in CVID (Choice B). 

CVID is characterized by low immunoglobulin levels and a poor response to vaccines, leading to increased susceptibility to bacteria (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae), especially those that encapsulated. Affected individuals often present in adolescence or adulthood, but the disease can manifest at any age. 

Cystic fibrosis and X-linked agammaglobulinemia can cause sinopulmonary infections, but the infectious organisms are usually different. Cystic fibrosis (Choice A) often causes infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Choice C) often has onset in infancy after the protective effect of maternal immunoglobulins wanes. Patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia have absent or small tonsils.

5053,"The fetus has a karyotype of 47,XXY, which is indicative of Klinefelter syndrome. This condition is a sex chromosome disorder in males that results from having one or more extra X chromosomes. Males with Klinefelter syndrome usually have small testes that do not produce enough testosterone, which is the hormone responsible for the development of male sexual characteristics. 

The lack of testosterone triggers the hypothalamus to produce gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which then stimulates the pituitary gland to produce high levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Despite the high levels of LH, the testes are not stimulated to produce sufficient testosterone, resulting in a testosterone deficiency (hypogonadism). Therefore, the hormonal changes expected in a person with Klinefelter syndrome at puberty are: 

- Increased FSH (due to the lack of negative feedback inhibition from the Sertoli cells in the testes)
- Increased LH (due to the lack of negative feedback inhibition from the Leydig cells in the testes)
- Decreased testosterone (due to the inability of the testes to produce enough testosterone)
- Normal estrogen (as it is primarily produced by the adrenal glands and fat tissue in males)

In terms of hormones, Klinefelter syndrome is characterized by primary testicular failure, which results in increased gonadotropins (follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] and luteinizing hormone [LH]) due to lack of feedback inhibition on the pituitary.

5069,"The correct answer is 'D: Hemolytic reaction when grown on sheep blood agar'. 

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a Gram-positive bacterium that typically causes pneumonia, meningitis, and other serious infections. Its virulence, or ability to cause disease, is largely dependent on its polysaccharide capsule and the production of several enzymes, one of which is pneumolysin. Pneumolysin is a pore-forming toxin that can cause lysis of host cells, which is evident as a hemolytic reaction when the bacteria are grown on sheep blood agar. So, a strain that is unable to cause disease is likely defective in pneumolysin production or another virulence factor, which would be evident as a lack of hemolysis on sheep blood agar.

The low reticulocyte count (normal: 0.5%-1.5%) indicates that this is not due to increased peripheral destruction or loss (e.g., hemolysis or bleeding) but rather a problem with the bone marrow's production of red blood cells. Alcoholism, seen likely in this patient based on the history, can lead to both direct bone marrow suppression as well as folic acid deficiency. 

Among the options, Folate deficiency (Option B) is the most likely diagnosis. Folate is a vitamin that is necessary for cell division and thus is crucial in periods of rapid cell turnover (e.g., erythropoiesis). Its deficiency, often due to poor nutrition (e.g., alcoholism, elderly with poor dietary intake), can lead to megaloblastic anemia. 

Option A, a benign genetic carrier condition, is less likely because this patient's severe anemia and low reticulocyte count suggest an acquired, not congenital, cause.

Option C, Iron deficiency, is a common cause of anemia, but it leads to microcytic (not normocytic or macrocytic) anemia and is less likely in this clinical context.

Option D, Parvovirus B19 infection, often causes anemia in patients with increased red cell turnover (e.g., sickle cell disease), but it would typically cause a reticulocytopenia and not a low reticulocyte count as seen here.

Option E, Vitamin B12 deficiency, can cause a similar megaloblastic anemia to folate deficiency. However, it is less likely in this case given that B12 deficiency is most commonly seen in those with malabsorption disorders (e.g., pernicious anemia, Crohn disease) and is rare in the general population (including alcoholics).

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's anemia (Hb 6 g/dL, Hct 20%), tachycardia (pulse 140/min), and history of alcoholism is suggestive of alcohol-induced bone marrow suppression, leading to a hypoproliferative anemia. Chronic alcohol consumption suppresses erythroid precursor cell proliferation and differentiation, leading to a reduced reticulocyte count, as seen in this patient (0.4%). The most common nutritional deficiency in alcoholics is folate deficiency (choice B). Folate is necessary for DNA synthesis and thus, cellular division. It is absorbed in the jejunum and stored in the liver. Chronic alcoholism affects both folate absorption and increases its urinary excretion. Alcohol also interferes with folate metabolism at the level of the liver. This patient's anemia is likely multifactorial due to both alcohol-induced bone marrow suppression and nutritional deficiency.

Iron deficiency (choice C) should also be considered in alcoholics due to poor diet. However, it tends to cause anemia with low MCV (microcytic) and high RDW due to the production of both normal and small-sized RBCs. In contrast, folate deficiency causes large RBCs (macrocytic anemia) due to impaired division.

Benign genetic carrier conditions (choice A) like thalassemias or sickle cell trait don't typically cause anemia unless there's another superimposed cause.

Parvovirus B19 (choice D) can cause transient aplastic crisis, manifesting as sudden-onset anemia, but is usually seen in patients with chronic hemolytic anemias (eg, sickle cell, hereditary spherocytosis).

Vitamin B12 deficiency (choice E) can cause a similar anemia, but is less common in alcoholics and more often seen in vegans and individuals with malabsorption syndromes (eg, pernicious anemia, Crohn disease).

5135,"The most appropriate recommendation is option B: 'Switch to lamotrigine for the 1st trimester.' 

Lithium has been associated with a small risk of cardiac malformations, particularly Ebstein anomaly, when used in the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the overall risk is still quite low. If a woman with bipolar disorder becomes pregnant or is planning pregnancy, the risks of medication exposure must be balanced against the risks of untreated psychiatric illness. 

Lamotrigine is often used in pregnancy for women with bipolar disorder as it has not been associated with major birth defects and has minimal impact on cognitive outcomes. It is preferred over other mood stabilizers during pregnancy.

Option A: 'Discontinue the lithium' would put the patient at risk of a bipolar relapse.

Option C: 'The fetus will be at risk for neural tube defects' is incorrect as this is primarily a risk with medications like valproate and carbamazepine, not lithium.

Option D: 'She can be maintained on valproate instead' is incorrect as valproate is associated with a high risk of neural tube defects and cognitive impairment in the fetus, and is typically avoided in pregnancy.

5147,"The correct answer is B: Elevated intracranial venous pressure. 

This patient's symptoms of chronic, intermittent headache refractory to NSAIDs, tinnitus, and transient visual obscurations (photopsias), along with physical examination findings of abducens nerve palsy and papilledema, are suggestive of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). IIH (also known as pseudotumor cerebri) is a condition of unknown etiology that is most commonly seen in obese women of childbearing age. The elevated intracranial pressure leads to papilledema, which can result in a peripheral visual field loss (eg, inferior nasal quadrant). Abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI) palsy, causing horizontal diplopia, is also common due to the nerve's long intracranial course and relatively exposed location in the subarachnoid space. The diagnosis of IIH is made by documenting elevated intracranial pressure (eg, opening pressure >25 cm H2O) on lumbar puncture, with no abnormalities seen on neuroimaging.

Option A, C, D and E are incorrect.

A: Arachnoid granulation adhesions could lead to communicating hydrocephalus, which is not what is described here.

C: Aqueductal stenosis would lead to obstructive (non-communicating) hydrocephalus, which is not the case here.

D: Increased cerebrospinal production could cause hydrocephalus but is not the likely mechanism in this case.

Option B, elevated intracranial venous pressure, is incorrect. While this can lead to increased intracranial pressure, the venous system is not typically implicated in IIH.

Option C, aqueductal stenosis, is incorrect. This condition causes obstructive hydrocephalus, which would likely have been evident on the patient's MRI.

Option D, increased cerebrospinal production, is incorrect. Overproduction of CSF is rare and is not the underlying issue in IIH.

It's also worth noting that IIH is most commonly seen in obese women of childbearing age, which fits this patient's demographics. The most common symptom is a headache, which is typically constant, worse in the morning and with Valsalva maneuvers. Neurologic examination may reveal cranial nerve VI (abducens) palsies, which can cause horizontal diplopia, particularly when the patient looks to the side.

5154,"The correct answer is C. Iron deficiency. 

This patient's fatigue, memory changes, irritability, non-specific muscle/joint pain, and constipation suggest a chronic systemic process. His laboratory findings reveal microcytic anemia, as indicated by the low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and hemoglobin, which is most commonly due to iron deficiency. Iron deficiency anemia can result from chronic blood loss (eg, gastrointestinal, menstrual), decreased iron absorption (eg, celiac disease), or poor nutrition. It can cause a variety of symptoms due to the role of iron in oxygen transport and storage. When tissues are hypoxic, a range of nonspecific systemic (eg, fatigue), neuropsychiatric (eg, difficulty concentrating), and even gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, constipation) can occur.

B: Azithromycin: This is an antibiotic used commonly for community-acquired pneumonia and other respiratory infections. There is no indication for its prophylactic use in this case.

C: Low dose acyclovir: A full dose of acyclovir should be used in this instance due to the high risk of viral reactivation in transplant patients.

5194,"The patient's history and physical examination are characteristic of psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin condition that results from keratinocyte hyperproliferation. Psoriasis is often associated with nail changes (eg, pitting, onycholysis) and psoriatic arthritis, which can present similarly to rheumatoid arthritis with symmetric joint involvement but also often involves the distal interphalangeal joints. Patients with moderate to severe psoriasis (involving >10% of body surface area), as seen in this patient, or those with joint involvement are often initially managed with systemic therapy, such as methotrexate or biologic agents, due to the severity of their disease. Methotrexate, a folate analog that inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, decreases DNA synthesis and cellular replication, particularly in rapidly dividing cells such as keratinocytes and inflammatory cells (choice C). Methotrexate also has anti-inflammatory effects that are beneficial in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis.

5199,"The correct answer is A. 'Abnormal relationship between the kidney and the superior mesenteric artery'.

Horseshoe kidney is the most common renal fusion anomaly. During embryologic development, the kidneys ascend from the pelvis to the retroperitoneal space in the abdomen. The presence of the inferior mesenteric artery typically prevents fusion of the lower poles of the kidneys. However, in horseshoe kidney, the kidneys fuse at the lower poles before ascent, and the fused mass of renal tissue gets trapped under the inferior mesenteric artery, preventing normal ascent. As a result, the horseshoe kidney is usually located in the lower abdomen and can be crossed anteriorly by the inferior mesenteric artery. The abnormal relationship between the kidneys and the mesenteric arteries may complicate surgical approaches to the aorta.

Option B, 'Anomalous origins of multiple renal arteries' is incorrect because although horseshoe kidney can be associated with multiple renal arteries, this does not typically complicate surgical procedures, as these arteries are normally encountered and controlled in renal surgery.

Option C, 'Low glomerular filtration rate due to unilateral renal agenesis' is incorrect because horseshoe kidney is not associated with renal agenesis.

Option D, 'Proximity of the fused kidney to the celiac artery' is incorrect as the horseshoe kidney is located lower in the abdomen, typically below the level of the superior mesenteric artery, and is not typically in close proximity to the celiac artery.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is A, 'Abnormal relationship between the kidney and the superior mesenteric artery', which is the most likely complication in the surgical approach for this patient. 

Horseshoe kidneys are the most common type of renal fusion anomaly. They occur when the two kidneys fuse together at the lower poles during development, forming a U shape that resembles a horseshoe. This condition causes the kidneys to get trapped under the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) during their ascent in embryonic development. They are, therefore, frequently located lower in the abdomen than normal kidneys. Horseshoe kidneys are associated with an increased risk of renal stones, hydronephrosis, and both benign and malignant tumors. 

In relation to this question, the abnormal relationship between the kidney and the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) may complicate the surgical approach. The SMA generally crosses anterior to the third part of the duodenum and the uncinate process of the pancreas. However, in the case of a horseshoe kidney, the isthmus of the horseshoe kidney usually passes anterior to the aorta and lies behind the SMA. 

Option B: Anomalous origins of multiple renal arteries can occur with normal kidneys or with horseshoe kidneys. However, these arteries can be protected during the procedure, so they are less likely than the SMA to complicate the surgical approach.

Option C: Horseshoe kidney does not lead to low glomerular filtration rate due to unilateral renal agenesis. Unilateral renal agenesis is a different condition where one kidney fails to develop.

Option D: The celiac artery is not typically involved or in proximity to a horseshoe kidney.

Option E: Is incorrect because there are additional complications that can arise due to the presence of a horseshoe kidney."
5205,"This boy's fever, unilateral periorbital erythema/swelling, ophthalmoplegia, and proptosis in the setting of recent trauma suggest a diagnosis of orbital cellulitis. This is a serious infection of the tissues posterior to the orbital septum. Etiologies often include sinusitis (eg, ethmoid sinusitis), dental infections, or spread from local trauma. Orbital cellulitis can cause ophthalmoplegia due to inflammation and abscess formation compressing the extraocular muscles and the cranial nerves that innervate them (eg, CN III, IV, VI). Untreated orbital cellulitis can lead to visual loss due to optic nerve damage. Therefore, the best answer choice is B: Decreased vision with sparing of the optic disc. 

Option A: Anesthesia along the CN V3 distribution is incorrect. CN V3 (mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve) provides sensation to the lower face and oral cavity, not the eye. 

Option C: Monocular diplopia (double vision in one eye) is typically due to a problem within the eye itself (eg, lens dislocation, refractive error), not an orbital process.

Option D: Intact sympathetic innervation to the pupil, but not parasympathetic innervation, would lead to mydriasis (dilated pupil) and is more suggestive of a lesion involving CN III (eg, compression from an aneurysm), not orbital cellulitis.

Option 'B', decreased vision with sparing of the optic disc, is the most likely sequela in this case. Orbital cellulitis can cause optic nerve damage due to the increased pressure in the orbital compartment (from inflammation and swelling), leading to decreased vision. However, the optic disc (the part of the optic nerve visible in the back of the eye) may appear normal in the early stages of this condition.

Option 'A': Anesthesia along the CN V3 distribution, or the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, is not typically associated with orbital cellulitis. This would be more suggestive of trigeminal neuralgia or a lesion affecting the trigeminal nerve.

Option 'C': Monocular diplopia (double vision in one eye) is typically related to a problem within the eye itself, such as a cataract or refractive error, rather than an issue with the muscles or nerves controlling eye movement.

Option 'D': While orbital cellulitis can cause ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of the eye muscles), it does not typically selectively spare sympathetic innervation to the pupil. Both sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation could likely be compromised due to the inflammation and swelling.

Option 'E': The blink reflex involves both the sensory limb (mediated by the trigeminal nerve) and the motor limb (mediated by the facial nerve). While this reflex may be impaired in conditions affecting these nerves, orbital cellulitis does not typically affect the trigeminal or facial nerves directly.

This patient's SpO2 is 90%, and he has evidence of right heart failure, likely secondary to his severe COPD, which qualifies him for oxygen therapy.

The other interventions would certainly be beneficial for the patient's health, but they have not been shown to reduce mortality in patients with COPD and cor pulmonale as effectively as oxygen therapy and smoking cessation.

Option A: The flu vaccine is recommended for patients with COPD, but it doesn't directly decrease mortality.
Option B: Smoking cessation alone is the most effective way to slow the disease progression, but in this case, the patient also needs oxygen therapy due to severe COPD and cor pulmonale.
Option C: ACE inhibitors are used in heart failure, but the primary cause of his symptoms is his lung disease, not a primary cardiac problem.

He also takes Prozac for a long-standing history of depression. The patient has a 60-pack-year smoking history. He also has a history significant for alcohol abuse, but he quit cold turkey 15 years ago when his brother was killed in a drunk driving accident. Both he and his brother were adopted, and he does not know other members of his biological family. Despite repeated efforts of patient counseling, the patient is not interested in quitting smoking. The physical exam is significant for an obese male using accessory muscles of aspiration. The vital signs include: temperature 36.8Ã?Â°C (98.2Ã?Â°F), heart rate 95/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and blood pressure 130/85 mm Hg. The oxygen saturation is 90% on room air.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The patient in question presents with clinical signs of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and right heart failure. The fact that the patient is experiencing shortness of breath when walking up stairs and lying down, as well as using extra pillows to help him breathe, indicates that he suffers from orthopnea, a common symptom of heart failure. Furthermore, the physical examination reveals peripheral edema, hepatomegaly, and ascites, all of which are signs of right heart failure. A heart sound S3, elevated JVP, and cyanotic lips are also common signs of congestive heart failure.

The patient's smoking history and symptoms of coughing and wheezing indicate COPD. Smoking is recognized as a cause of COPD, which is characterized by chronic bronchitis and emphysema. The patient's hyperresonance on percussion is a characteristic physical finding of emphysema. His pCO2 of 60 mm Hg is above normal indicating CO2 retention which is a result of airflow obstruction. Bicarbonate of 32 mmol/L indicates metabolic compensation for the chronic respiratory acidosis.

Option E: Both smoking cessation and oxygen administration is the correct answer. The patient's most immediate health risk is severe hypoxemia, a common complication of advanced COPD. Long-term oxygen therapy (>15 hours per day) has been shown to increase survival in patients with severe resting hypoxemia (PaO2 Ã¢â?°Â¤55 mmHg or SaO2 Ã¢â?°Â¤88%) which is lower than the patient's SaO2 of 90%. Smoking cessation is the only intervention shown to slow the progression of COPD.

Option A: Flu vaccine would help prevent respiratory infections, but it wouldn't directly decrease mortality in this patient.

Option B: Smoking cessation alone would slow the progression of COPD but wouldn't manage his current hypoxemia.

Option C: ACE inhibitors are beneficial in managing left-sided heart failure, but they have not been proven to reduce mortality in right-sided heart failure or COPD.

5207,"The woman's muscle weakness, trouble standing and grooming, and characteristic skin rash (likely a heliotrope rash on the face and Gottron's papules on the hands) suggest dermatomyositis, a type of inflammatory myopathy. It is characterized by inflammation of the muscles and skin and is most common in women. The muscle weakness often involves the proximal muscles, such as the shoulders and hips, and tends to be symmetrical. This patient's symmetrical proximal muscle weakness and the characteristic skin rash should prompt a suspicion of dermatomyositis. In the absence of the characteristic skin manifestations, muscle biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis. However, in this patient with characteristic skin findings, the diagnosis can be made clinically. Histological examination of the affected muscles in dermatomyositis shows perifascicular atrophy and CD4+ T cells infiltrating the perimysium, leading to muscle fiber necrosis. These changes are represented by the presence of intramuscular inclusion bodies on biopsy (Option D).

Option A (Anti-dsDNA antibodies) is seen in systemic lupus erythematosus, which can cause muscle inflammation but usually does not cause muscle weakness.

Option B (Symptom resolution on statin withdrawal) suggests statin-induced myopathy, which can cause muscle weakness, but is typically associated with muscle pain or tenderness, which this patient does not report.

Option C (Pathological edrophonium test) is positive in myasthenia gravis, which causes fluctuating muscle weakness that worsens with activity, not constant muscle weakness like this patient's.

Thus, muscle biopsy would likely reveal intramuscular inclusion bodies (Option D). DM is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. The rash of DM is often the first sign and can precede the muscle symptoms by weeks to months. DM is characterized by muscle inflammation and weakness, and skin changes. The muscle weakness is typically symmetrical and involves the proximal muscles. The skin changes often involve a heliotrope rash (blue-purple discoloration) on the upper eyelids with edema, a flat red rash on the face and upper trunk, and Gottron papules (red papules) over the knuckles, elbows, and knees. 

Option A: Anti-dsDNA antibodies are characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus. Although lupus and dermatomyositis can both cause a malar rash, the presence of Gottron papules is more characteristic of dermatomyositis. 

Option B: Although statins can cause myopathy, this would not explain the patient's rash. Furthermore, statin-induced myopathy would typically cause pain and tenderness, which this patient does not have.

Option C: A positive edrophonium test would suggest myasthenia gravis, but this patient's intact cranial nerve examination and lack of fatigable weakness make this diagnosis unlikely.

5212,"The clinical picture is suggestive of a severe head trauma with neurologic symptoms including altered mental status and flaccid paralysis of all extremities. This might be due to a severe brain injury such as an epidural hematoma, which occurs due to bleeding between the skull and the dura mater (Option C). This is often caused by a fracture of the temporal bone which ruptures the middle meningeal artery. Rapid blood accumulation in this potential space can lead to increased intracranial pressure, herniation, and death. Early symptoms may include loss of consciousness, followed by a lucid interval, and then subsequent deterioration with headache, vomiting, seizures, and contralateral hemiparesis or hemiplegia.

Option A (Into the ventricular system) refers to intraventricular hemorrhage, which commonly occurs in premature infants, or in adults secondary to hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage.

This can cause an acute neurological deterioration and potentially seizures, as stated in the vignette. The vomiting and disorientation can also be related to the increased intracranial pressure due to the hematoma.

Option 'A': 'Into the ventricular system' is less likely because this typically results from intraventricular hemorrhage, which presents with sudden severe headache, altered consciousness and occasionally seizures. However, the mechanism of injury does not favor this.

Option 'B': 'Between the dura mater and the arachnoid mater' and 'E': 'Between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater' are referring to subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhages respectively. Both are unlikely in this scenario as they don't typically cause flaccid paralysis of all extremities.

5213,"The correct answer is B. Roseola infantum.

This girl's high fever of several days duration that resolved just before the appearance of a rash is a classic presentation of roseola infantum (also known as exanthema subitum or sixth disease), a common illness of infancy and early childhood caused by human herpesvirus-6 or -7. Other nonspecific symptoms such as vomiting may also occur. The rash of roseola begins on the trunk and spreads to the extremities, sparing the face. It is rose-pink, blanching, nonpruritic, and maculopapular, with each individual lesion surrounded by a halo.

Option A: Nonbullous impetigo is a superficial skin infection commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. It is characterized by honey-colored crusts often preceded by vesicles or pustules.

Option C: Drug allergies usually cause a morbilliform (measles-like) rash that can occur anywhere on the body. The rash is pruritic and typically appears 7-10 days after drug exposure.

Option D: Rubella (German measles) also causes a maculopapular rash that spreads from the face to the trunk and extremities. However, rubella is typically associated with mild fever and upper respiratory symptoms, as well as cervical lymphadenopathy (vs postauricular in roseola).

Option A: Nonbullous impetigo typically presents as honey-colored crusts on the face and is caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, not associated with fever.

Option B: Roseola infantum, or Exanthem subitum, typically affects children aged 6 months to 2 years. It is characterized by a high fever for several days followed by a rash; however, the rash is diffuse and starts on the neck and trunk, spreading to the face and extremities, which is slightly different from the pattern in rubella.

It is also usually associated with mild constitutional symptoms and not high fever and vomiting. It does not typically have postauricular lymphadenopathy, which is characteristic of Rubella."
5216,"The correct answer is B, 'Paternal uniparental disomy.'

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder that typically presents with poor feeding and a weak cry in infancy, followed by rapid weight gain in early childhood and developmental delay. The most common mechanism for the development of PWS is paternal uniparental disomy (UPD), which occurs when both copies of a chromosomal region come from the same parent, in this case the father. In PWS, the paternal gene in the 15q11-13 region is required for normal development, and the maternal gene in this region is typically silenced. If both copies of this region come from the mother (as in maternal UPD), or if the paternal gene is deleted or mutated, PWS can result.

Option A, 'Heteroplasmy,' refers to the presence of both normal and mutated mitochondrial DNA, which can result in mitochondrial diseases. This does not relate to PWS.

Option C, 'Silencing in imprinting region,' is not the most common cause of PWS, although it can occur when the paternal gene in the 15q11-13 region is mutated or deleted.

Option D, 'Anticipation,' refers to the phenomenon where genetic diseases become more severe or appear at an earlier age as they are passed on to the next generation. This is not characteristic of PWS.

Option E, 'Incomplete penetrance,' refers to the fact that not all individuals with a mutated gene will express the phenotype associated with that gene. Again, this is not characteristic of PWS.","stop","the correct answer is b, 'paternal uniparental disomy.'","B","C","USMLE question: A 2-month-old boy is presented to the clinic for a well-child visit by his parents.

Option: {'A': 'Heteroplasmy', 'B': 'Paternal uniparental disomy', 'C': 'Silencing in imprinting region', 'D': 'Anticipation', 'E': 'Incomplete penetrance'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The most common mechanism for the development of Prader-Willi syndrome is option B: Paternal uniparental disomy. This condition results from the absence of a normal paternal contribution to the 15q11-13 region. About 70% of cases occur due to a deletion on the paternal chromosome 15, and about 25% of cases occur due to uniparental disomy, where the patient inherits both copies of chromosome 15 from the mother. This results in the silencing of the normally active paternal genes in this region.

Option A: Heteroplasmy, refers to a condition in which a cell contains both normal and mutated mitochondrial DNA, which is not the case in Prader-Willi syndrome.

Option C: Silencing in the imprinting region, while it plays a role in Prader-Willi syndrome, is not the primary mechanism. In Prader-Willi syndrome, the paternal genes in the 15q11-13 region are typically silenced, but this is a secondary effect of either a chromosomal deletion or uniparental disomy.

Option D: Anticipation, is a phenomenon that occurs in some genetic disorders where the symptoms become more severe or appear at an earlier age as the disorder is passed on to the next generation. This phenomenon is seen in diseases like Huntington's disease and myotonic dystrophy, but not in Prader-Willi syndrome.

Option E: Incomplete penetrance, is a phenomenon where not all individuals who inherit a disease-causing mutation develop the disease. This is not the case in Prader-Willi syndrome, as individuals who inherit the chromosomal abnormality will display symptoms of the disease."
5228,"This patient's presentation of abdominal pain, bloating, copious diarrhea, and a lingering cough is suggestive of an infection with Giardia lamblia. Giardiasis is often associated with the ingestion of contaminated water in the wilderness and is the most common intestinal parasite in the United States. Infection can cause a spectrum of symptoms, from asymptomatic cyst passage to severe malabsorptive diarrhea. Classic findings include bloating, flatulence, foul-smelling diarrhea (caused by impaired fat absorption), and, less commonly, weight loss. Chronic infection can lead to lactose intolerance. Coughing may occur due to small bowel content reflux into the upper GI tract. Transmission of giardiasis occurs via ingestion of cysts in fecally contaminated water or food, or from person to person.

5233,"The most appropriate next step in management is 'C': Administer IV fluid bolus.

This patient has prerenal azotemia, the most common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients. Prerenal azotemia is caused by decreased renal perfusion due to volume depletion (eg, vomiting, diarrhea, hemorrhage, burns) or decreased effective arterial blood volume (eg, heart failure, cirrhosis, sepsis). Clinically, it manifests as elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and BUN:creatinine ratio (>20:1), as well as oliguria. Most patients who undergo surgery, including laparoscopic procedures, have a period of decreased oral intake and are at risk of intravascular volume depletion. The kidney responds to decreased perfusion by reabsorbing more water and salt, which can lead to decreased urinary output. Treatment is aimed at improving renal perfusion by administering IV fluids.

Option 'A': Obtaining urinalysis could help to detect intrinsic renal disease (eg, acute tubular necrosis, glomerulonephritis), but there is no evidence to suggest this in the patient.

Option 'B': Evaluating the urinary catheter for obstruction could be considered if the patient had a sudden inability to void or had bladder distension, but the patient has neither.

Option 'D': Bilateral renal ultrasonography is appropriate if there is concern for postrenal AKI due to urinary obstruction (eg, stones, benign prostatic hyperplasia, malignancy). This patient has no symptoms of obstruction.

Option 'E': Emergent hemodialysis is only necessary in life-threatening situations (eg, severe hyperkalemia, volume overload with pulmonary edema, severe acidemia, uremic symptoms).

The patient has an indwelling urinary catheter in place, draining minimal urine over the last few hours. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Option: {'A': 'Obtain urinalysis', 'B': 'Evaluate urinary catheter for obstruction', 'C': 'Administer IV fluid bolus', 'D': 'Obtain bilateral renal ultrasonography', 'E': 'Initiate emergent hemodialysis'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient developed oliguria (urine output <0.5 mL/kg/h) and acute kidney injury (AKI) in the postoperative period, as evidenced by elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine. Serum potassium and CO2 are both within normal limits. The most common cause of AKI in hospitalized patients is pre-renal azotemia due to decreased renal perfusion. Common perioperative contributors to decreased renal perfusion include blood loss/hypovolemia, low cardiac output, and use of vasoactive medications. This patient's history of minimal urine output despite an indwelling urinary catheter suggests a decrease in renal perfusion rather than post-renal obstruction.

Thus, the most appropriate next step is fluid resuscitation, typically with IV isotonic crystalloid (eg, 0.9% saline) (Choice C). Fluid boluses increase renal perfusion and can often reverse prerenal AKI if given promptly. Other diagnostic measures may be pursued if there is no response to initial fluid resuscitation.

Obtaining a urinalysis (Choice A) is often done in the workup of AKI to evaluate for intrinsic renal disease. However, in a postoperative patient with oliguria, prerenal azotemia is by far the most likely cause. Evaluating the urinary catheter for obstruction (Choice B) is unlikely to be of benefit as the patient's AKI and oliguria are more likely due to decreased renal perfusion. Obtaining renal ultrasonography (Choice D) is typically done to assess for postrenal causes of AKI (eg, stones, tumors), which this patient's presentation does not suggest. Initiation of emergent hemodialysis (Choice E) is not necessary at this point as there are no emergent indications (ie, ""AEIOU"": Acidosis, Electrolyte abnormalities, Intoxications, Overload of fluid, Uremic symptoms)."

The peripheral blood film is likely demonstrating microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) characterized by schistocytes, evidence of end-organ damage secondary to malignant hypertension. Malignant hypertension (ie, hypertensive emergency) is severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure >180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure >120 mm Hg) associated with end-organ damage, including kidney injury, encephalopathy, cardiac ischemia, and retinal hemorrhages.

Treatment of a hypertensive emergency requires rapid reduction of blood pressure by 25% over the first hour (Options A and B). Nitroprusside is a direct arterial and venous vasodilator that has an immediate onset of action and short half-life, making it suitable for hypertensive emergencies. However, its use is limited due to the risk of cyanide toxicity (eg, altered mental status, abdominal pain, lactic acidosis). 

Labetalol (option B) is a combined alpha- and beta-antagonist with predominantly beta-blocking effects that result in decreased systemic vascular resistance and a small reduction in heart rate. It has a rapid onset of action (5-10 minutes) and is a preferred agent, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease or aortic dissection, due to decreased myocardial oxygen demand. As there is no mention of these conditions in this patient, labetalol would be the first choice for treatment.

Option C, dialysis, would not be the first choice for treatment because it would not address the patient's immediate hypertensive emergency.

Option E, renal transplantation, is not indicated in acute renal failure secondary to malignant hypertension."
5240,"The patient's presentation is consistent with cardiogenic shock, a state of tissue hypoperfusion due to decreased cardiac output despite high preload (as reflected by an increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure). Acute myocardial infarction (I) is the most common cause of cardiogenic shock, often resulting from extensive left ventricular infarction. Severe valvular stenosis (IV), such as aortic stenosis, can also lead to a marked decrease in cardiac output. Pulmonary embolism (V) can cause an abrupt increase in right ventricular afterload, leading to right ventricular failure and decreased left ventricular preload; if large enough, it can cause obstructive shock with features that resemble cardiogenic shock. 

Atrial fibrillation (II) may decrease cardiac output due to loss of atrial kick, but it is unlikely to cause cardiogenic shock except in patients with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction or rate-related impairment of left ventricular filling. Hemorrhage (III) and sepsis (VI) cause hypotension due to decreased systemic vascular resistance (leading to distributive shock) and/or decreased circulating volume (leading to hypovolemic shock), not decreased cardiac output.

I. Acute myocardial infarction: This is the most common cause of cardiogenic shock. Acute blockage of the coronary arteries leads to myocardial necrosis and loss of contractile function, decreasing cardiac output.

IV. Valvular stenosis: Severe valve stenosis (e.g., aortic stenosis) can lead to decreased forward flow and cardiac output, resulting in cardiogenic shock.

V. Pulmonary embolism: A massive pulmonary embolism can cause acute right heart failure and cardiogenic shock due to the sudden increase in pulmonary vascular resistance.

5241,"The patient's severe unilateral eye pain, red eye, nonreactive mid-dilated pupil, and hard eye on palpation are suggestive of acute angle-closure glaucoma. This condition occurs due to a sudden increase in intraocular pressure when the outflow of aqueous humor is blocked. The first-line treatment is to lower the intraocular pressure with medications, including topical beta-blockers (eg, timolol), alpha agonists (eg, apraclonidine), and oral or IV carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (eg, acetazolamide), while definitive treatment with laser or surgical peripheral iridotomy is arranged. Pilocarpine, a muscarinic agonist, is used as an immediate treatment to rapidly narrow the pupil and pull the iris away from the trabecular meshwork, thereby facilitating aqueous outflow. 

Topical epinephrine (option C), a nonselective adrenergic agonist, is contraindicated in acute angle-closure glaucoma. Although its use can increase uveoscleral outflow and reduce the production of aqueous humor, it also has an indirect mydriatic effect. This effect is mediated by stimulation of nonpigmented epithelial cells in the ciliary body to release prostaglandins, which can cause further pupillary dilation and potentially worsen the angle closure.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's sudden-onset severe unilateral ocular pain, red eye, mid-dilated nonreactive pupil, hard eyeball on palpation, nausea, and vomiting are classic for acute angle-closure glaucoma. Acute angle-closure glaucoma is an emergency and can lead to permanent vision loss if not treated promptly. It is especially common in farsighted patients and in those of Asian descent, who often have anatomically narrow anterior chamber angles. The treatment of acute angle-closure glaucoma involves decreasing the production of aqueous humor with medications like topical beta-blockers (e.g., timolol), alpha agonists (e.g., apraclonidine), and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., oral acetazolamide). Hyperosmotic agents (e.g., mannitol) can also be used to decrease vitreous volume and lower intraocular pressure. After the pressure is controlled, definitive treatment (e.g., laser peripheral iridotomy) is necessary to prevent recurrence.

Topical pilocarpine, a muscarinic agonist, is contraindicated in this case (Choice A). Although it can increase the outflow of aqueous humor by contracting the ciliary muscle and pulling open the trabecular meshwork, its use is limited due to its side effects and contraindications. In acute angle-closure glaucoma, the use of pilocarpine is relatively contraindicated in the initial phase of therapy because the drug can paradoxically further narrow the angle by causing constriction of the already ischemic iris sphincter muscle. 

The other answers are not contraindicated in this case: topical timolol (Choice B) is a beta blocker that decreases aqueous humor production; topical epinephrine (Choice C) decreases production and increases the outflow of aqueous humor; topical apraclonidine (Choice D) is an alpha agonist that decreases aqueous humor production; and oral acetazolamide (Choice E) is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that decreases aqueous humor production."
5244,"The correct answer is E. 'A 7-year-old boy with an 11-mm muscular defect and severe pulmonary vascular disease non-responsive to pulmonary vasodilators.'

This patient is likely to have a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) that has led to irreversible pulmonary hypertension, also known as Eisenmenger syndrome. This is indicated by the severe pulmonary vascular disease non-responsive to pulmonary vasodilators. The large size of the VSD (11-mm) allows for a large left-to-right shunt, which over time has led to increased pressure and resistance in the pulmonary vasculature.

Ventricular septal defects are the most common congenital heart defect. Small VSDs (less than 5 mm) often close spontaneously and do not typically cause symptoms. Larger VSDs (greater than 5 mm) are less likely to close spontaneously and can cause complications if left untreated.

Option A is wrong because a 4-month-old with a 12-mm muscular VSD but no symptoms of heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, or growth failure would be monitored closely but not necessarily operated on immediately. 

Option B is wrong because an 11-month-old with a 6-mm membranous VSD but no symptoms of heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, or growth failure would also be monitored closely but not necessarily operated on immediately.

Option C is incorrect because a 2-mm supracristal VSD in a 2-year-old is very small and unlikely to cause significant symptoms or complications.

Option D is wrong because a 2-mm membranous VSD in a 5-year-old is also very small and the Qp:Qs ratio of less than 2:1 indicates that the shunt is small, meaning the blood flow from the left to right ventricle is not significant.

Congenital heart defects, like ventricular septal defects, are typically managed conservatively if the patient is asymptomatic and the defect is small. Over time, a small defect may close spontaneously. The indication for surgical intervention includes presence of symptoms such as heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, failure to thrive or a large defect that's unlikely to close on its own. 

Choice E describes a 7-year-old boy with an 11-mm muscular defect and severe pulmonary vascular disease non-responsive to vasodilators, which represents a case of Eisenmenger syndrome. Eisenmenger syndrome is a severe form of pulmonary hypertension that results from long-standing left-to-right cardiac shunting (such as a large ventricular septal defect). Over time, increased pulmonary blood flow leads to vascular remodeling, pulmonary hypertension, and eventual reversal of the shunt. Manifestations include cyanosis, clubbing, and polycythemia. Because patients with Eisenmenger syndrome have ""fixed"" pulmonary hypertension (ie, not responsive to medications), they usually are not candidates for corrective cardiac surgery due to the high risk of perioperative mortality.

While other patients also have notable defects, none of them present with complications like heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, or growth failure, which could warrant surgical intervention. The 4-month-old infant in option A and the 11-month-old infant in option B, despite having larger defects, are not exhibiting symptoms that would necessitate surgery. The 2-year-old boy in option C and the 5-year-old girl in option D both have small defects and are not displaying symptomology that would require surgical intervention, making watchful waiting a more appropriate approach."

5273,"The correct answer is 'D': Lens. 

The lens of the eye and the seminal vesicles are the two primary sites of the polyol pathway, which is one of the minor pathways of glucose metabolism. The first step of this pathway is the conversion of glucose to sorbitol by the enzyme aldose reductase. Sorbitol is then converted to fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase. Thus, in the presence of increased extracellular glucose (as in diabetes mellitus), intracellular glucose increases, leading to increased flux through the polyol pathway and resultant accumulation of sorbitol and fructose. 

Long-term, hyperglycemia-induced sorbitol accumulation is osmotically active, drawing water into cells and leading to osmotic damage. This process is thought to contribute to certain complications of diabetes, including cataract formation in the lens and peripheral neuropathy.

As for the other options: The ovary ('A'), kidney ('B'), myelin sheath ('C'), and retina ('E') do not significantly utilize the polyol pathway, and therefore, their intracellular fructose concentrations would not be expected to increase significantly with increased extracellular glucose. The retina does, however, suffer damage in diabetes due to other mechanisms, mainly due to damage to the blood vessels that supply the retina.

The lens of the eye has an unusual metabolic pathway for glucose known as the sorbitol pathway. In this pathway, glucose is first converted to sorbitol by the enzyme aldose reductase. Sorbitol is then converted to fructose by the enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase. This pathway is particularly active in the lens, and also in the nerves, retina, and kidneys. However, the lens is most notable for accumulating sorbitol and fructose when glucose levels are high - such as in uncontrolled diabetes. This can contribute to the development of diabetic cataracts.

The other tissue options (ovary, kidney, myelin sheath, retina) do not have the same propensity for accumulating fructose via the sorbitol pathway. The kidney does use the sorbitol pathway, but not to the same extent as the lens. The ovary, myelin sheath, and retina do not use the sorbitol pathway as a significant part of their glucose metabolism."

5313,"The correct answer is C. Staphylococcus epidermidis.

This patient's joint pain, fever, erythema, and tenderness at the surgical site suggest a prosthetic joint infection. These infections often occur as a result of intraoperative inoculation of bacteria. The most common organisms implicated are coagulase-negative staphylococci (eg, Staphylococcus epidermidis), which are a part of the normal skin flora. They form a biofilm on the surface of the implanted material, which protects them from the host immune response and antimicrobial agents. S. epidermidis is often methicillin-resistant, which is why the organism in this patient is resistant to nafcillin, a penicillinase-resistant penicillin used to treat methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).

Option A: Streptococcus viridans is a common cause of subacute bacterial endocarditis, especially in patients with preexisting valvular disease, but it is not typically associated with skin and soft tissue infections.

SIADH is characterized by excessive release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) resulting in water retention and hyponatremia.

The most common causes of SIADH include malignancy, medications, CNS disorders, pulmonary disorders, and postoperative state. Small cell lung cancer (option 'A') is the most common malignancy associated with SIADH, but the onset of hyponatremia in SIADH due to malignancy is usually gradual and would not explain the acute change in mental status.

This patient's lethargy, confusion, and laboratory results are consistent with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), which is characterized by hyponatremia, hypo-osmolality, and urine that is inappropriately concentrated with respect to serum osmolality. This syndrome is caused by excessive release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), either from the posterior pituitary gland or from another source. Lithium is known to cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus by impairing the kidney's response to ADH. However, in some cases, it can cause syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH), particularly in elderly patients. In addition to lithium, the small cell lung cancer can also cause SIADH by ectopic production of ADH. But in this case, the patient's cancer was under control with chemotherapy, making it less likely to be the cause.

Option A: Carcinoma - While small cell lung cancer can cause SIADH, it is less likely in this case because the patient's cancer was being controlled with chemotherapy.

Option B: Bupropion - Bupropion is an antidepressant, and it is not typically associated with SIADH.

Option C: Psychogenic polydipsia - This refers to excessive water drinking that can lead to hyponatremia, but it is usually seen in psychiatric patients with schizophrenia, not bipolar disorder. Moreover, these patients typically have low urine osmolality due to suppression of ADH, which is not the case here. 

Option D: Infection - While infections can sometimes trigger SIADH, there's no indication of infection in this patient's clinical presentation or laboratory results.

The clinical scenario describes a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presents with an acute exacerbation characterized by increased sputum production and worsening dyspnea. Patients with COPD are at increased risk for respiratory infections due to impaired mucociliary clearance, and these infections can cause acute exacerbations.

Nitroglycerin acts primarily on the smooth muscle cells in veins and arteries, but its most beneficial effect in relieving angina is its action on the coronary arteries that supply the cardiac muscle.

Nitroglycerin relaxes the smooth muscle in the walls of the coronary arteries, causing them to dilate. This dilation increases blood flow to the cardiac muscle, thereby delivering more oxygen to the heart cells. This helps alleviate the chest pain associated with angina, which is typically caused by a reduced blood flow to the heart muscle.

The prevalence of Lyme disease in the area is among the highest in the country. How would the sensitivity and specificity of this new test change if it were performed on a patient in Texas, an area with a very low prevalence of Lyme disease?
Option: {'A': 'A', 'B': 'B', 'C': 'C', 'D': 'D', 'E': 'E'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The sensitivity and specificity of a test, in this case for Lyme disease, are inherent properties of the test and do not change based on the population in which the test is used. Therefore, if the test were to be used in Texas, an area with a low prevalence of Lyme disease, its sensitivity and specificity would remain the same as when it was used in Pennsylvania, an area with a high prevalence of Lyme disease. Therefore, the answer is 'E'.

To understand why, let's define sensitivity and specificity:

- Sensitivity measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified as such (e.g., the percentage of sick people who are correctly identified as having the condition). It is a measure of how well the test correctly identifies those WITH the disease.

- Specificity, on the other hand, measures the proportion of negatives that are correctly identified (e.g., the percentage of healthy people who are correctly identified as not having the condition). It is a measure of how well the test correctly identifies those WITHOUT the disease.

These characteristics of a test do not depend on the prevalence of the disease in the population being tested. They are inherent to the test itself. However, the predictive values (positive and negative) DO depend on the prevalence of the disease. With a low prevalence, the positive predictive value (PPV) decreases and the negative predictive value (NPV) increases. This is because there are fewer true positive results and more true negative results.

Therefore, in a low-prevalence setting like Texas, the test would yield more false positives and fewer false negatives, reducing its overall utility despite having the same sensitivity and specificity."

The pain in PAD is often described as a cramp, ache, fatigue, or feeling of heaviness.

Computerized tomography myelography (option B), electromyography (option C), and magnetic resonance imaging (option D) are used to evaluate nerve and spinal cord pathology, which is not suggested by this patient's symptoms and examination findings. His symptoms are worsened by exertion (walking downhill), which is not characteristic of neurologic claudication (eg, lumbar spinal stenosis, nerve root impingement). Neurologic claudication is typically relieved by lumbar flexion (eg, sitting, biking, leaning forward on a shopping cart).
Radiography (option E) would not help diagnose PAD, spinal stenosis, or nerve root impingement. It might show evidence of osteoarthritis or fracture but would not be the best next step for this patient."

This patient's trismus (inability to open mouth) and history of a penetrating wound suggest a tetanus infection. Tetanus is a life-threatening but preventable illness caused by the anaerobic gram-positive bacillus Clostridium tetani. Spores of C. tetani are present in soil and can contaminate wounds, particularly deep puncture wounds or wounds contaminated with dirt or feces. After the spores germinate, the bacterium produces an exotoxin that inhibits release of inhibitory neurotransmitters (Î³-aminobutyric acid and glycine) in the central nervous system, leading to unopposed muscle contraction and spasm. Clinical features of tetanus include trismus (lockjaw), risus sardonicus (sardonic smile due to facial spasm), and opisthotonos (severe muscle spasm leading to arching of the back). 

This patient had a penetrating wound and did not receive appropriate prophylaxis at the time of injury. Furthermore, his last tetanus vaccination was more than 10 years ago. Therefore, he is at risk for tetanus, and his lockjaw symptom is highly concerning for this diagnosis. He should receive a dose of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine (eg, tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis [Tdap], option A) and tetanus immune globulin. 

Option B, Td, is incorrect because it is a tetanus and diphtheria vaccine, but does not include pertussis component which is recommended for adults who have not previously received it. 

Option C is incorrect because patient needs immediate intervention, not just wound care and antibiotics. 

Option D, Tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG), is incorrect because it is used for passive immunization in unimmunized individuals or individuals with uncertain immunization status. This patient has been immunized but his last dose was more than 10 years ago.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is A: Tdap

This patientÃ¢â?¬â?¢s inability to open his mouth (trismus) suggests tetanus, a bacterial infection caused by Clostridium tetani. The bacteria produce a toxin that blocks inhibitory neurotransmitters, causing muscle stiffness and spasms. The most common early symptom is lockjaw (trismus). Patients may also have facial spasms (risus sardonicus), neck stiffness, difficulty swallowing, and rigidity of abdominal muscles. Severe cases can cause generalized spasms and autonomic instability. 

The bacteria are found in soil, dust, and animal feces and usually enter the body through a wound, especially a deep puncture wound. In this patient, the bacteria likely entered through the cut on his finger. 

The primary series of tetanus vaccine is usually given in childhood. Adults should receive a booster dose every 10 years. If the patient has a tetanus-prone wound (eg, deep wound, puncture wound, wound contaminated with dirt/feces/saliva, wound resulting from an explosion or crush injury, wound with necrotic tissue) and their booster was >5 years ago, they should receive Tdap or Td, depending on their vaccination history. If the patient has a non-tetanus-prone wound, they should receive Tdap or Td if their booster was >10 years ago. 

This patient should be given Tdap (Option A) to provide immediate passive immunity and to update his booster. He should also receive metronidazole or penicillin to kill the bacteria, and wound care to remove any bacteria.

Option B is incorrect. Td is a tetanus and diphtheria vaccine, but it does not contain the pertussis component. This patient should receive Tdap to provide protection against pertussis as well, especially since he has not received a booster in >10 years.

Option C is incorrect. This patient needs further treatment for his tetanus infection. Simply providing wound care and starting metronidazole is not enough.

Option D is incorrect. Tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) is indicated in unvaccinated individuals or in those with an uncertain vaccination history. This patient has a known vaccination history and has been previously immunized, so TIG is not necessary.

Option E is incorrect. DTaP is a pediatric vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. It is not used in adults."
5378,"The correct answer is 'C: Anti-Hu'.

The patient's history of encephalomyelitis, ataxia, and nystagmus is suggestive of paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS), which are remote effects of cancer that are not caused by the tumor's invasion of normal tissues or by metastasis. PNS can affect any part of the nervous system, and symptoms typically precede the diagnosis of cancer. The patient's new diagnosis of small cell lung cancer, which is commonly associated with anti-Hu antibodies, further supports this likelihood. Anti-Hu antibodies are often associated with a variety of PNS, including subacute sensory neuronopathy, limbic encephalitis, cerebellar degeneration, and others. Optic neuritis and uveitis, which may be present in patients with anti-Hu syndrome, are likely responsible for the patient's loss of vision.

This patient's encephalomyelitis, ataxia, nystagmus, and optic neuritis/uveitis suggest paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes, which are remote effects of cancer not attributed to direct invasion, metastasis, or secretion of hormones by the tumor. They are thought to be mediated by an immune response against shared antigens between the tumor and the nervous system. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most common malignancy associated with paraneoplastic syndromes. Anti-Hu antibodies are associated with encephalomyelitis and sensory neuronopathy in patients with SCLC.

5380,"The patient's elevated fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1C concentration indicate chronic hyperglycemia, which is the primary defect in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, the physician's conclusion that the patient's condition can likely be managed with diet alone and that she is not at significantly increased risk of micro- or macrovascular complications is most consistent with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) (option E). MODY is a heterogenous group of monogenic disorders characterized by non-insulin-dependent diabetes that usually develops in adolescence or early adulthood.

Her relatively low serum insulin concentration after glucose administration suggests a disorder of insulin secretion rather than insulin resistance. Also, the patient's young age, normal BMI, lack of physical examination abnormalities, and good prognosis with dietary management alone are all features consistent with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). MODY is a group of monogenic disorders characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, onset typically before age 25, absence of beta-cell autoimmunity (as in type 1 diabetes), and preservation of insulin secretory capacity (suggesting absence of significant insulin resistance as in type 2 diabetes).

5382,"Unfortunately, without seeing the actual ECG, it's impossible to provide an accurate answer. The ECG would give important information about the nature of her irregular pulse - whether it's due to an arrhythmia or something else. 

However, given the information provided, we can make some educated guesses. The patient is relatively young, healthy, has an irregular pulse, and experiences occasional palpitations and dizziness. These symptoms could suggest paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, a type of heart rhythm disorder that can cause these symptoms. 

Option A: Reassurance. This is not the right answer because even though she's feeling well, she has had symptoms that could indicate a serious condition. 

Option B: Event recorder implantation. This might be an option if we strongly suspect an intermittent arrhythmia that isn't captured by standard ECG. However, it's usually not the first step in management.

Option C: Stress echocardiography. This is usually done if we suspect a structural heart disease or coronary artery disease, which is less likely in this patient due to her age and lack of risk factors.

An event recorder is a device that the patient activates when they feel symptoms (like dizziness and palpitations). It's particularly useful in patients having episodic symptoms with normal ECGs, as it can allow for a definitive diagnosis by correlating symptoms with ECG findings.

Option A (Reassurance) could be considered if the ECG was normal and the symptoms were not concerning for a cardiac etiology, but given the irregular pulse, it's important to investigate further.

5383,"The most probable cause of this patient's condition is 'C': Embolized clot. The patient's presentation of unilateral lower extremity swelling, loss of sensation, diminished pulses, and pain on passive stretch is concerning for acute arterial occlusion, which is usually due to an embolized clot. Risk factors for arterial thrombosis include age, atherosclerosis, and hypercoagulable states. Additionally, intravenous drug use can also lead to embolization from right-sided infective endocarditis.

Option A: Cellulitis, a bacterial infection of the skin and underlying tissue, would typically present with local signs of inflammation like redness, warmth, and tenderness, not such severe pain and swelling. 

Option C: An embolized clot would likely cause acute onset of pain and would not account for the sensory loss.

5386,"The patient's physical examination findings of a systolic ejection murmur best heard at the right 2nd intercostal space and bilaterally diminished and delayed carotid pulses are consistent with aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis can be the result of congenital bicuspid aortic valve, calcification of a trileaflet aortic valve in the elderly, or rheumatic fever. Given this patient's age, calcification of a trileaflet aortic valve is the most likely etiology. This degenerative process involves calcium deposition on the aortic valve, which can extend to the mitral annulus but does not typically involve the mitral leaflets. The most common symptoms of aortic stenosis include dyspnea, angina, and syncope, particularly with exertion, due to the heart's inability to overcome the increased afterload of the stenotic aortic valve.

Option E (Erectile dysfunction) would most likely be seen in association with this patient's condition.

Hematochezia from a UGI source is usually associated with hemodynamic instability, as in this patient, due to the rapid transit of blood through the intestines. Peptic ulcer disease is the most common cause of severe UGI bleeding, which is often due to H pylori infection or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use.

Upper endoscopy (Option C) is usually the initial diagnostic test of choice in patients with UGI bleeding as it can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. Endoscopic therapy (eg, injection of epinephrine, application of clips or bands, argon plasma coagulation) significantly reduces the risk of persistent and recurrent bleeding and the need for surgery. 

Colonoscopy (Option A) would be the initial diagnostic test in patients with lower GI bleeding (eg, hematochezia with hemodynamic stability, melena without upper endoscopic findings). 

Nasogastric lavage (Option B) can help determine whether the bleeding is from an UGI source (eg, bloody or ""coffee grounds""-appearing output) but it doesn't allow direct visualization or treatment of the bleeding site and could delay definitive diagnosis and treatment in a hemodynamically unstable patient. 

Mesenteric angiography (Option D) would be useful in identifying the source of brisk intestinal bleeding (>0.5 mL/min) when endoscopy is not diagnostic.

5403,"This patient's symptoms of fatigue, back pain, and dark urine following oxidative stress from aspirin ingestion, along with a blood smear showing inclusion bodies within erythrocytes, suggest a diagnosis of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. This X-linked disorder is particularly prevalent in people of African and Mediterranean descent and is a common cause of episodic hemolytic anemia. Oxidative stress causes the denaturation of hemoglobin, forming Heinz bodies. Heinz bodies are then removed by splenic macrophages, leading to the formation of bite cells. G6PD is a key enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway (also known as the hexose monophosphate shunt) and is essential for the production of NADPH. NADPH is necessary for the reduction of glutathione, which neutralizes reactive oxygen species.

Reduced glutathione acts as a major cellular antioxidant, preventing damage to hemoglobin within RBCs. Therefore, the correct answer is D (Glucose-6-phosphatase). 

Option 'A' (Pyruvate carboxylase) is wrong because this enzyme is involved in gluconeogenesis, not in nucleotide production. 
Option 'B' (Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I) is wrong because it is involved in the urea cycle, not in nucleotide production. 
Option 'C' (Enolase) is wrong because it is involved in the glycolytic pathway, not in nucleotide production.
Option 'E' (Transaldolase) is wrong as it is involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, but its deficiency doesn't result in acute hemolytic anemia. Transaldolase deficiency presents with liver disease, immunodeficiency, coagulopathy, and dysmorphic features, a very different presentation from the patient in the question."
5407,"The patient's presentation is most concerning for prostate cancer (Option D). The finding of a firm and nodular prostate in a 51-year-old man is suggestive of prostate cancer. This, along with the syncopal episode, may indicate the spread of cancer or other systemic effects. Prostate cancer often presents asymptomatically or with symptoms such as hematuria, erectile dysfunction, or lower urinary tract symptoms (e.g., weak stream, nocturia, frequency, urgency, hesitancy). It should also be noted that these symptoms are non-specific and can be seen in other prostatic diseases such as benign prostatic hyperplasia. 

Option A: Benign prostatic hyperplasia is unlikely as it often presents with lower urinary tract symptoms like frequency, urgency, and nocturia, and the prostate on examination is typically smooth and enlarged, not firm and nodular as in this case.

Option B: This is not a normal physical exam due to the findings of a firm and nodular prostate.

Option C: Prostate abscess often presents with symptoms of infection (e.g., fever, chills, perineal or low back pain) and is associated with acute bacterial prostatitis. This patient does not have any of these symptoms.

Option E: Prostatitis often presents with symptoms of infection and urinary symptoms, which this patient does not have. In addition, on examination, the prostate may be tender in prostatitis, which is not the case in this patient.

His age, the firm and nodular prostate on exam, and the absence of other symptoms such as pain, fever, or urinary symptoms (which could suggest infection or malignancy) are all indicative of BPH.

BPH is a noncancerous enlargement of the prostate gland commonly seen in men as they age. The condition can cause urinary symptoms such as difficulty initiating urination, weak urine flow, or frequent urination, especially at night. However, not all men with BPH will have symptoms.

Option 'B': Normal physical exam is incorrect as the patient has a firm and nodular prostate, which is not normal.

Option 'C': Prostate abscess is incorrect as this condition typically presents with fever, chills, perineal or lower abdominal pain, urinary frequency and urgency, nocturia, and possibly urinary retention. This patient has none of these symptoms.

Option 'D': Prostate cancer is incorrect as prostate cancer usually presents with a hard, asymmetrical prostate on digital rectal examination. This patient's prostate is firm and nodular, but not hard or asymmetrical. Additionally, prostate cancer is typically slow-growing and often does not cause symptoms until later in the disease process.

Option 'E': Prostatitis is incorrect as this condition typically presents with fever, chills, lower abdominal discomfort, perineal or back pain, urinary frequency and urgency, dysuria, and possibly urinary retention. This patient doesn't have these symptoms.

5413,"The correct answer is B: Lumbar puncture. 

This patient's presentation of altered mental status, fever, and a history of untreated HIV/AIDS with a CD4 count <200 cells/Î¼L is suggestive of HIV-associated meningitis. The most common causes of meningitis in HIV patients are Cryptococcus neoformans, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, bacterial pathogens (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis), and viral pathogens (eg, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus).

Lumbar puncture is the most appropriate initial diagnostic step in this patient to identify the cause of meningitis. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can provide definitive diagnosis by revealing characteristic findings (eg, cryptococcal antigen, acid-fast bacilli, bacterial or viral cultures) and guiding appropriate therapy.

Option A is incorrect because although monitoring of CD4 count and HIV viral load are important in managing HIV, they are not the priority in this acutely ill patient.

Option C and D, MRI brain with contrast and CT head without contrast, respectively, are imaging studies that could be done if there was a suspicion of mass effect symptoms such as focal neurological deficits, papilledema or severe headaches, which are not seen in this patient.

The initial diagnostic approach to such patients should involve non-contrast head CT to evaluate for mass effect or focal lesions that could cause herniation. This is particularly important prior to lumbar puncture (LP) given the risk of precipitating brain herniation in those with increased intracranial pressure. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform a non-contrast head CT (Choice D). 

Option A is incorrect because although rechecking CD4 count and HIV viral load can help assess the severity of the patient's HIV disease and response to therapy, it would not aide in the diagnosis and management of the patient's acute mental status changes.

Option B is incorrect as lumbar puncture is a useful diagnostic tool in the setting of suspected CNS infection. However, it is important first to get a head CT scan to rule out any mass effect, as lumbar puncture in this setting could precipitate brain herniation.

Option C is incorrect because while MRI brain with contrast has a higher sensitivity for intracranial pathology (eg, toxoplasmosis, lymphoma), it is not the initial study of choice in a patient with altered mental status due to the longer time required to perform the study and the patient's inability to cooperate.

Option E is incorrect because although a neurological exam with fundoscopy is a good initial step in assessment, given the patient's altered mental status and high suspicion for CNS infection or lymphoma, a head CT is the most appropriate next step. Fundoscopic examination is mainly used to detect conditions like papilledema, which is associated with increased intracranial pressure, and retinal abnormalities, which can be seen in conditions like CMV retinitis."
5418,"The correct answer is B. Sternocleidomastoid muscles. 

Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) often have progressive weakness of their diaphragm and intercostal muscles, which are the main muscles used for inspiration. When these muscles fail, accessory muscles are recruited to assist with breathing. The sternocleidomastoid muscles, which attach from the sternum and clavicle to the mastoid process of the temporal bone, are among the most important accessory muscles for inspiration. When the sternocleidomastoid muscles contract, they elevate the sternum and thereby increase the anteroposterior diameter of the thoracic cavity, which aids in inspiration.

Option A, External intercostal muscles, is incorrect because they are not the primary muscles of inspiration in this patient. Although they are used in normal breathing, they are likely to be significantly weakened in a patient with ALS.

Option C, Muscles of anterior abdominal wall, is incorrect because these muscles are primarily used for expiration, not inspiration.

Option D, Trapezius muscle, is incorrect because the trapezius muscle is not significantly involved in the mechanics of breathing.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is A: External intercostal muscles. This patient's respiratory distress, paradoxical inward movement of the abdomen during inspiration (abdominal paradox), and absent lower lung breath sounds are suggestive of diaphragmatic fatigue or dysfunction, a common finding in patients with neuromuscular conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. When the diaphragm, the main muscle of inspiration, is weak or fatigued, the intercostal muscles become the primary drivers of inspiration. 

Option B: Sternocleidomastoid muscles are accessory muscles of respiration and are recruited during conditions of respiratory distress, but they do not play as significant a role as the external intercostal muscles in normal inspiration.

Option C: Muscles of the anterior abdominal wall are primarily involved in forced expiration, not inspiration.

Option D: The trapezius muscle is a muscle of the upper back and neck, not involved in respiration.

5430,"The patient's chronic, pruritic, scaling rash on the scalp and feet is suggestive of a dermatophyte (tinea) infection. Dermatophyte infections are classified by the site of involvement: tinea capitis (scalp), tinea pedis (foot), tinea cruris (groin), and tinea corporis (body). The patient's itchiness at night is a characteristic symptom of dermatophyte infections. These infections are common among patients with limited access to regular hygiene, such as this homeless individual. 

The most accurate test for diagnosing a dermatophyte infection is a KOH preparation of skin scrapings (option C). Scrapings are placed on a slide with potassium hydroxide, which digests keratin and allows for visualization of fungal hyphae under a microscope.

Option A (Wood's lamp) is incorrect because a Wood's lamp is primarily used to visualize pigment changes in the skin and hair. It would not be useful in identifying a fungal infection.

Option B (Culture in Sabouraud liquid medium) could be used for fungal cultures, but it is not as rapid or accurate as a KOH preparation.

Option D (CBC and total serum IgE) is incorrect because a complete blood count (CBC) and total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels would not provide definitive evidence of a fungal infection.

The same dermatophytes that commonly cause tinea pedis can also cause tinea capitis, although this is less common in adults. The most accurate test for the diagnosis of tinea pedis and tinea capitis is a KOH preparation of scales scraped from the skin or hair follicles (option C). The KOH dissolves non-fungal cellular material and allows for visualization of the fungal hyphae under the microscope.

Lyme disease is endemic in the northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and north-central regions of the United States. The disease has three stages: early localized, early disseminated, and late. The early localized stage is characterized by erythema migrans, a skin rash that occurs at the site of the tick bite. The early disseminated stage can involve multiple systems, including the skin, nervous system, heart, and joints. Late Lyme disease, which occurs months to years after the initial infection, most commonly manifests as intermittent bouts of monoarthritis in large joints, particularly the knee.

5470,"The described symptoms and vital signs of this patient do not suggest an effect of his antihypertensive medication (Choice A), a hypertensive crisis (Choice B), or orthostatic hypotension (Choice C), as his blood pressure remains stable with changes in position. His symptoms of presyncope (lightheadedness and a feeling of faintness) are suggestive of a cardiovascular cause but his blood pressure is adequately controlled. Therefore, the cause of his presyncope is more likely related to a rhythm disturbance which is not explicitly described here but may be seen on ECG.

Left bundle branch block (LBBB) and right bundle branch block (RBBB) (Choices D and E) are both conditions that can cause bradycardia (low heart rate) and presyncope. However, without further information such as an ECG, it is difficult to definitively determine whether this patient has a bundle branch block. Moreover, bundle branch blocks themselves usually do not directly cause presyncope. They can be associated with underlying heart disease which might lead to presyncope, but the bundle branch block itself wouldn't be the direct cause of presyncope.

This leaves us without a clear answer based on the information provided. A follow up, such as an ECG, would be needed to further evaluate the cause of his presyncope.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The patient's symptoms appear to be consistent with orthostatic hypotension, making 'C' the most likely answer. Orthostatic hypotension is characterized by a drop in blood pressure when a person moves from a supine (lying down) to a standing position, often leading to symptoms such as lightheadedness or a feeling of fainting. 

Option 'A' (Captopril) could be a possible cause of hypotension, but the patient's blood pressure measurements don't indicate hypotension. Options 'B' (Hypertension), 'D' (Left bundle branch block), and 'E' (Right bundle branch block) can be ruled out because there is no evidence in the patient's symptoms or vital measurements to suggest these conditions. Hypertension often doesn't cause symptoms like lightheadedness or feeling faint. Left or right bundle branch block might cause cardiac symptoms, but there's no mention of an abnormal ECG in the question.

However, it's worth noting that the blood pressure drop in this case is not significant enough to definitively diagnose orthostatic hypotension, which typically involves a drop of at least 20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure or 10 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure within 3 minutes of standing. This might suggest that there's another underlying issue causing the patient's symptoms."
5471,"The best next step for the management of this patient's condition is 'D': Stenting. 

This patient's hypertension, abdominal bruit, and magnetic resonance angiogram findings are suggestive of renal artery stenosis (RAS), most likely due to fibromuscular dysplasia given her age and sex. RAS can lead to secondary hypertension through activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Uncontrolled hypertension, despite compliance with antihypertensive medications, and an abdominal bruit that lateralizes are clues to secondary causes of hypertension such as RAS. 

When angiography demonstrates a hemodynamically significant RAS (ie, >60% narrowing), revascularization via percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) with stent placement is indicated. Therefore, the answer is 'D': Stenting.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The patient's severe hypertension, bruit over the abdomen, and the image findings suggest renal artery stenosis (RAS). RAS is most commonly caused by atherosclerosis in older patients and by fibromuscular dysplasia in young women. It can lead to secondary hypertension by activating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, due to decreased blood flow to the kidneys. A bruit heard over the abdomen or flanks that lateralizes can also be a clue to the diagnosis of RAS. If RAS is suspected, the next step in management is to confirm the diagnosis with duplex ultrasonography, computed tomographic angiography, or magnetic resonance angiography. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, the next step in management depends on the severity of stenosis and the patient's symptoms. In patients with severe hypertension that is unresponsive to medical therapy or with bilateral RAS or RAS in a solitary functioning kidney, revascularization is recommended. This can be achieved with percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) with or without stent placement. Hence, in this case, the best answer would be 'D': Stenting.

Option: {'A': 'Polymerase chain reaction', 'B': 'Restriction enzyme digestion products', 'C': 'Gel electrophoresis', 'D': 'Pyrosequencing', 'E': 'DNA isolation and purification'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The answer is A: 'Polymerase chain reaction'

Huntington's disease is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive brain cell death leading to cognitive, psychiatric, and motor dysfunction. It is an autosomal dominant disease, meaning that only one copy of the defective gene inherited from a parent is needed to develop the disease. The defective gene responsible for Huntington's disease is the huntingtin gene (HTT), which has a region that codes for a repeated sequence of the amino acid glutamine. In people without Huntington's, this region repeats 10-35 times. In people with Huntington's disease, the region repeats 36-120 times.

To determine whether the siblings in question carry the mutant allele, a test is needed that can detect the number of repetitions in the HTT gene. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique used to amplify a specific DNA segment, making it the best choice for this purpose. Following PCR, further analysis such as gel electrophoresis can be done to visualize the amplified DNA and determine the number of repetitions.

Option B 'Restriction enzyme digestion products' involves cutting DNA at specific sites, it is not specific enough to detect the mutation in Huntington's disease.

Option C 'Gel electrophoresis' separates DNA fragments by size, but by itself it cannot amplify the specific DNA segment needed.

Option D 'Pyrosequencing' is a method used to sequence DNA, but it is not necessary for detecting the number of repetitions in the HTT gene.

Option E 'DNA isolation and purification' is a preliminary step in most molecular biology experiments and would be part of the process in preparing for PCR, but by itself it cannot detect the presence of a specific gene or mutation."

Option: {'A': 'Absent corneal reflex', 'B': 'Jaw deviation', 'C': 'Relative afferent pupillary defect', 'D': 'Hypoesthesia of the earlobe', 'E': 'Hemifacial anhidrosis'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's fever, headache, foul-smelling nasal discharge, and orbital cellulitis symptoms (eg, double vision, eye pain, eyelid swelling) suggest bacterial sinusitis complicated by orbital abscess. Sinusitis typically results from obstruction of the sinus ostia due to inflammation (eg, viral upper respiratory infection, allergies), leading to overgrowth of normal sinus flora (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis), and occasionally, anaerobes. If untreated, infection can spread to the orbit via ophthalmic veins or through thin bony walls separating the ethmoid sinuses from the orbit. Orbital cellulitis can cause ophthalmoplegia due to inflammation and subsequent abscess formation in the extraocular muscles. As abscesses increase in size, they can cause compression of the optic nerve, resulting in vision loss, which is an emergency and can be irreversible if not managed promptly.

Option A: Absent corneal reflex, is associated with damage to the trigeminal nerve (V) or facial nerve (VII). It's not seen in orbital cellulitis.
Option B: Jaw deviation, is seen in damage to the trigeminal nerve (V) or facial nerve (VII). It's not seen in orbital cellulitis.
Option C: Relative afferent pupillary defect, is seen in conditions affecting the optic nerve, such as optic neuritis or retinal detachment, not orbital cellulitis.
Option D: Hypoesthesia of the earlobe, is associated with damage to the facial nerve (VII). It's not seen in orbital cellulitis.
Option E: Hemifacial anhidrosis, is seen in Horner syndrome due to disruption of the sympathetic nerve supply to the face. It's not seen in orbital cellulitis.

Therefore, relative afferent pupillary defect (Option C) is the most likely finding to occur in this patient if left untreated."
5484,"This patient's severe and persistent vomiting, leading to weight loss >5% of her pre-pregnancy weight, suggests a diagnosis of hyperemesis gravidarum. Although the exact etiology is unknown, it is believed to be multifactorial and include factors such as increased human chorionic gonadotropin levels. It usually presents before 9 weeks of gestation and peaks at 12 weeks. Symptoms can include severe nausea, vomiting, food aversions, and dehydration, leading to complications such as weight loss, electrolyte abnormalities, and nutritional deficiencies.

The first step in management is to assess the patient's hydration status and determine the severity of illness. Patients with signs of dehydration (eg, tachycardia, orthostasis, decreased skin turgor, dry mucous membranes) or evidence of complications (eg, electrolyte abnormalities, ketonuria) require hospitalization for intravenous fluid resuscitation (Choice E) and correction of electrolyte imbalances. 

Choice A, obtaining a basic electrolyte panel, is important but not the initial step. It is performed in hospitalized patients to identify and treat complications such as hypokalemia or metabolic alkalosis.

Choice B, obtaining a beta hCG and pelvic ultrasound, is not necessary because this patient has a confirmed intrauterine pregnancy at 22 weeks of gestation.

Options C (begin treatment with vitamin B6) and D (begin treatment with metoclopramide) are valid treatment options for hyperemesis gravidarum, but not before the patient's acute dehydration is addressed.

5489,"The answer is A: Constipation.

This patient's inability to void despite a palpable bladder suggests urinary retention, which is a common complication of spinal anesthesia and opioids used for postoperative pain control. Both of these can inhibit the detrusor muscle, leading to overdistension of the bladder and temporary loss of the micturition reflex. Bethanechol, a muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonist, enhances detrusor muscle contraction and relaxes the internal sphincter of the bladder to facilitate urination. However, it can also cause adverse effects by increasing smooth muscle tone in other parts of the body. Specifically, by increasing colonic smooth muscle tone, bethanechol can lead to constipation (choice A).

Tachycardia (choice B) is unlikely because muscarinic agonists typically slow the heart rate by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system. Muscle spasms (choice C) are not typically associated with muscarinic agonist use. Diaphoresis (choice D) and mydriasis (choice E, pupillary dilation) are associated with sympathetic activity, which would be decreased with muscarinic agonist use.","stop","the answer is a: constipation.","A","D","USMLE question: A 57-year-old man has worsening suprapubic discomfort 36 hours after undergoing a hemorrhoidectomy under spinal anesthesia.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is A. 'Constipation'.

The patient is experiencing urinary retention secondary to spinal anesthesia, a common complication particularly in older males. Initial management involves bladder decompression with a Foley catheter, but he may also benefit from a medication such as bethanechol, a muscarinic agonist that increases detrusor muscle tone to help promote bladder emptying. Adverse effects of bethanechol result from excessive stimulation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors throughout the body and can include abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and excessive salivation, but not constipation. 

However, many drugs that increase the tone of smooth muscle can also increase the tone of the bowel, leading to constipation. So although bethanechol typically does not cause constipation, the question may be suggesting that a drug with a broader effect on smooth muscle was used.

Option B, Tachycardia, is incorrect. Muscarinic agonists like bethanechol cause bradycardia, not tachycardia. 

Option C, Muscle spasms, can be seen with skeletal muscle relaxants or stimulants but not typically with medications affecting smooth muscle.

Option D, Diaphoresis, or excessive sweating, is a side effect of many medications but is not typically associated with medications to increase bladder tone.

Option E, Mydriasis, or pupil dilation, is not typically a side effect of medications used to increase bladder tone. These medications typically cause miosis, or pupil constriction."
5519,"The correct answer is A. The Valsalva maneuver consists of four phases. Phase I is initiated by a forced exhalation against a closed glottis, leading to increased intrathoracic pressure and a transient increase in blood pressure. Phase II is characterized by a drop in blood pressure due to decreased venous return to the heart, leading to reflex tachycardia. Late in phase II, there is a compensatory increase in systemic vascular resistance mediated by increased sympathetic activity which maintains blood pressure. Phase III begins with release of the breath, leading to decreased intrathoracic pressure, a transient drop in blood pressure, and a transient increase in heart rate. Phase IV is characterized by an overshoot increase in blood pressure due to the sustained high systemic vascular resistance and a sudden increase in venous return. This increased blood pressure is sensed by the baroreceptors and leads to reflex bradycardia. Phases III and IV are mediated by the baroreceptor reflexes and require intact efferent parasympathetic responses.

Option B is incorrect because during late phase II, there is an increase in blood pressure due to increased systemic vascular resistance but heart rate remains elevated due to the initial drop in blood pressure early in phase II. Option C is incorrect because during early phase II, there is a decrease in blood pressure due to decreased venous return to the heart, leading to reflex tachycardia not bradycardia. Option D is incorrect because during phase I, the increased intrathoracic pressure leads to an increase, not a decrease, in blood pressure.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is A. Phases III and IV are mediated by baroreceptor reflexes that require intact efferent parasympathetic responses.

The Valsalva maneuver consists of four phases:

Phase I: The initial increase in blood pressure is due to forced expiration against a closed glottis, which increases intrathoracic pressure and results in an increase in blood pressure.

Phase II: It is divided into an early and a late phase. During the early phase II, the persistent increase in intrathoracic pressure decreases venous return resulting in a decrease in cardiac output and hence a decrease in blood pressure. As a compensatory response (baroreceptor reflex), heart rate increases. During late phase II, there is a further decrease in blood pressure and heart rate due to reduced venous return and cardiac output.

Phase III: This is when the patient stops straining, intrathoracic pressure drops, and there is a transient decrease in blood pressure.

Phase IV: As venous return and cardiac output suddenly increases, there is an overshoot of blood pressure. The increase in blood pressure suppresses the heart rate via baroreceptor reflex, resulting in bradycardia.

So, option B is incorrect as during late phase II, there is a decrease, not an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. 

Option C is incorrect as during early phase II, there is a decrease in blood pressure and an increase in heart rate, not a decrease.

5522,"The answer is A: QT interval prolongation.

The drug the physician prescribed is most likely a Phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor, such as Milrinone. These drugs work by inhibiting the enzyme phosphodiesterase 3, which is responsible for the degradation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). By inhibiting this enzyme, the drug increases the levels of cAMP which leads to increased contractility of the heart muscle (positive inotropic effect) and vasodilation (which decreases afterload). 

The most significant adverse effect of this class of drugs is QT interval prolongation, which can lead to torsades de pointes, a type of ventricular tachycardia.

Option B: Hyperkalemia is not a typical side effect of Phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitors. These drugs do not affect potassium levels in the body.

Option C: Hypotension could theoretically occur due to the vasodilatory effects of the drug, but this is generally well-managed with dosage adjustments and is not the most significant adverse effect.

This patient's renal biopsy findings (sclerosis in the capillary tufts and arterial hyalinosis) suggest diabetic nephropathy, a common complication of diabetes mellitus. The initial lesion of diabetic nephropathy is hypertrophy and hyperfunction of the glomeruli, followed by extracellular matrix accumulation in the mesangium (diffuse glomerulosclerosis). Over time, nodular glomerulosclerosis (ie, Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions) may develop. This nodular glomerulosclerosis is characterized by hyaline deposition in the mesangium that gives the glomeruli a nodular appearance on microscopy. The hyaline is likely derived from plasma proteins that have leaked across the damaged glomerular basement membrane. In addition, afferent and efferent arteriolar hyalinosis can be observed. The hyaline arteriolosclerosis is characterized by pink, hyaline material in the arteriolar walls. The arteriolar hyalinosis contributes to the progressive decline in renal function.

Option 'B' is Amyloidosis. This would most likely present with nephrotic syndrome, and the biopsy would show amorphous eosinophilic deposits.

However, in some cases, systemic symptoms such as high fever and hepatosplenomegaly can occur. These are suggestive of a more severe infection, and in such cases, treatment with azithromycin has been shown to lead to faster resolution of lymphadenopathy.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

Option 'A': 'Doxycycline + rifampin' - This is a treatment regimen typically used for brucellosis, not cat scratch disease.

Option 'B': 'Rifampin + azithromycin' - While these antibiotics are used in the treatment of many infections, they are not the first-line treatment for cat scratch disease.

Option 'C': 'No treatment is required' - While cat scratch disease is often self-limited, the presence of systemic symptoms like high fever and hepatosplenomegaly in this child warrant treatment.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This girl's history of a cat bite, lymphadenopathy (swelling in the axilla), and systemic symptoms (fever, hepatosplenomegaly) suggest the diagnosis of cat-scratch disease. Cat-scratch disease is caused by Bartonella henselae, a gram-negative rod, and it is a common cause of regional lymphadenopathy in children and adolescents. The disease usually begins with a papular lesion at the site of a cat scratch or bite, followed by the development of regional lymphadenopathy 1-3 weeks later. Systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, and weight loss can also occur. Enlargement of the spleen and liver may also be seen. The diagnosis is usually made clinically, but serologic testing can support the diagnosis.

The majority of patients with cat-scratch disease have a self-limited illness and do not require antibiotic therapy. Treatment is primarily supportive, and symptoms usually resolve within 2-4 months. However, in cases with systemic symptoms such as high fever and hepatosplenomegaly (like in this girl), antibiotic therapy with azithromycin has been shown to speed the resolution of symptoms (Option E).

The combination of doxycycline and rifampin (Option A) is not the first-line treatment for cat-scratch disease and is usually reserved for more severe infections like those caused by Bartonella bacilliformis. Similarly, the combination of rifampin and azithromycin (Option B) is not typically used for this condition.

Surgical excision (Option D) is not the primary treatment for this condition. It may be considered in cases where the lymphadenopathy does not resolve after several months or if it is causing significant symptoms, such as pain or cosmetic concerns.

No treatment (Option C) is not appropriate in this case because the girl is presenting with systemic symptoms, indicating a more severe infection. Treatment can help to alleviate these symptoms and speed up recovery."
5539,"This patient's presentation is consistent with acromegaly, which is caused by excessive production of growth hormone, most often by a pituitary adenoma. When it occurs after the closure of the epiphyseal growth plates, this excess growth hormone leads to the growth and thickening of soft tissues and bones in the hands, feet, and facial features (eg, increased ring or shoe size, protruding jaw, frontal bossing, wide nose, large lips, spacing of teeth). Systemic manifestations include hypertension, insulin resistance (leading to hyperglycemia, as seen in this patient), menstrual irregularities, and increased body hair. Cardiac involvement in acromegaly leads to a specific form of cardiomyopathy characterized by biventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, and, eventually, reduced cardiac output (choice E).

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's signs and symptoms (headaches, vision changes, acral enlargement) and lab findings (hyperglycemia) suggest acromegaly, a disorder caused by excessive growth hormone (GH) secretion, usually due to a pituitary adenoma. In addition to somatic effects (e.g., soft tissue swelling, skeletal growth), GH excess can lead to metabolic effects, such as insulin resistance (hence, the patient's hyperglycemia). Over time, untreated acromegaly can cause various complications, including cardiomyopathy, due to the direct effects of GH/insulin-like growth factor-1 on the heart and the indirect effects of systemic hypertension, which is common in patients with acromegaly. These patients also often have increased blood volume and cardiac output due to sodium and water retention stimulated by GH. Despite the increase in cardiac output, patients with acromegaly can develop diastolic dysfunction due to myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis.
Therefore, among the choices provided, 'Thickening of the coronary artery walls' (Option C) is the most likely sequela of this patient's condition. 

Option A: Deposition of mucopolysaccharides in the myocardium is seen in Hurler syndrome, a mucopolysaccharidosis.

Option B: Enhanced sympathetic activity is not directly associated with acromegaly, although it may result in some cases due to associated hypertension or heart disease.

Option D: Prolongation of the QT interval on ECG is seen with disorders that affect myocardial repolarization, such as congenital long QT syndrome, electrolyte disturbances, and certain drugs, but it is not typically associated with acromegaly.

Option E: Reduced cardiac output isn't typical in acromegaly where it is usually increased due to the effects of GH on sodium and water retention. However, eventually, cardiac output may decrease as heart failure develops."
5541,"Answer: E. Emergent surgery

The patientâ??s presentation is concerning for a traumatic injury to a large artery in the thigh, likely the femoral artery, given the location of the knife wound and the pulsatile nature of the bleeding. A pulsatile bleeding pattern is often a sign of arterial injury. In the setting of penetrating trauma with suspected vascular injury, the next best step in management is emergent surgical exploration, especially when hemodynamic instability is present or suspected. This allows for direct visualization and control of the bleeding. 

Other options are not the best next step in this scenario:

Option A and B: Imaging such as CT scan or radiographs might be helpful in trauma patients to identify the site or extent of injury, but they are not suitable in this case. When a patient is hemodynamically unstable or there is a high suspicion of life-threatening injury such as arterial damage, immediate surgical intervention takes precedence over imaging studies.

Option C: Coagulation studies and blood typing/crossmatch are necessary in trauma patients, especially if blood transfusion is anticipated. However, they do not address the immediate need for controlling the ongoing bleeding.

Option D: Tourniquet application can be useful to control bleeding in extremity injuries as a temporizing measure until definitive control can be achieved. However, in this scenario where the injury is in the proximal thigh near the inguinal ligament, a tourniquet would not be effective and could potentially worsen the injury. Also, the bleeding is currently controlled with direct pressure. The patient needs definitive surgical management of his vascular injury.

This patient most likely has a femoral artery injury, considering the proximity of the knife wound to the inguinal ligament and the pulsatile bleeding. In such a situation, emergent surgical intervention is the next best step to control the bleeding and repair the injury. 

A CT scan (option A) or radiograph (option B) of the lower extremities is not necessary as the physical exam has already indicated a probable arterial injury. Additionally, in a critical situation like this, there may not be enough time for imaging studies. 

Coagulation studies and blood typing/crossmatch (option C) could be useful for assessing the patient's clotting function and preparing for possible transfusion, but these should not delay the definitive treatment, which is surgery. 

A tourniquet (option D) can help control bleeding from a peripheral limb injury, but it may not be effective for an injury to the femoral artery, which is a large, central vessel. Furthermore, prolonged use of a tourniquet can cause ischemic injury to the limb. Therefore, a tourniquet is not the best option in this case."
5542,"This patient's confusion, altered level of consciousness, fluctuating mental status, and disorientation is consistent with delirium, which is common in the elderly, especially during hospitalization or following surgery. Delirium is often due to a medical condition, medication effect, or substance withdrawal. In this case, the patient's presentation could be secondary to alcohol withdrawal, given his daily whiskey consumption. Alcohol withdrawal can occur in those who chronically consume alcohol and then abruptly decrease their intake. Symptoms often start within 48-72 hours after the last drink and can include autonomic hyperactivity (eg, tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, diaphoresis), altered mental status (eg, confusion, agitation), and hand tremor. Severe cases can progress to hallucinations, seizures, and delirium tremens.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's fluctuating mental status changes, agitation, and inattentiveness in the setting of recent surgery are suggestive of delirium, a common condition in hospitalized elderly patients. Delirium is often multifactorial and can be triggered by a number of stressors (eg, hospitalization, surgery, medications, metabolic disturbances, infections). The patient's current medications, oxycodone (a narcotic) and ipratropium (an anticholinergic), can contribute to the development of delirium. Evaluation involves a thorough assessment for reversible causes; however, this patient's workup to date, including vital sign stability and normal laboratory results, does not suggest an obvious cause such as infection or metabolic abnormality. 

Among the options provided, the most appropriate next step is quiet reassurance and attempts at reorientation, along with discontinuation or decrease in doses of the medications potentially contributing to the delirium (eg, oxycodone).

5551,"This patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, steatorrhea (foul-smelling, greasy stools), and weight loss despite a good appetite are suggestive of chronic pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis is characterized by progressive inflammation, fibrosis, and loss of both exocrine and endocrine pancreatic tissue. Exocrine tissue loss leads to malabsorption of fat and the clinical syndrome of steatorrhea and weight loss. 

Endocrine tissue loss leads to diabetes mellitus, as is likely evident in this patient with a fasting glucose of 186 mg/dL (normal <100 mg/dL). The most common cause of chronic pancreatitis in Western countries is alcohol abuse. However, this patient's ultrasound findings of multiple round, echogenic foci within the gallbladder lumen with prominent posterior acoustic shadowing are consistent with cholelithiasis (gallstones), which can cause chronic pancreatitis due to obstruction of the pancreatic duct.

Glucagon (option B) is a hormone that is produced by the alpha cells of the pancreas. In a patient with chronic pancreatitis, the loss of pancreatic tissue would result in decreased, not increased, glucagon production.

Insulin (option D) is produced by the beta cells of the pancreas. Similar to glucagon, in a patient with chronic pancreatitis, the loss of pancreatic tissue would result in decreased, not increased, insulin production. 

Somatostatin (option A) is a hormone that inhibits the secretion of several other hormones such as insulin, glucagon, and growth hormone. It is produced by the delta cells of the pancreas. Again, in a patient with chronic pancreatitis, the loss of pancreatic tissue would result in decreased, not increased, somatostatin production.

Vasoactive intestinal peptide (option E) is a peptide hormone produced in the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas that stimulates the secretion of water and electrolytes from the pancreas and inhibits gastric acid secretion. In a patient with chronic pancreatitis, the loss of pancreatic tissue would result in decreased, not increased, VIP production.

Serotonin (option C) is not produced by the pancreas and would not be affected by chronic pancreatitis. It is primarily found in the gastrointestinal tract, platelets, and central nervous system.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, foul-smelling, greasy stools, and weight loss along with the finding of numerous echogenic foci in the gallbladder are suggestive of gallstone disease with accompanying malabsorption due to the inability to absorb fats. The most common type of gallstones in the United States are cholesterol stones, which can be caused by supersaturation of cholesterol in the bile, decreased phospholipids/bile acids, or gallbladder stasis. Normally, fats are broken down by pancreatic lipase into monoglycerides and free fatty acids that can be absorbed in the small intestine. However, for lipase to work, the fats need to be emulsified by bile acids, which are made from cholesterol. In the setting of gallstone disease, the flow of bile to the small intestine can be impaired, leading to malabsorption of fats. This can result in steatorrhea (foul-smelling, greasy stools) and weight loss. His elevated fasting serum glucose concentration could be due to pancreatic involvement (eg, chronic pancreatitis caused by gallstone obstruction of the common bile duct), resulting in decreased insulin production. So the answer is D: Insulin.

The other options are incorrect because they are not directly involved in the described pathology:

A: Somatostatin - a hormone that inhibits the release of many other hormones in the body, including insulin and glucagon. There is no reason to believe it would be increased in this patient.

B: Glucagon - a hormone that raises blood sugar levels by stimulating the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose. It is usually counterbalanced by insulin, so in the context of decreased insulin production, we might expect increased glucagon levels. However, the pathology described in the question is more directly related to insulin, making it a better answer.

C: Serotonin - a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood, appetite, and other functions. Not relevant to this patient's presentation.

E: Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) - a neuropeptide that has many functions, including promoting the release of intestinal enzymes and regulating smooth muscle activity. Not relevant to this patient's presentation."
5554,"The correct answer is E: 'Ocular abnormalities'.

Explanation: 
The baby has a cleft lip, which is a common birth defect seen in one out of every 700 births. Cleft lip is due to the failure of fusion of the maxillary and medial nasal processes (forming the primary palate). It's often associated with cleft palate. Cleft lip with or without cleft palate is often isolated but can be associated with many genetic syndromes. Non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate is thought to be multifactorial, with both genetic and environmental contributors. It's associated with an increased incidence of other malformations, such as congenital heart disease and ocular abnormalities (option E). 

Now, let's discuss why other options are incorrect:

A: 'Respiratory difficulty' - Cleft lip alone is not typically associated with respiratory difficulties. However, if the cleft was involving the palate, it could potentially cause feeding difficulties and possible aspiration, which could lead to respiratory issues. 

B: 'Down syndrome' - Down syndrome (trisomy 21) is usually identified by a specific pattern of physical and ultrasound findings, along with abnormal prenatal screening results (increased nuchal translucency, low PAPP-A, and high free Î²-hCG). 

C: 'Neural tube abnormalities' - Neural tube defects (anencephaly, spina bifida) are usually associated with elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels. This patient's MSAFP level is normal.

D: 'Trisomy 13' - Trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) is usually associated with severe intellectual disability and multiple malformations affecting the eyes, CNS, and polydactyly.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is E: Ocular abnormalities.

Cleft lip is a common birth defect that results from the failure of fusion of the primary palate (lip and premaxilla) around the 4th to 7th weeks of gestation. Isolated cleft lip or cleft lip and palate (CL/P) may occur as part of an underlying syndrome or as an isolated anomaly. Approximately 30% of CL/P cases are syndromic, and these patients may have additional anomalies, including cardiac, limb, and ocular abnormalities (e.g., microphthalmia, colobomas). Therefore, a fetus with a cleft lip may have an increased risk of ocular abnormalities.

Option A: Respiratory difficulty is more associated with prematurity or conditions like congenital diaphragmatic hernia or pulmonary hypoplasia. 

Option B: Down syndrome, is a chromosomal disorder associated with increased maternal age and characterized by intellectual disability, certain facial features such as upslanting palpebral fissures, a flat nasal bridge, and a protruding tongue, and medical problems such as congenital heart disease. But in this case, the screening tests for Down syndrome, including PAPP-A and free Ã?Â²-hCG, are within normal ranges, which makes Down syndrome unlikely.

Option C: Neural tube abnormalities would be associated with increased MSAFP, which is normal in this patient.

Option D: Trisomy 13, also known as Patau syndrome, is a severe chromosomal disorder associated with multiple malformations, including cleft lip or palate, but also typically includes central nervous system malformations, polydactyly, cardiac defects, and others. If Trisomy 13 was the case, the screening tests would probably not be normal like in this patient."

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's urinary and fecal incontinence, vision changes, and headaches that occur suddenly and randomly, particularly during emotionally stressful times, are suggestive of conversion disorder. Conversion disorder is a psychiatric condition in which patients present with physical symptoms that cannot be explained by an underlying medical condition, and are believed to be related to psychological stress or trauma. The physical findings are not intentionally produced or feigned, and represent a subconscious manifestation of the psychological stress. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is a psychological assessment for conversion disorder (Option E).

Option A (Psychological assessment for suicidal ideation) would be relevant if the patient displayed overt signs of depression, such as feeling hopeless, loss of interest in activities, sleep disturbances, appetite changes, or expressly communicated thoughts of death or suicide. 

Option B (MRI of the head) may be required in the future if organic causes for the symptoms need to be ruled out, particularly if the symptoms persist despite psychological intervention, but it is not the most appropriate initial step.

Option C (Cognitive behavioral therapy) could be beneficial as part of the treatment for conversion disorder, but assessment and diagnosis should precede treatment.

The liver biopsy finding of multinucleated giant cells with cytoplasmic inclusions and eosinophilic, needle-shaped structures arranged in a star-like pattern is consistent with the presence of a lupus erythematosus (LE) cell. The LE cell is a neutrophil or macrophage that has phagocytosed the nuclear material of another cell. This nuclear material is seen as a homogenous, round inclusion within the phagocyte.

Option A: Sarcoidosis is characterized by the presence of noncaseating granulomas, not the LE cells seen in this patient's liver biopsy.

5604,"This patient's fever, weight loss, hemoptysis, and cavitary lung disease suggest a diagnosis of tuberculosis, a common disease in patients who immigrate from endemic areas, such as Azerbaijan. It is often more severe in individuals with impaired immunity such as those with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. The first-line drugs used to treat tuberculosis include isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is also given with isoniazid to prevent the development of peripheral neuropathy. Isoniazid resistance can occur due to a mutation that decreases production of catalase-peroxidase (KatG), an enzyme that converts isoniazid to its active form. Therefore, the answer is E.

Option A is incorrect. Increased production of arabinosyl transferase is associated with resistance to ethambutol, which inhibits arabinosyl transferase and thereby cell wall synthesis.
Option B is incorrect. DNA gyrase is the target of fluoroquinolones, not anti-tuberculosis drugs.
Option C is incorrect. Pyrazinamide is a prodrug converted to its active form, pyrazinoic acid, by pyrazinamidase; however, resistance develops through mutation in pyrazinamidase, not through impaired conversion of the drug to pyrazinoic acid.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The answer is C: Impaired conversion to pyrazinoic acid.

The patient's symptoms, radiographic findings, and country of origin suggest a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). The drug most likely in question is isoniazid, a first-line antitubercular medication. Isoniazid is a prodrug that requires activation by the mycobacterial enzyme catalase-peroxidase (encoded by katG) to form the active metabolite isonicotinic acid. After being activated, isoniazid inhibits synthesis of mycolic acids, an essential component of the bacterial cell wall.

Resistance to isoniazid can occur via multiple mechanisms. The most common mechanism is through mutation in the katG gene coding for the catalase-peroxidase enzyme, leading to decreased production of this enzyme, which prevents activation of the drug. However, resistance can also develop through mutations in the inhA gene, leading to decreased affinity of the drug target for activation. Finally, resistance can develop through overexpression of the ahpC gene, which results in increased production of an alternate enzyme that can detoxify the isonicotinic acid.

Option A, increased production of arabinosyl transferase, would lead to resistance against ethambutol, another first-line antitubercular medication. Option B, changed amino acid composition of DNA gyrase, is associated with resistance against fluoroquinolones. Option D, mutation in genes encoding RNA polymerase, is associated with resistance against rifampin. Option E, decreased production of catalase-peroxidase, actually describes a mechanism of resistance against isoniazid, but it's not related to the metabolism of pyridoxine. Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is given along with isoniazid to prevent the development of peripheral neuropathy, a side effect of isoniazid therapy."

This patient's tremor that worsens with goal-directed activities (eg, finger-to-nose testing), improves with alcohol consumption, and is present at rest is most consistent with essential tremor (ET). ET is often familial and typically presents in middle-to-late adulthood. Propranolol, a nonselective beta-blocker, is first-line treatment for ET. It is not completely understood how propranolol ameliorates ET, but it is thought to involve blockage of peripheral beta-2 receptors, leading to decreased tremor amplitude. Primidone, an anticonvulsant, is another first-line treatment for ET but is often reserved for patients who cannot tolerate or do not respond to propranolol.

Alprazolam (option A) is a benzodiazepine that may be used in ET if first-line treatments are not effective or are contraindicated. However, due to risk of dependence and adverse effects (eg, sedation, cognitive impairment), it is not a first-line treatment.

Levodopa (option B) is used in the treatment of Parkinson disease, which this patient's symptoms do not support. Parkinsonian tremor is typically a rest tremor that improves with action, whereas this patient's tremor is worse with action.

Primidone (option C) is also used in the treatment of ET. However, propranolol is usually preferred as the initial therapy because primidone has a greater risk of adverse effects, including nausea, ataxia, and dizziness.

This patient's difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and regurgitation of undigested food particles, along with the physical examination and imaging findings of a mass in the neck that accumulates contrast during a barium swallow, are suggestive of a Zenker's diverticulum. Zenker's diverticulum is a pulsion pseudodiverticulum that arises from the posterior hypopharynx, usually at the level of the cricopharyngeal muscle (C5-C6). The cause is thought to be increased intrapharyngeal pressure (due to incoordination of swallowing) leading to herniation of the mucosa and submucosa through the Killian triangle, an area of muscular weakness between the inferior pharyngeal constrictor and the cricopharyngeus muscles. The fact that the mass becomes more prominent when the patient coughs is another hint towards Zenker's diverticulum, as the increased pressure can further distend the pouch. It is not a remnant of embryological structures (like the thyroglossal duct or second branchial cleft), as it is an acquired, not congenital, condition.

Option A ('Inadequate relaxation of lower esophageal sphincter') is incorrect because it would lead to achalasia, which is usually characterized by dysphagia to both solids and liquids, weight loss, and sometimes regurgitation of undigested food. The barium swallow would show a 'bird's beak' appearance, and the neck mass described in the question would not be present.

Option B ('Remnant of the embryological omphalomesenteric duct') would result in a Meckel's diverticulum, which is usually asymptomatic but can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, obstruction, or inflammation. It is not associated with a neck mass.

Option D ('Remnant of the thyroglossal duct') is incorrect because this would lead to a thyroglossal duct cyst, which is a midline neck mass that moves with swallowing or protrusion of the tongue, not the symptoms described in the question.

Option C ('Increased intrapharyngeal pressure') is a contributing factor to the development of Zenker's diverticulum but is not an answer choice that accurately describes the overall pathogenesis of the condition.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's presentation of bilateral breast pain, tenderness, firmness, and fullness with cracked nipples shortly after delivery is suggestive of lactational mastitis. This condition is often due to milk stasis leading to infection, most commonly with Staphylococcus aureus. Factors predisposing to milk stasis include poor latch, infrequent or ineffective feedings, and cracked nipples. Initial management of lactational mastitis includes frequent breastfeeding or pumping to empty the breast along with warm compresses or warm showers to facilitate milk flow. In addition, analgesia (eg, ibuprofen) may be used to relieve pain. If systemic signs of infection (eg, fever, myalgia, malaise) develop or if there is no improvement within 12-24 hours, antibiotic therapy (eg, dicloxacillin, cephalexin) should be initiated. 

Option A (Cold compresses and analgesia) is only partially correct, as it will help with pain and inflammation but will not help to empty the breasts and could potentially worsen the milk stasis.

Option B (Oral contraceptives) would not be beneficial in this setting. Contraceptives that contain estrogen can decrease milk supply and would not be helpful in treating lactational mastitis.

Option C (Mammography) is used for breast cancer screening and not typically used in the diagnosis or treatment of lactational mastitis.

Option E (Incision and drainage) is inappropriate. This intervention is used for breast abscesses, which typically occur if mastitis is not properly treated. The patient's symptoms do not suggest an abscess.

This question describes a child with hypoketotic hypoglycemia (low blood sugar without the presence of ketones), which is suggestive of a disorder in fatty acid oxidation. Fatty acid oxidation, which occurs in the mitochondria, is an important source of energy, particularly for the heart and skeletal muscle. During periods of fasting or increased energy demands, fatty acids are broken down and transported into the mitochondria by the carnitine shuttle. Once inside the mitochondria, they are converted to acetyl-CoA through beta-oxidation and used to produce energy. Defects in this process can lead to a buildup of fatty acids, leading to hypoglycemia and lack of ketone bodies (which are normally produced from acetyl-CoA in the liver and used as an alternative energy source during fasting). 

Ammonia is a product of protein metabolism, and elevated serum concentrations are seen in disorders of the urea cycle, not fatty acid oxidation. If this patient had high ammonia levels, it would suggest a different diagnosis, such as a urea cycle defect.

Regarding the other options:

A: Î²-hydroxybutyrate is a type of ketone body. In a disorder of fatty acid oxidation, you would expect low, not high, levels of ketone bodies.

B: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is an enzyme found in the liver and is a marker for liver injury. It is not directly related to fatty acid oxidation.

C: Uric acid is a breakdown product of purines and is not directly related to fatty acid oxidation.

E: Creatine kinase (CK) is an enzyme found in the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. Elevated levels can indicate muscle damage, but it is not directly related to fatty acid oxidation.","stop","the correct answer is d: 'ammonia'.","D","A","USMLE question: A 4-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because of fatigue and generalized weakness for 4 months.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is D. Ammonia.

This patient's presentation of hypoglycemia and weakness is suggestive of a metabolic disorder. The carnitine shuttle is responsible for transporting long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for Ã?Â²-oxidation, which is a major source of energy for the body during periods of fasting. Therefore, a defect in one of the enzymes of the carnitine shuttle (carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, carnitine palmitoyltransferase II, or carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase) would result in hypoglycemia and low energy, as seen in this patient.

However, an increased serum concentration of ammonia would suggest a urea cycle disorder rather than a defect in the carnitine shuttle. The urea cycle is responsible for the conversion of ammonia, a toxic byproduct of amino acid metabolism, into urea, which is then excreted in the urine. A defect in one of the enzymes of the urea cycle would result in an accumulation of ammonia, leading to symptoms such as lethargy, vomiting, cerebral edema, and eventually coma.

Option A: Ã?Â²-hydroxybutyrate is a type of ketone body. In a normal fasting state, the liver breaks down fatty acids into acetyl-CoA, which is then converted into ketone bodies, including Ã?Â²-hydroxybutyrate. However, in a carnitine shuttle defect, this process would be impaired, leading to low levels of ketone bodies.

Option B: Alanine aminotransferase is an enzyme involved in amino acid metabolism. Its levels would not be affected by a carnitine shuttle defect.

Option C: Uric acid is a byproduct of purine metabolism. Its levels would not be affected by a carnitine shuttle defect.

Option E: Creatine kinase is an enzyme found in skeletal muscle, brain, and heart tissue. Its levels can be elevated in conditions such as muscle damage or myocardial infarction, but it would not be affected by a carnitine shuttle defect."

5650,"The correct answer is C. Troponin T.

Troponin T and I are cardiac-specific proteins that are released into the bloodstream when myocardial necrosis occurs, such as in a myocardial infarction. They begin to rise 3 to 4 hours after the onset of symptoms, peak at about 24 hours, and remain elevated for 7 to 10 days. This prolonged elevation makes troponins useful for diagnosing myocardial infarction several days after the onset of symptoms. This is particularly useful in patients who present late, or in those who may have had a second myocardial infarction in the days following an initial event, as is suspected in this patient.

Option A, LDH, is not specific for cardiac muscle and can be elevated in many conditions including liver disease, kidney disease, and lung disease. It is also released more slowly than troponins or CK-MB following a myocardial infarction, with levels peaking 72 hours after the onset of symptoms.

Option B, CK-MB, is a cardiac-specific isoenzyme of creatine kinase. It begins to rise 3 to 6 hours after the onset of symptoms, peaks at 24 hours, and returns to normal within 48 to 72 hours. Therefore, CK-MB can be used to diagnose a myocardial infarction in the acute setting, but its levels may have returned to normal by the time this patient has recurrent symptoms 56 hours post-angioplasty.

Option D, Troponin I, is similar to Troponin T in its utility for diagnosing myocardial infarction. However, the question asked specifically about Troponin T.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is C. Troponin T. 

In patients with suspected myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac troponin levels (either I or T) are the preferred biomarkers for diagnosis. Troponins are part of the contractile apparatus of myocardial cells, and they are released into the circulation when myocardial necrosis occurs. Troponin levels begin to rise 3 to 4 hours after the onset of MI, peak at about 24 hours, and remain elevated for 7 to 10 days. This prolonged elevation makes troponin levels useful for diagnosing MI even days after the event.

Option A: LDH isoenzymes used to be used in the diagnosis of MI, but they are no longer recommended due to low specificity. LDH is also found in many other tissues and can be elevated in conditions such as hemolysis, liver disease, and malignancy.

Option B: CK-MB was previously the preferred biomarker for MI, but it has been largely replaced by troponins because they are more specific and sensitive. CK-MB levels begin to rise about 6 hours after MI, peak at 18 to 24 hours, and return to baseline within 2 to 3 days. Thus, they may not be elevated in patients who present several days after an MI, as in this patient.

Option D: Troponin I is also a sensitive and specific marker for MI. However, in the question, Troponin T is mentioned. Both Troponin T and I would be equally valid answers if both were mentioned in a similar question.

5654,"The correct answer is A. 'Downward and outward gaze, ptosis, and a fixed, dilated pupil'.

The oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) innervates the majority of the extraocular muscles (superior, inferior, and medial rectus; inferior oblique; and levator palpebrae superioris), which are responsible for eye movement and eyelid elevation. It also carries parasympathetic fibers to the eye, controlling pupil constriction and lens accommodation.

Diabetic mononeuropathy often manifests as an isolated cranial nerve palsy, most commonly of the oculomotor nerve. Hyperglycemia-induced ischemia of the vasa nervorum leads to nerve infarction and subsequent dysfunction. The parasympathetic fibers are located peripherally in the nerve and are thus spared, resulting in a normal pupillary reaction.

The patient in the vignette has a ""blown"" pupil (ie, fixed and dilated), which indicates uncal herniation until proven otherwise. The uncal portion of the hippocampus herniates through the tentorium cerebelli, compressing the oculomotor nerve and the posterior cerebral artery. This leads to an ""down and out"" gaze (due to unopposed lateral rectus and superior oblique activity), ptosis (due to levator palpebrae superioris paralysis), and a fixed, dilated pupil (due to parasympathetic pupilloconstrictor paralysis).

B: In diabetic oculomotor nerve palsy, the pupil is spared and remains reactive to light.
C: Diabetic oculomotor nerve palsy also causes problems with extraocular movements.

5670,"The correct answer is 'C: Weakness in shoulder abduction and numbness over the lateral shoulder'. 

The nerve most likely to be damaged during an axillary lymph node dissection is the long thoracic nerve, which provides motor innervation to the serratus anterior muscle. However, it is typically located more medially and not as likely to be injured as the axillary nerve. 

The axillary nerve is closely associated with the surgical neck of the humerus and the axillary lymph nodes, making it susceptible to injury during procedures such as axillary lymph node dissection or fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus. The axillary nerve provides motor innervation to the deltoid (abduction of the arm) and the teres minor muscles (lateral rotation of the arm). It also provides sensory innervation to the skin over the lower deltoid muscle (the ""regimental badge area""), hence the patient would present with weakness in shoulder abduction and numbness over the lateral shoulder (Option C).

Option A refers to the damage of the subscapular nerves, which innervate the subscapularis and teres major muscles, leading to difficulty with internal rotation, adduction, and extension of the arm.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is C, ""Weakness in shoulder abduction and numbness over the lateral shoulder"".

The axilla contains several important structures, including the axillary artery, axillary vein, and parts of the brachial plexus. The long thoracic nerve and thoracodorsal nerve also pass through this region. The long thoracic nerve innervates the serratus anterior muscle, which is responsible for protraction of the scapula. Injury to this nerve can lead to a ""winged scapula"" (Option B), but the said nerve is usually located more medially and would not be damaged during axillary lymph node dissection. Similarly, the thoracodorsal nerve innervates the latissimus dorsi muscle, which contributes to internal rotation, adduction, and extension of the arm (Option A), but this nerve is also not typically at risk during axillary lymph node dissection.

The structure at greatest risk of injury during axillary dissection is the axillary nerve, which provides motor innervation to the deltoid and the teres minor muscles and sensory innervation to the skin over the lateral aspect of the shoulder (the ""regimental badge area""). Damage to the axillary nerve would therefore cause weakness in shoulder abduction (performed by the deltoid) and numbness over the lateral shoulder (Option C). 

Option D is incorrect because the radial nerve, which would cause weakness in wrist extension and numbness over the dorsal hand if injured, is not typically affected during an axillary dissection. 

Option E is incorrect because the musculocutaneous nerve, which would cause weakness in arm flexion at the elbow and numbness over the lateral forearm if damaged, is not typically affected during axillary dissection."
5672,"The correct answer is A: Type I collagen. 

The description provided in the case of a raised, hyperpigmented, rubbery scar that extends beyond the boundaries of the initial incision is characteristic of a keloid. Keloids are benign growths of dense, fibrous tissue that usually form after skin injury in predisposed individuals, including those of African descent.

5677,"The correct answer is 'A: Glutathione depletion'. This patient's symptoms of headache, dizziness, and nausea after exposure to carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) suggest acute toxic exposure. CCl4 is a hepatotoxin and nephrotoxin that is primarily metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 system to form the highly reactive trichloromethyl free radical (CCl3). This free radical can initiate lipid peroxidation or directly bind to cellular macromolecules, resulting in cellular injury. Additionally, it can bind to oxygen to form the trichloromethyl peroxyl radical (CCl3OOâ?¢), which is even more reactive and cytotoxic.

The body's primary defense against such free radicals is the tripeptide glutathione, which non-enzymatically reacts with the CCl3 and CCl3OOâ?¢ radicals to form inactive complexes that are excreted in the bile. Glutathione depletion leads to increased availability of CCl3 and CCl3OOâ?¢, promoting lipid peroxidation and cellular injury.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is A. Glutathione depletion.

This patient's symptoms are suggestive of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) poisoning. CCl4 is a hepatotoxic compound that was once widely used as a refrigerant and propellant but is now primarily used in the manufacture of refrigeration fluid and propellants. Exposure often occurs through inhalation, ingestion, or skin contact and can result in central nervous system depression, gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting), kidney injury, and liver injury.

The liver injury caused by CCl4 is due to free radical formation and lipid peroxidation. Specifically, CCl4 is converted by CYP2E1 in the liver to the highly reactive trichloromethyl free radical (CCl3*). This free radical can directly initiate lipid peroxidation, which leads to cellular injury. Alternatively, CCl3 can react with oxygen to form the trichloromethyl peroxyl radical (CCl3OO*), which can also cause lipid peroxidation.

Cells protect themselves from this oxidative stress by using the antioxidant glutathione, which can donate hydrogen atoms to free radicals, converting them to more stable, non-reactive species. However, in the setting of significant CCl4 exposure, glutathione stores can be depleted, eliminating this protective mechanism and leading to cell injury and death.

Option B, Metabolite haptenization, is incorrect. This involves drug metabolites binding to proteins, forming a complex that the immune system recognizes as foreign, leading to an immune response. This process is not involved in CCl4 toxicity.

Option C, Protoporphyrin accumulation, is incorrect. This is typically seen in disorders of heme production, such as in lead poisoning or porphyrias, not with CCl4 poisoning.

Option D, Microtubule stabilization, is incorrect. This may occur in response to certain drugs (eg, paclitaxel, colchicine), but is not a feature of CCl4 toxicity.

Option E, Lipid peroxidation is the mechanism of CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity, but this process is not directly related to the laboratory abnormalities shown. These abnormalities are instead due to the depletion of glutathione, a key antioxidant that is used up in an effort to protect the cell from CCl4-induced oxidative stress."

Hereditary spherocytosis is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by defects in erythrocyte membrane proteins (ankyrin, spectrin, or band 3), leading to instability and loss of membrane, resulting in spherical erythrocytes.

Spherocytes are less capable of maneuvering through the spleen's sinusoids, which leads to their sequestration and destruction, causing hemolysis.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The question doesn't provide an image, but from the given options and the mentioned symptoms, it seems like this is a case of Median nerve damage. The median nerve is responsible for the movement of opposition of the thumb, which is option B. Thus, physical examination is most likely to show impairment of opposition of the thumb.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A: Extension of the wrist and fingers is primarily handled by the Radial nerve, not the Median nerve.
C: Flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joints is also managed by the Median nerve, but to a lesser extent than the opposition of thumb.
D: Flexion of the forearm is mainly carried by the Musculocutaneous nerve.
E: Abduction of the shoulder above 100 degrees is primarily managed by the Axillary nerve. 

Therefore, the best answer would be option B, Opposition of the thumb. This movement is mainly managed by the Median nerve. Any impairments in the function of this nerve would lead to difficulty in opposing the thumb."
5703,"This patient's history of oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, and bilateral renal disease with multiple cysts suggests the diagnosis of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD).

5706,"This patient's chronic kidney disease (CKD) can lead to anemia via a decrease in erythropoietin (EPO) production, impaired iron utilization, and decreased red cell lifespan. This patientâ??s normochromic, normocytic anemia and fatigue were consistent with anemia of CKD, prompting his nephrologist to initiate therapy with recombinant human EPO. However, the patient's anemia has not improved significantly, which suggests another contributing factor to his anemia.
Patients with CKD often have functional iron deficiency, where there is adequate iron storage (normal or high ferritin) but impaired mobilization and utilization of iron for erythropoiesis (low transferrin saturation). Functional iron deficiency can occur due to inflammation, which is commonly seen in patients with CKD. EPO stimulates red cell production and can exacerbate functional iron deficiency by increasing iron utilization in the bone marrow, thereby contributing to anemia.

This patient with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who continues to have anemia despite erythropoietin (EPO) therapy likely has functional iron deficiency. Iron deficiency in ESRD can be absolute (due to decreased intake or increased loss) or functional (due to inflammation or inadequate utilization). Functional iron deficiency is common in ESRD and is often due to the use of EPO, which increases the demand for iron in the bone marrow for erythropoiesis. Despite sufficient stored iron (normal or increased ferritin), the supply of iron to the erythroid precursors is inadequate (normal or decreased transferrin saturation), resulting in a high total iron-binding capacity.

The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is typically normal as this is primarily a disorder of iron utilization rather than availability. The red cell distribution width (RDW), which measures the variability in red blood cell size, is usually high due to the release of both microcytic (iron-deficient) and normocytic (iron-replete) red blood cells from the bone marrow.

Option A and B are incorrect as they suggest absolute iron deficiency (low ferritin, low transferrin saturation), which is not the case in this patient.

Option C is incorrect as it suggests an increased ferritin and low transferrin saturation but with a low MCV, which is not consistent with this patient's likely normal MCV.

Option E is incorrect as it suggests a normal RDW, which contradicts the expected increased RDW due to the release of variably-sized red blood cells from the bone marrow."
5710,"This patient's hypertension, elevated Tanner stage relative to her amenorrhea, and her mother's history of delayed menarche suggest the diagnosis of 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency. 17 alpha-hydroxylase is an enzyme that is critical in the synthesis of glucocorticoids and sex steroids. Thus, deficiency causes decreased synthesis of cortisol, aldosterone, and sex steroids. The resultant decrease in cortisol triggers an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) via loss of negative feedback, which leads to overstimulation of the adrenal cortex and overproduction of the mineralocorticoids, the synthesis of which does not require 17 alpha-hydroxylase. Excess mineralocorticoids cause hypertension and hypokalemia. Lack of sex steroid production also leads to a lack of secondary sexual characteristics and primary amenorrhea. This enzyme is also required to make androgens, and thus you would not expect to see the elevated levels of androstenedione in option B. For the same reason, you would not expect to see low levels of androstenedione in option E. Regarding 17-hydroxyprogesterone (option A), this metabolite is upstream of the 17 alpha-hydroxylase enzyme in the steroidogenesis pathway, so its levels would be low or normal, not elevated. Lastly, ACTH levels would be elevated due to loss of negative feedback from cortisol (not low as in option D). Therefore, the correct answer is Option C: Elevated levels of 17-hydroxypregnenolone.

5715,"This patient's severe headache, elevated blood pressure, proteinuria, visual symptoms, and altered mental status are suggestive of eclampsia, which is characterized by seizures in the setting of preeclampsia. The focal neurologic deficits (eg, cranial nerve VI palsy and hemiplegia) suggest a posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). PRES is a neurologic disorder seen in patients with eclampsia, severe preeclampsia, or hypertension. It is thought to be due to failure of cerebrovascular autoregulation and subsequent hyperperfusion injury, leading to endothelial damage, vasogenic edema, and cerebral ischemia. 

Clinically, PRES often presents with headache, visual disturbances, and seizures. These symptoms are often reversible if the underlying cause (eg, hypertension) is treated promptly.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's hypertension, seizure, headache, proteinuria, and vision changes indicate severe preeclampsia with CNS involvement (eg, eclampsia, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [PRES]). Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder characterized by hypertension and end-organ dysfunction, most commonly affecting the liver, kidneys, coagulation system, and CNS. Eclampsia is diagnosed when seizures occur in this setting. Patients with eclampsia can also develop PRES, a syndrome characterized by headache, altered mental status, seizures, and/or visual disturbances. It is believed to occur due to failed autoregulation of cerebral blood flow and endothelial dysfunction, leading to vasogenic edema. Bilateral neurologic symptoms (eg, vision loss, altered mental status), as opposed to unilateral neurologic deficits, are most typical. Imaging findings are most commonly seen in the posterior cerebral white matter (eg, parieto-occipital lobes) but can be found anywhere in the brain. MRI is the preferred imaging modality and typically shows areas of vasogenic (not cytotoxic) edema, but if a CT scan is performed, it would show subcortical hypodense regions (ie, edema) with surrounding irregular hyperdense margins (Choice E).

Choice B: Hyperattenuating material in the subarachnoid space is seen in subarachnoid hemorrhage, which typically presents with severe headache and meningeal signs.
Choice C: A pontine hemorrhage would cause ""locked-in"" syndrome (ie, paralysis of all voluntary muscles except the eyes).
Choice D: Cord-like hyperattenuation in the superior sagittal sinus is seen in cerebral venous thrombosis and would present with headache, seizure, and focal neurologic deficits (eg, hemiparesis, aphasia).

However, this lesion would be unlikely to cause left conjugate gaze paralysis, which is more typically due to damage to the right frontal eye field."
5728,"This case is likely describing cyanotic congenital heart disease, specifically tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). TOF is characterized by four abnormalities: (1) pulmonic stenosis, (2) right ventricular hypertrophy, (3) ventricular septal defect, and (4) overriding aorta. Thus, the answer is B: Overriding aorta.

The cyanosis described in this case is caused by right-to-left shunting of blood secondary to severe pulmonic stenosis. Because of the pressure differential, blood bypasses the lungs and is shunted from the right to the left side of the heart, resulting in systemic delivery of deoxygenated blood. The severity of cyanosis depends on the degree of pulmonic stenosis and the size of the ventricular septal defect. 

Let's discuss why the other options are incorrect:

A: Increased pulmonary vascular markings are seen in conditions with increased pulmonary blood flow, such as ventricular or atrial septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus, and others. In TOF, due to the pulmonic stenosis, there is decreased blood flow to the lungs, so this finding is not expected.

C: Absent aorticopulmonary septum is seen in truncus arteriosus, a different congenital heart disease. In this condition, the aorta and pulmonary artery originate from a common trunk, which is not described in this case.

D: Pulmonic valvular stenosis is indeed one of the features of TOF, but the question asks for another possible finding, and this is already implied in the case presentation.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The neonate's hypotonicity, cyanosis (blue color), and sudden death post-delivery are suggestive of a severe congenital heart disease. The ECG findings of left axis deviation and the auscultation findings (presumably a murmur) further support this. The most commonly encountered cyanotic heart disease in neonates is Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), which may be more likely given the consanguineous relationship, as genetic factors can contribute to its development. TOF consists of four anomalies: ventricular septal defect, overriding aorta, right ventricular hypertrophy, and pulmonic stenosis. Therefore, the most likely finding in this neonate would be an overriding aorta (Choice B), which is when the aorta is positioned right over the ventricular septal defect, receiving blood from both ventricles.

The other options are not as typical of TOF: 
- ""Increased pulmonary vascular markings"" (Choice A) are seen in conditions of pulmonary overcirculation, such as a large ventricular septal defect or patent ductus arteriosus, not in TOF where blood flow to the lungs is typically decreased.
- ""Absent aorticopulmonary septum"" (Choice C) could suggest truncus arteriosus, another congenital heart disease, but is less common than TOF and the overall clinical picture fits TOF better.
- ""Pulmonic valvular stenosis"" (Choice D) is a component of TOF, but the question asks for a radiological finding, which would make the ""overriding aorta"" the better choice.
- ""Mediastinal narrowing"" (Choice E) can be seen in conditions like coarctation of the aorta, but wouldn't be expected in the context of TOF.
  
Therefore, the best answer is Option B, ""Overriding aorta""."
5736,"The correct answer is A: Metformin. 

This patient's elevated A1c indicates poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (DM). An A1c of 8.5% is above the recommended target of â?¤7.0% for most adults with type 2 diabetes. Initial treatment for patients with type 2 DM is lifestyle intervention (eg, weight loss, dietary modification, regular physical activity), in addition to a single antihyperglycemic agent.

Metformin reduces hepatic glucose production and improves insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. It is also weight neutral, which is beneficial in this patient who is morbidly obese.

Option B, sulfonylurea added to metformin, is not the best next step because adding another medication should be considered only after monotherapy has been trialed and not achieved the glycemic target.

Current guidelines recommend metformin as first-line pharmacotherapy for T2DM in conjunction with lifestyle modifications (including diet, exercise, and weight loss). Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production and improves insulin sensitivity in the peripheral tissues. It has been shown to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and is weight neutral or may induce modest weight loss. 

Option 'B', 'Sulphonylurea added to metformin', is not a correct choice because sulfonylurea is typically added to metformin if monotherapy does not achieve glycemic control after 3 months. In this case, the patient is just diagnosed with diabetes, so metformin should be tried first.

This patient's worsening pain, difficulty sleeping, fatigue, low mood, social withdrawal, concentration difficulties, and suicidal ideation meet criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). In patients with fibromyalgia, as with other chronic pain syndromes, the incidence of depression is high. Pain and depression share neurochemical pathways, and each can exacerbate the other. Antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants, are first-line treatments for fibromyalgia and can be beneficial for both pain and mood symptoms. Psychotherapy, specifically cognitive-behavioral therapy, also has been shown to improve outcomes in fibromyalgia and MDD.

Option A: Although gabapentin can be helpful in neuropathic pain, it is less effective in fibromyalgia and does not address the patient's depression. 

Option B: Although the patient is expressing suicidal ideation, it's not clear from the vignette whether she has a specific plan or the means to carry out the plan, which would elevate her risk and necessitate hospitalization.

Option C: While it is important to assess for suicide risk, asking about a specific plan should be done in the context of a larger safety assessment, which includes an evaluation of protective factors and the patient's level of distress, in addition to the availability of firearms or other means of suicide. 

Option E: Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that can be used in fibromyalgia for its analgesic properties. However, its side effect profile (eg, anticholinergic effects, orthostatic hypotension) makes it less desirable as a first-line agent. The patient might benefit more from an SNRI such as duloxetine, which can help with both pain and depressive symptoms.","stop","the correct answer is d.

She reports that her pain has become more severe over the last several weeks and is no longer well-controlled by NSAIDs. She notes that the pain is beginning to interfere with her sleep and that she feels she no longer has energy to take care of her 2-year-old son. Upon questioning, the patient also endorses feeling more down than usual recently, little interest in seeing friends, and difficulty concentrating on her work. She admits to feeling that she would be Ã¢â?¬Å?better off dead.Ã¢â?¬Â The patient feels strongly that the worsening pain is driving these changes in her mood and that she would feel better if her pain was better controlled.

This patient's feelings of sadness and loss of interest in usual activities, difficulty concentrating, fatigue, and thoughts of death are suggestive of major depressive disorder (MDD). Patients with MDD often have somatic symptoms, and when they are prominent, they can overshadow the affective symptoms and make diagnosis difficult. Most patients with MDD who are suicidal believe that their death would somehow make things better. This patient's belief that her physical pain is the cause of her depressive symptoms is an example of this cognitive distortion, and it is important to recognize this as a sign of the severity of her depressive symptoms. 

Duloxetine is a first-line treatment for MDD and also has indications for the management of chronic pain, including fibromyalgia pain. Psychotherapy (eg, cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy) is also an essential component of treatment for patients with MDD. 

Option A is incorrect because it doesn't address the patient's depressive symptoms. Option B is not the best choice at this time as the patient doesn't present an immediate risk to herself or others. Option C is incorrect because it might not be beneficial and could possibly increase the risk of suicide by suggesting self-harm methods. Option E is not the best choice as duloxetine is preferred over amitriptyline due to its dual effect on both depression and chronic pain."

5812,"The correct answer is 'D': Release of epinephrine by the adrenal medulla.

Explanation: The pupillary dilator muscle is innervated by the sympathetic nervous system, which uses norepinephrine as its primary neurotransmitter. A drug that increases neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic nerve terminal of the sympathetic nervous system would also be likely to stimulate other actions of the sympathetic nervous system when administered systemically. The release of epinephrine by the adrenal medulla is a function of the sympathetic nervous system.

Why the other options are wrong:
A: Contraction of skeletal muscles - Skeletal muscle contraction is controlled by the somatic nervous system, not the sympathetic nervous system. This process involves the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, not norepinephrine.

B: Acceleration of gut peristalsis - The enteric nervous system, which is primarily controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system, regulates gut peristalsis. The parasympathetic nervous system uses acetylcholine as its primary neurotransmitter, so increasing norepinephrine release would not accelerate gut peristalsis.

C: Relaxation of the bladder neck sphincter - Relaxation of the bladder neck sphincter is a function of the parasympathetic nervous system. The neurotransmitter involved in this process is acetylcholine, not norepinephrine.

E: Increase in pyloric sphincter tone - The pyloric sphincter is controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system, which uses acetylcholine as its primary neurotransmitter.

Option: {'A': 'Contraction of skeletal muscles', 'B': 'Acceleration of gut peristalsis', 'C': 'Relaxation of the bladder neck sphincter', 'D': 'Release of epinephrine by the adrenal medulla', 'E': 'Increase in pyloric sphincter tone'}

Option D, 'Release of epinephrine by the adrenal medulla', is the correct answer. The adrenal medulla is stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system to release epinephrine (adrenaline) into the bloodstream, which produces a 'fight or flight' response that includes increased heart rate, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels.

Option A is incorrect because skeletal muscle contraction is primarily controlled by the somatic nervous system, not the sympathetic nervous system. Option B is also incorrect because the sympathetic nervous system slows down gut peristalsis, not accelerate it. Option C is incorrect because the sympathetic nervous system contracts (tightens) the bladder neck sphincter, not relax it.

5823,"The correct answer is 'A': Sympathetic stimulation. 

Lidocaine is an amide local anesthetic that blocks voltage-gated sodium channels, preventing the initiation and transmission of nerve impulses. The order of nerve fiber sensitivity to local anesthetics such as lidocaine generally follows the sequence: B fibers (pain, temperature) > C fibers (pain, temperature, autonomic functions) > AÎ´ fibers (pain, temperature) > AÎ³ fibers (proprioception) > AÎ² fibers (touch, pressure) > AÎ± fibers (motor, proprioception). 

However, sympathetic fibers (part of the autonomic nervous system) are an exception to this rule. They are small, thinly myelinated B fibers and unmyelinated C fibers, but they are less sensitive to local anesthetics than other fibers of similar size. Therefore, sympathetic stimulation would be the last to be blocked by lidocaine.

The other options - 'Pain' (B), 'Temperature' (C), 'Touch' (D), and 'Pressure' (E) are incorrect because these sensory functions are typically blocked before sympathetic stimulation when using local anesthetics like lidocaine.","stop","the correct answer is 'a': sympathetic stimulation.","A","E","USMLE question: A 50-year-old male is brought to the dermatologist's office with complaints of a pigmented lesion.

Lidocaine, a local anesthetic, works by blocking sodium channels and preventing the propagation of action potentials in nerve fibers. It affects different types of nerve fibers in a specific order. The smallest and least myelinated nerve fibers are affected first, while the largest and most heavily myelinated fibers are affected last. 

The order of nerve blockage is generally as follows: pain (B fibers), temperature (C fibers), touch (A-delta fibers), proprioception (A-gamma fibers), and motor function (A-alpha fibers). 

Sympathetic fibers are small but heavily myelinated, which means they are among the last to be blocked by lidocaine.

The other options are incorrect since they represent sensations transmitted by nerve fibers that would be blocked earlier by lidocaine. Pain (B) and temperature (C) are transmitted by smaller, less myelinated fibers, touch (D) by A-delta fibers, and pressure (E) by A-beta fibers, all of which would be blocked before sympathetic stimulation (A)."
5836,"The most likely diagnosis is Hepatic hydatid cyst (Option B).

The patient's presentation is suggestive of a hepatic hydatid cyst, which is caused by Echinococcus granulosus, a parasitic tapeworm. Humans are accidental intermediate hosts and become infected by ingesting food or water contaminated with eggs, or through direct contact with animal hosts (e.g., working in a pet shop). Once ingested, the eggs hatch into larvae in the small intestine and travel through the portal vein to the liver. Here, they form hydatid cysts that can grow over time and cause mass effect symptoms (eg, abdominal pain, hepatomegaly). 

On imaging, these cysts appear as round, hypoechoic lesions, often with internal echoes due to the presence of hydatid sand. Hydatid cysts can rupture, causing anaphylaxis or secondary echinococcosis. As this patient is from Mexico (an endemic region) and works with animals, his risk for this infection is increased.

Options A, D, and E (Amebiasis, Pyogenic liver abscess, Hepatocellular carcinoma) are less likely because the ultrasound findings are not typical. Amebic liver abscesses and pyogenic abscesses are usually hypoechoic but do not contain the internal echoes seen in a hydatid cyst. Hepatocellular carcinoma typically appears as a hyperechoic or mixed echogenic mass on ultrasound. 

Option C (Liver hemangioma) could present with a hypoechoic mass on ultrasound, but these are typically asymptomatic and discovered incidentally. The patient's risk factors and symptoms make a hydatid cyst more likely. 

Finally, the patient's clinical presentation doesn't strongly suggest any of these other diagnoses. For instance, hepatocellular carcinoma is usually seen in patients with chronic liver disease, which this patient does not have. Amebiasis and pyogenic liver abscess would typically present with more systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, and malaise.","stop","the most likely diagnosis is hepatic hydatid cyst (option b).","B","A","USMLE question: A 36-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for right upper quadrant abdominal pain that began 3 days ago.

This patient's presentation of pruritic rash and facial swelling developing within hours of starting a new medication is suggestive of an allergic drug reaction. In severe cases, systemic symptoms (eg, wheezing, stridor, hypotension, gastrointestinal upset) can lead to anaphylaxis. However, this patient's normal vital signs and absence of respiratory symptoms indicate that she is not in anaphylactic shock. Nonetheless, because angioedema (manifested by the facial and lip swelling) can cause airway compromise and progression to anaphylaxis, immediate treatment is necessary.

Intramuscular epinephrine (option D) is the first-line treatment for angioedema and anaphylaxis. Epinephrine works by reversing the effects of mast cell mediator release (eg, histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins) through alpha1-adrenergic receptor agonist activity (vasoconstriction, decreased edema) and beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist activity (bronchodilation). Corticosteroids (eg, hydrocortisone) are given to prevent biphasic reactions.

An anaphylactic reaction is a systemic, type I hypersensitivity reaction that often occurs within minutes to 2 hours after exposure to an allergen, though onset can be delayed up to several hours in some cases. Initial management includes discontinuation of the inciting agent and close monitoring of vital signs. Because this patient's reaction involves multiple organ systems (ie, skin, mucosa), pharmacologic treatment is indicated. The first-line treatment for anaphylaxis is intramuscular epinephrine, which reverses airway edema, bronchoconstriction, and hypotension by its Ã?Â±1-, Ã?Â²1-, and Ã?Â²2-agonist effects. In contrast, the effect of corticosteroids, antihistamines, and H2 blockers is beneficial but slow in onset and does not replace the need for epinephrine.

This patient's epigastric pain radiating to the back, nausea, and vomiting in the setting of a history of biliary colic suggest acute pancreatitis.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is C. Total Bilirubin.

This patient's history of biliary colic, upper abdominal pain radiating to the back, nausea and vomiting, and the presence of abnormal liver function tests (eg, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin) and markedly elevated amylase and lipase are consistent with acute pancreatitis (AP) due to gallstones (most common cause). The diagnosis of AP requires two of the following three criteria: 1) abdominal pain consistent with the disease, 2) serum amylase and/or lipase >3 times upper limit of normal, 3) characteristic findings from abdominal imaging.

Once the diagnosis of AP is made, it is important to assess disease severity, which is classified as either mild interstitial pancreatitis or severe necrotizing pancreatitis. Severity has prognostic implications and dictates management. Ranson's criteria on admission and at 48 hours can be used to predict severity and mortality. In gallstone pancreatitis, the most important initial prognostic indicators are age >55 and the presence of leukocytosis, high blood glucose, elevated serum alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase, and mental status changes. Additional indicators of severe disease include an increase in hematocrit, a decrease in serum calcium, hypoxemia, an increase in blood urea nitrogen, and the presence of increased serum total bilirubin (option C) and/or base deficit. Therefore, an increase in total bilirubin is associated with increased mortality in AP.

The other options are incorrect because they do not correlate with increased mortality in acute pancreatitis. While they may be elevated due to the disease process, their levels do not predict the severity or mortality of the disease."
5886,"The patient's presentation suggests he developed warfarin-induced skin necrosis, a rare complication of warfarin therapy. This condition typically presents within the first few days of therapy as painful, erythematous lesions that progress to necrosis and ulceration. These lesions are most common on areas of the body with abundant subcutaneous fat, such as the breasts, thighs, buttocks, and abdomen. The underlying pathophysiology of warfarin-induced skin necrosis involves a temporary hypercoagulable state induced by the relative decrease in proteins C and S. Warfarin inhibits the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors, including factors II, VII, IX, X, and the anticoagulant proteins C and S. Proteins C and S have the shortest half-lives among the factors affected by warfarin, so their activity decreases the fastest upon initiation of warfarin therapy. Thus, the initial effect of warfarin is a decrease in anticoagulant activity, causing a hypercoagulable state until the levels of the other coagulation factors decrease. Patients with preexisting protein C or S deficiency are particularly at risk for complications such as skin necrosis and venous limb gangrene. Therefore, the correct answer is C, Factors II, VII, IX, and X.

Option A is incorrect because warfarin affects more than just Factor II.
Option B is incorrect because warfarin affects more than just Factors II and X.

The intravenous medication is discontinued in favor of an oral medication in preparation for discharge; however, the patient leaves against medical advice prior to receiving the full set of instructions. The next day, the patient is found to have black lesions on his trunk and his leg. The protein involved in this patient's underlying abnormality most likely affects the function of which of the following factors?

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The patient's history of trauma and recent hospitalization with resultant deep vein thrombosis (as evidenced by lower extremity swelling, redness, and pain) suggests he was started on a medication for anticoagulation. The subsequent development of black lesions after discharge could represent necrosis due to warfarin-induced skin necrosis, a rare but serious complication seen during the initial stages of warfarin therapy. Warfarin, an oral anticoagulant, inhibits the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors in the liver, including Factors II, VII, IX, and X, along with proteins C and S. Protein C has the shortest half-life; therefore, it is the first to be depleted when warfarin therapy is initiated. Protein C normally functions as an anticoagulant by degrading Factors Va and VIIIa. A temporary hypercoagulable state can therefore occur early in the course of warfarin therapy due to a deficiency of protein C outpacing the drop in the procoagulant vitamin K-dependent factors, leading to thrombotic skin necrosis. 

This is why the correct answer is C, Factors II, VII, IX, and X.

A, B, D, E are incorrect because warfarin does not affect only one or two clotting factors, but several - Factors II, VII, IX, and X."
5888,"The correct answer is D. Sharp surgical debridement of the ulcer.

This patient has a neuropathic ulcer. This is a common complication of diabetes mellitus and is due to peripheral neuropathy and repetitive microtrauma. It typically occurs at sites of high pressure such as the plantar aspect of the foot under the metatarsal heads or heel. Clinical features include a painless ulcer often with a callous rim and neuropathic symptoms (eg, decreased sensation to vibration and light touch). Management includes off-loading pressure (eg, total contact casting, therapeutic shoes with custom insoles) and control of infection. When ulcers show evidence of deep soft tissue infection (eg, purulence, erythema, foul odor) or bone involvement, they should be sharply debrided. This allows visualization of the extent of the infection and removal of nonviable tissue, which promotes healing.

Option A (Total contact casting of the right foot) is incorrect because although off-loading pressure is an important aspect of management, it would not address the underlying infection, which needs to be treated first.

Option B (Amputation of the right forefoot) is incorrect as this is a last resort for severe, refractory cases. In this case, the patient's ulcer is relatively small and there is no bone involvement on X-ray.

Option C (Intravenous antibiotic therapy) is not the initial step, though it may be necessary if there is evidence of systemic infection, which this patient doesn't have.

Option E (Surgical revascularization of the right foot) is incorrect because the patient has intact pedal pulses, indicating that there is sufficient blood flow to the foot. This would be an option in peripheral artery disease, which is not the case here.","stop","the correct answer is d. sharp surgical debridement of the ulcer.","D","D","USMLE question: A 43-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a painless ulcer on the sole of her right foot. There is no history of trauma. She has been dressing the ulcer once daily at home with gauze. She has a 15-year history of poorly-controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Current medications include insulin and lisinopril. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a 2 x 2-cm ulcer on the plantar aspect of the base of the great toe with whitish, loose tissue on the floor of the ulcer and a calloused margin. A blunt metal probe reaches the deep plantar space. Sensation to vibration and light touch is decreased over both feet. Pedal pulses are intact. An x-ray of the right foot shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?
Option: {'A': 'Total contact casting of right foot', 'B': 'Amputation of the right forefoot', 'C': 'Intravenous antibiotic therapy', 'D': 'Sharp surgical debridement of the ulcer', 'E': 'Surgical revascularization of the right foot'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's history of poorly-controlled diabetes and foot ulcer with loss of protective sensation, but preserved pulses (indicating adequate arterial perfusion) is consistent with a diabetic neuropathic ulcer. The high-pressure points of the plantar surface of the foot (typically metatarsal heads, heel) are most commonly affected. Neuropathy results in an insensate foot, and patients often do not notice minor trauma or pressure, leading to ulcer formation. The primary management of neuropathic ulcers involves relieving pressure at the site of the ulcer. This can be accomplished using special footwear, orthotics, or total contact casting (choice A). A total contact cast is a well-padded cast that redistributes weight-bearing forces from the ulcer to the entire plantar aspect of the foot, allowing the ulcer to heal. Total contact casting has been shown to heal neuropathic ulcers better than removable cast walkers or half-shoes.

Sharp surgical debridement (choice D) is indicated for necrotic, nonviable tissue. The loose, whitish tissue in the base of this patient's ulcer may be slough (ie, fibrin, pus, proteinaceous debris) rather than necrotic tissue. Slough is generally soft and can be removed with wet-to-dry dressings or enzymatic agents. Surgical debridement should be reserved for necrotic (ie, black, hard eschar) tissue. 

Intravenous antibiotics (choice C) are not indicated unless there are signs of systemic infection (eg, fever, leukocytosis) or severe local infection (eg, abscess, spreading cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, gangrene, osteomyelitis). 

Amputation (choice B) and surgical revascularization (choice E) are generally reserved for patients with severe infection, necrosis, or ischemia not responding to conservative management. The presence of palpable pedal pulses in this patient makes significant peripheral arterial disease less likely."
5906,"The patient's mitral valve replacement, low-grade fever, malaise, weight loss, extreme fatigue, and new systolic murmur suggest infective endocarditis. Of the given options, coagulase-negative Staphylococci, including Staphylococcus epidermidis (Option B), are the most common cause of late prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) (i.e., >1 year after surgery). Other common causes of late PVE include viridans group Streptococci and Enterococci. Patients typically present with indolent, nonspecific symptoms like fatigue, low-grade fever, and weight loss.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's low-grade fever, weight loss, malaise, and new murmur are suggestive of infective endocarditis. Prosthetic valve endocarditis can be divided into early (<1 year after surgery) and late (>1 year after surgery) based on the timing of onset. Early prosthetic valve endocarditis is usually due to intraoperative contamination with Staphylococcus species (including coagulase-negative staphylococci) and Gram-negative bacilli. In contrast, late prosthetic valve endocarditis is similar to native valve endocarditis in that it is usually caused by Streptococcus species. Candida and other fungi can also cause prosthetic valve endocarditis, but this is less common and often associated with intravenous drug use.

Option A: Candida albicans is less likely, as fungal endocarditis usually occurs in the setting of intravenous drug use or immunocompromise and tends to have a more acute presentation.
Option B: Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. is a common cause of early but not late prosthetic valve endocarditis.
Option C: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is less likely, as it is not a common cause of endocarditis.
Option E: Escherichia coli is less likely, as it is not a common cause of endocarditis.

So, the correct answer is Option D, Enterococcus. Enterococci are a common cause of native and late prosthetic valve endocarditis. They are part of the normal gut flora and can enter the bloodstream through a gastrointestinal or genitourinary focus. Enterococci are resistant to many antibiotics and have the ability to form biofilms, making them particularly adept at colonizing foreign bodies such as prosthetic heart valves."
5953,"The patient's clinical presentation and histopathological findings are suggestive of alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, a genetic disorder that primarily affects the lungs and liver. Patients with this condition are unable to produce sufficient quantities of AAT, a protein that protects the lungs from neutrophil elastase, an enzyme that can destroy lung tissue. In the liver, misfolded AAT molecules aggregate into globules, leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. PAS staining is typically positive in these globules. The protein responsible for the elastic recoil of the lungs during expiration is elastin. The elastic properties of elastin are conferred by the cross-linking of lysine residues, a process that involves oxidative deamination. Therefore, the correct answer is 'A': Oxidative deamination of lysine residues.

Option 'B': Hydroxylation of proline residues and Option 'C': Arrangement in a triple helical structure are processes that contribute to the formation and structural integrity of collagen, not elastin.

Option 'D': Formation of disulfide bridges are important for the structural stability of many proteins, but they do not contribute to the elastic properties of elastin.

Option: {'A': 'Oxidative deamination of lysine residues', 'B': 'Hydroxylation of proline residues', 'C': 'Arrangement in a triple helical structure', 'D': 'Formation of disulfide bridges', 'E': 'N-glycosylation of serine residues'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's postmortem histological findings of PAS-positive globules within periportal hepatocytes and reduced levels of a protein that is involved in lung recoil suggest a diagnosis of alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency. A1AT is a serine protease inhibitor produced in the liver that protects the lung from damage by neutrophil elastase. In A1AT deficiency, the protein misfolds in the liver, leading to its accumulation (hence the PAS-positive globules) and a reduced level in the lungs, resulting in unchecked proteolytic activity (neutrophil elastase) and subsequent early-onset panacinar emphysema. 

The formation of disulfide bridges (Option D) is crucial in maintaining the tertiary and quaternary structure of proteins, including A1AT, so this would be the most likely process contributing to the elastic properties of the protein.

Option A (oxidative deamination of lysine residues) and Option E (N-glycosylation of serine residues) are processes involved in posttranslational modification of proteins, but not specifically with the elastic properties. 

Option B (hydroxylation of proline residues) is relevant to the tensile strength of collagen, not the elasticity of proteins.

6106,"This patient's presentation of progressive dyspnea with a significant smoking history and physical exam findings of leaning forward and pursed-lip breathing suggest chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Hypoxemia in COPD occurs due to ventilation-perfusion mismatching and decreased oxygen diffusion across the alveolar-capillary interface. Long-term oxygen therapy in patients with COPD and resting or exertional hypoxemia has been shown to improve survival. The primary mechanisms by which this occurs are by decreasing the work of breathing and reducing pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, the correct answer is 'C: Decreases respiratory rate and work of breathing'.

Option A (Aids in smoking cessation) is incorrect. Although oxygen therapy can help alleviate hypoxemia in patients with COPD, it does not directly aid in smoking cessation.

Option B (Better binding of oxygen to hemoglobin) is also incorrect. Supplemental oxygen does not enhance the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin.

Option D (Free radical formation killing pathogens) is incorrect. Oxygen supplementation does not form free radicals that kill pathogens. High concentrations of oxygen can produce potentially harmful reactive oxygen species, but these are not used therapeutically to kill pathogens.

Option E (Increased oxygen diffusion into capillary) is incorrect because oxygen supplementation does not increase the oxygen diffusion across the alveolar-capillary interface. Oxygen diffusion is determined by the concentration gradient between the alveolus and the capillary, and the surface area and thickness of the alveolar-capillary membrane.

In patients with COPD, oxygen supplementation is primarily beneficial because it 'Decreases respiratory rate and work of breathing' (Option C). The drive for breathing in normal individuals is regulated by CO2 levels in the blood. But in COPD patients, due to chronically high CO2 levels, the stimulus for breathing is hypoxia. Supplemental oxygen reduces the work of breathing by satisfying the hypoxic drive.

Option A, 'Aids in smoking cessation', is not correct. While smoking cessation is crucial in the management of COPD, oxygen therapy does not directly aid in smoking cessation.

Option B, 'Better binding of oxygen to hemoglobin', is not correct. Oxygen therapy does not change the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, it only increases the amount of oxygen available for binding.

Option D, 'Free radical formation killing pathogens', is not correct. Oxygen therapy does not typically function as a pathogen-killing strategy in the body.

6108,"The correct answer is 'C': 'The treatment does not represent the best known option'.

An RCT is not ethically acceptable if it is comparing a novel treatment to a placebo when there already exists a standard treatment that is known to be effective. This is because it is unethical to withhold a known effective treatment from patients in the control group. In this scenario, if the novel chemotherapeutic agent does not represent the best known option, then an RCT would be unethical.

Now, let's analyze the other options:

A: 'Proper treatment response is very common'. This does not rule out an RCT. In fact, it is beneficial for an RCT as it would help to establish the efficacy of the novel treatment by comparing it to the common response.

B: 'The treatment is not widespread in use'. This is often the case in RCTs, as they are frequently used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The widespread use of a treatment is not a prerequisite for conducting an RCT.

D: 'The treatment has a known, adverse outcome'. While this could potentially affect the ethical acceptability of the RCT (if the adverse outcomes are severe and far outweigh any potential benefits), it does not make the RCT unacceptable with regard to study design. The adverse effects could be monitored as part of the RCT and could provide valuable information about the safety of the treatment.

E: 'The treatment is expensive'. The cost of a treatment does not impact the validity or acceptability of an RCT from a study design perspective.

In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), participants are randomly assigned to receive either the intervention being tested or a control treatment (often the best existing treatment or a placebo). It would be unethical to run an RCT where the treatment being tested is known to be less effective than the best-known treatment available. This would potentially expose participants in the experimental group to inferior care and therefore poses an unnecessary risk. 

Option A: 'Proper treatment response is very common' is not a reason to make an RCT unacceptable. High response rates to treatment can actually help demonstrate the efficacy of a new treatment.

Option B: 'The treatment is not widespread in use' is also not a reason to make an RCT unacceptable. In fact, novel treatments are often not widespread in use, and RCTs are a key part of determining their safety and efficacy to make them more widespread.

Option D: 'The treatment has a known, adverse outcome' does not necessarily make an RCT unacceptable. All treatments have potential adverse outcomes. The key is whether the potential benefits of the treatment outweigh the risks. This is often evaluated in previous phases of clinical trials before an RCT is undertaken.

Option E: 'The treatment is expensive' is also not a reason to make an RCT unacceptable. The cost of a treatment does not directly relate to its safety or efficacy. If a treatment is effective but expensive, it might still be valuable to certain patients or in certain contexts."

The most appropriate initial medical therapy for ACS typically includes aspirin (Option E), which helps to prevent further platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in the coronary artery. This is usually administered along with other drugs like nitroglycerin, beta-blockers, and statins. Therefore, 'Administer aspirin' is likely the most appropriate next step in management in this case.

Option A: Heparin therapy would be considered in a confirmed diagnosis of ACS, especially in non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or unstable angina. However, aspirin is usually given first.

Option B: Surgical intervention only would not be the first line of therapy unless the patient was having a massive myocardial infarction, required immediate revascularization, or if thrombolytics and antiplatelet agents were contraindicated.

Option C: Labetalol, a non-selective beta blocker and alpha-1 receptor blocker, can be used to help control the blood pressure and heart rate in ACS, but it is not typically the first medication administered.

Option D: Administering tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a thrombolytic agent, is generally reserved for confirmed cases of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), which we cannot confirm without an EKG showing ST elevations.

However, given the patient's symptoms of sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, and migrating pain to his left arm and back, the high suspicion would be for an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack).

Option 'E': Administer Aspirin is the most appropriate next step in management. Aspirin helps to prevent further clotting and limit the size of the thrombus in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction (MI).

Option 'A': Begin heparin therapy is not the first step in managing suspected acute MI. While anticoagulation can be a part of treatment, it is generally not the first step.

Option 'B': Surgical intervention only is not the most appropriate next step in management. It's unclear what specific surgical intervention is being referred to here, but invasive procedures are not usually the first line of treatment for an acute MI.

Option 'C': Administer labetalol can be used to manage hypertension, but it's not the first line of treatment in the setting of an acute MI. 

Option 'D': Administer tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is used for STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) or if there's a delay to PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) which is not mentioned in the question. tPA is a thrombolytic agent, and its use must be carefully considered because of the risk of serious bleeding.

The child's presentation of severe diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, in addition to the similar symptoms in other children at the daycare, strongly suggests a contagious gastrointestinal infection. The most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in children is the rotavirus. Rotaviruses are non-enveloped, icosahedral viruses that contain 11 segments of double-stranded RNA. However, since the question asks for the RNA virus that is most likely causing this child's condition, the answer should be E. Single-stranded, icosahedral, non-enveloped, as this describes the Norovirus, another common cause of viral gastroenteritis in children and adults. It's worth noting that there is a vaccine for rotavirus but none for Norovirus, which is consistent with the child's history of vaccine exemption.

The patient's presentation of vomiting, diarrhea, and fever in the context of a daycare outbreak is most consistent with a rotavirus infection. Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe diarrhea in children worldwide. It is highly contagious and spread via the fecal-oral route, often in environments such as daycares. Rotaviruses are double-stranded RNA viruses but are non-enveloped and possess a distinct icosahedral capsid. Routine vaccination against rotavirus has dramatically reduced the incidence of severe disease.

Pathergy, an exaggerated skin injury response, is an additional common feature and can be tested by pricking the skin with a needle and observing for a red, raised skin lesion. In the gastrointestinal system, it can lead to abdominal pain and diarrhea due to inflammation and ulceration. This explains the crampy abdominal pain, diarrhea, and oral ulcers seen in our patient. The patient's notable findings are not due to bowel spasticity (A), as there is no history of constipation or altered bowel habits. Although Campylobacter jejuni is a gram-negative microaerophilic organism (B) that can cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever, especially after consumption of undercooked chicken, it does not cause oral ulcers or skin lesions. This patient does not have a p-ANCA positive autoimmune bowel disease (C), such as ulcerative colitis or microscopic polyangiitis, as these would present with bloody diarrhea and systemic symptoms, respectively. Rectal mucosa outpouching (D) or rectal prolapse would present with the sensation of rectal fullness or a mass. Transmural granulomas in the bowel (E), seen in Crohn's disease, can cause similar gastrointestinal symptoms, but oral aphthous ulcers are far less common and granulomatous, rather than ulcerative, lesions are seen throughout the alimentary tract.

E) Temporal artery - conditions affecting the temporal artery, such as temporal arteritis, usually present with head pain, jaw claudication, and vision changes, none of which are reported by the patient."
7354,"The best answer is E: Otitis media. 

Beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems, are commonly used for gram-positive infections, which include Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, the common pathogens causing otitis media (middle ear infection).

In the beta-lactam antibiotics, the beta-lactam ring is crucial for their antibacterial activity. The bulky side chain that the investigator has added to the molecule would protect the beta-lactam ring from being destroyed by bacterial enzymes (beta-lactamases), thereby enhancing the drug's antibacterial effect.

Now let's discuss why the other options are not as likely:

A: Nocardiosis - Nocardia is a gram-positive bacteria, but it is intrinsically resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics due to the production of beta-lactamases and the presence of an impermeable cell wall.

B: Folliculitis - This condition can be caused by a variety of organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, which is often resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics due to the production of beta-lactamase.

C: Erythema migrans - This is a skin rash seen in Lyme disease, which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Beta-lactam antibiotics are not typically the first-line treatment for Lyme disease.

D: Atypical pneumonia - This term refers to pneumonia caused by certain bacteria, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila. These organisms do not have a cell wall and therefore are not susceptible to the action of beta-lactam antibiotics.","stop","the best answer is e: otitis media.","E","B","USMLE question: An investigator is studying the chemical structure of antibiotics and its effect on bacterial growth.

Option: {'A': 'Nocardiosis', 'B': 'Folliculitis', 'C': 'Erythema migrans', 'D': 'Atypical pneumonia', 'E': 'Otitis media'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The answer is E: Otitis media.

Beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins, work by inhibiting the formation of the bacterial cell wall, leading to cell lysis and death. Bulky side chains added to these molecules can prevent bacterial enzymes (beta-lactamases) from breaking down the antibiotics, thereby making them more effective. 

Otitis media is a common infection in children and is often caused by bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. These bacteria can produce beta-lactamases, so an antibiotic resistant to this enzyme would be effective in treating the infection. 

As for the other options:

A: Nocardiosis is a rare infection caused by Nocardia, a bacterium that is usually resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. 

B: Folliculitis is typically caused by Staphylococcus aureus, which often carries a gene for a beta-lactamase enzyme that hydrolyzes the beta-lactam ring, rendering the antibiotic ineffective. However, folliculitis is also commonly caused by other bacteria which may be resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics.

C: Erythema migrans is a characteristic rash of Lyme disease, which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Beta-lactam antibiotics are not typically used to treat Lyme disease.

D: Atypical pneumonia is often caused by organisms such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. These organisms lack a cell wall, and hence beta-lactam antibiotics, which target the cell wall synthesis, are ineffective in treating these infections."
7355,"The correct answer is 'A: Dark histamine containing granules'. 

This is because the inflammatory cell type most likely to be prominent in the early stages of wound healing are Mast cells. Mast cells play a key role in inflammation and allergic reactions. They contain dark-staining granules packed with histamine, an inflammatory mediator. Upon injury, mast cells rapidly degranulate, releasing histamine and other vasoactive substances that increase vascular permeability and cause arteriolar dilation. This causes the classic signs of inflammation: redness (rubor), heat (calor), swelling (tumor), and pain (dolor).

Option 'B: Dramatically expanded endoplasmic reticulum' is a characteristic of plasma cells, which are involved in the humoral immune response by producing antibodies. They would not be the first to appear in acute inflammation.

Option 'C: Large cell with amoeboid movement' describes a macrophage, which phagocytose cellular debris and pathogens. While they do play a role in inflammation, they are not the first cells to respond.

Option 'D: Multiple peripheral processes' is a characteristic of dendritic cells, which are primarily involved in antigen presentation to T-cells, not in the immediate response to tissue injury.

This refers to the characteristics of mast cells which are the first responders to an injury and play a critical role in the initiation of inflammation. They contain granules filled with histamine and other substances. Upon tissue injury, these substances are rapidly released into the interstitium, leading to an immediate inflammatory response characterized by vasodilation (redness), increased vascular permeability (swelling), and stimulation of sensory nerve endings (pain).

Option B: Dramatically expanded endoplasmic reticulum. This is characteristic of plasma cells, which synthesize and secrete large amounts of antibodies. They are involved in humoral immunity and not the initial response to tissue injury.

Option C: Large cell with amoeboid movement. This describes macrophages which are not the first cells to arrive at a site of injury. Neutrophils are the first to arrive, followed by macrophages.

Option D: Multiple peripheral processes. This feature is characteristic of neurons which are not directly involved in the inflammatory response.

Option E: Segmented nuclei. This is characteristic of neutrophils, which are the first cells to arrive at the site of an infection, not a simple injury.

Option: {'A': 'Hepatitis B', 'B': 'Rotavirus infection', 'C': 'Influenza', 'D': 'Rabies', 'E': 'Poliomyelitis'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The answer is A: Hepatitis B.

The question describes a virus that can infect cells and replicate its genome solely through the introduction of its genetic material. This is consistent with the behavior of a virus that uses a DNA intermediate for replication. Among the options listed, Hepatitis B is the only DNA virus. It is a hepadnavirus, characterised by its use of reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate to replicate its DNA genome.

On the other hand, Rotavirus (option B) and Influenza (option C) are both RNA viruses. Poliomyelitis (option E) is caused by Poliovirus, which is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus (ssRNA+), and Rabies (option D) is caused by the Rabies virus, which is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus (ssRNA-). Neither of these viruses use a DNA intermediate in their replication cycles. 

Therefore, Hepatitis B is the best answer because it fits the description of the virus in the question, based on its mechanism of replication."
7593,"This patient's findings of tall stature, pectus excavatum, high-arched feet, and acute onset chest pain are suggestive of Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1). The most life-threatening manifestation of Marfan syndrome is aortic dissection, which can present with acute onset chest pain. The most common cause of death in Marfan syndrome is due to aortic dissection or rupture. Therefore, the next step in the diagnostic evaluation of this patient should be to look for evidence of aortic root dilatation or dissection, which would be best accomplished with an imaging study such as a chest radiograph (option B). 

Option A: Genetic testing could confirm the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, but it is not the first step because it will not identify the potentially life-threatening complication of aortic dissection. 

Option C: An angiogram would be an invasive procedure and is not necessary to diagnose an aortic dissection. 

Option D: An electrocardiogram is not the best initial test for suspected aortic dissection. It may show nonspecific findings or even normal results.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The picture provided here is suggestive of Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities (tall stature, high-arched feet, pectus excavatum), ocular abnormalities, and most importantly cardiovascular complications, most commonly aortic root dilatation and dissection. Patients may present with chest pain suggestive of acute aortic dissection, a life-threatening emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. The initial diagnostic test for suspected aortic dissection is a chest imaging study to visualize the aorta. Therefore, the correct answer is 'B': Chest radiograph.

Let's review why the other options are incorrect:

'A': Genetic testing - Although Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by a defect in the fibrillin-1 gene, genetic testing is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's acute presentation. It may be necessary for confirming the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome but is not the first step when an aortic dissection is suspected.

'C': Angiogram - While this procedure can provide a detailed view of the blood vessels and may identify an aortic dissection, it is invasive and not usually the first step in the diagnostic process.

'D': Electrocardiogram - An EKG is useful for diagnosing cardiac conditions such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and other heart abnormalities but is not the most appropriate test for evaluating a suspected aortic dissection.

'E': Serum blood test - Blood tests can provide a lot of useful information and may be used as part of the evaluation of a patient with suspected Marfan syndrome, especially to rule out other conditions, but they would not provide direct evidence of an aortic dissection. 

Therefore, given the patient's presentation and the likelihood of aortic dissection, a chest radiograph would be the most appropriate next step in this patient's care."
7724,"The patient's symptoms and findings suggest acute hemolytic anemia secondary to infection with parvovirus B19, a virus that preferentially infects erythroid progenitor cells and can cause transient aplastic crisis. The presence of small round inclusions within erythrocytes and several erythrocytes with semicircular indentations (Heinz bodies and bite cells, respectively) suggests a concurrent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. G6PD is a key enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway and is important for the generation of NADPH. NADPH is necessary for the regeneration of reduced glutathione, which neutralizes reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the erythrocyte. In the absence of G6PD, ROS accumulates and denatures hemoglobin, forming Heinz bodies. Splenic macrophages then remove these inclusions, leading to formation of bite cells. Therefore, the answer is A, 'Biosynthesis of glutathione.'

Option B, 'Generation of superoxide,' is incorrect as superoxide is a type of ROS that would cause more damage in the context of G6PD deficiency. Option C, 'Anchoring proteins to cell surface,' is incorrect as the anchoring of proteins to the cell surface is not affected in G6PD deficiency. Option D, 'Conversion of phosphoenolypyruvate,' is incorrect as this is a process in the glycolytic pathway and is not related to G6PD deficiency.

Option: {'A': 'Biosynthesis of glutathione', 'B': 'Generation of superoxide', 'C': 'Anchoring proteins to cell surface', 'D': 'Conversion of phosphoenolypyruvate', 'E': 'Function of myeloperoxidase'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's presentation of abdominal pain, dark urine, conjunctival pallor, scleral icterus, mild splenomegaly, and a peripheral blood smear showing inclusions within erythrocytes and semicircular indentations, suggest a diagnosis of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. This is a common X-linked recessive disorder characterized by episodes of hemolytic anemia in response to oxidative stress. Triggers can include infections (as in this patient), certain foods (eg, fava beans), and medications (eg, antimalarials, sulfonamides, dapsone). G6PD is involved in the pentose phosphate pathway and helps to prevent damage from reactive oxygen species by catalyzing the formation of NADPH. NADPH is necessary for the reduction of oxidized glutathione, a critical cellular antioxidant, back to its reduced form. Reduced glutathione neutralizes reactive oxygen species, preventing them from causing cellular damage.

Option A: 'Biosynthesis of glutathione' is the correct answer as G6PD deficiency impairs the body's ability to reduce oxidized glutathione back to its reduced form, making erythrocytes more susceptible to oxidative stress.

Option B: 'Generation of superoxide' is not affected by G6PD deficiency. Superoxide is generated by several processes including the mitochondrial electron transport chain and NADPH oxidase, not G6PD.

Option C: 'Anchoring proteins to cell surface' is not affected by G6PD deficiency.

Option D: 'Conversion of phosphoenolypyruvate' is part of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, not the pentose phosphate pathway or glutathione metabolism, and therefore is not related to G6PD deficiency.

Option E: 'Function of myeloperoxidase' is not related to G6PD deficiency. Myeloperoxidase is an enzyme found in neutrophils and monocytes that aids in microbial killing by generating hypochlorous acid from hydrogen peroxide and chloride anion. It is not involved in glutathione metabolism or the pentose phosphate pathway."
7819,"The correct answer is D: 'Abdominal ultrasound'.

This patient's presentation of unilateral leg pain, swelling, redness, warmth, and positive Homan's sign (calf pain with foot dorsiflexion) is suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). In addition, the ultrasound showing a non-compressible popliteal vein with reduced flow confirms this diagnosis. 

One common cause of DVT is malignancy, especially occult malignancies in older patients. Therefore, after starting anticoagulation for this patient's DVT, the next step is to screen for cancer, which is often done with an abdominal ultrasound to evaluate for common sources of cancer such as the liver, pancreas, and kidneys.

This patient's clinical presentation is consistent with deep venous thrombosis (DVT), which is confirmed by the compression ultrasonography with Doppler showing a non-compressible left popliteal vein with a visible 0.5-cm hyperechoic mass and reduced flow. His age and the absence of common risk factors for thromboembolism (e.g., surgery, trauma, malignancy, hypercoagulable state) suggest an occult malignancy (e.g., colon, pancreatic, stomach). In cancer patients, the hypercoagulable state is due to tumor cell release of procoagulant and fibrinolytic substances, and inflammatory cytokines, which increase platelet and clotting cascade activity. Given this patient's age and lack of symptoms suggestive of a specific cancer, a screening test for a common malignancy (e.g., colonoscopy for colorectal cancer) should be performed.

Option 'B': Inferior vena cava filter is incorrect. These are used for patients with DVT who have a contraindication to anticoagulation or recurrent embolism despite adequate anticoagulation.

7875,"The most likely cause of the urinary tract infection (UTI) in this patient is 'C': Proteus mirabilis. 

Proteus mirabilis is a gram-negative bacterium that is commonly associated with UTIs, especially in patients with structural abnormalities of the urinary tract or those with catheters. This bacterium has the ability to produce urease, an enzyme that converts urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide. This can result in an alkaline urine pH (greater than 7), as seen in this patient. An alkaline urine pH can lead to the formation of struvite stones (magnesium ammonium phosphate stones), which can cause symptoms of UTI including dysuria, frequency, and urgency.

The urease test being positive is indicative of a few bacteria that can cause UTIs, including Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. However, Proteus mirabilis is unique in that it can cause a change in urine pH to be more alkaline (as indicated by the pH of 7.5 in this patient), due to its ability to hydrolyze urea to ammonia.  This results in an alkaline urine, which can contribute to the formation of struvite stones (magnesium ammonium phosphate stones).

7876,"The clinical presentation of this patient is suggestive of a metabolic disorder affecting glycogenolysis. The history of symptoms with fasting, low serum glucose concentration, mild hepatomegaly and familial history are all consistent with a glycogen storage disease (GSD). GSDs are inherited metabolic disorders that result from defects in the processing of glycogen synthesis or breakdown. The boy's symptoms manifest during a prolonged fast (ie, skipping breakfast and not having snacks), when hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis become necessary for maintaining glucose homeostasis. 

In this case, the most likely diagnosis is von Gierke disease (GSD type I) which results from a deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase (Option D). This enzyme is crucial for the final step of both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis which is converting glucose-6-phosphate into glucose. Hence, its deficiency leads to fasting hypoglycemia, increased glycogen in the liver (leading to hepatomegaly), and increased blood levels of lactate, lipids, and uric acid.

This disease is caused by a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphatase (option D), which is normally responsible for the final step in both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. This enzyme deficiency leads to decreased glucose production and subsequent accumulation of glycogen in the liver and kidneys, resulting in the hepatomegaly seen in this patient.

This patient most likely has Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN) secondary to sepsis from pneumonia. ATN is the most common cause of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients. It's typically caused by renal ischemia (i.e. from sepsis) or nephrotoxic agents. The initial increase in Cr to 8.0 mg/dL indicates acute kidney injury. The subsequent decrease to 1.8 mg/dL demonstrates improvement but still indicates some renal dysfunction. In ATN, the renal tubules are damaged leading to sloughing off of cells and formation of casts. The most common type of cast seen in ATN is hyaline cast.

C. difficile is a gram-positive bacillus that forms spores, enabling it to survive in harsh conditions (eg, hospital environment) for prolonged periods. It is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, often via the hands of healthcare workers or by environmental contamination. Risk factors include antibiotic use (especially clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins), advanced age, and hospitalization/nursing home residence. The pathogenesis typically involves disruption of the normal colonic flora by antibiotics, followed by colonization with C. difficile. 

The organism produces toxins that induce inflammation and damage to the colonic mucosa, resulting in diarrhea. Gross examination of the colon may reveal the presence of pseudomembranes, which are yellowish plaques composed of inflammatory cells, mucus, and cellular debris. 

First-line treatment for an initial episode of C. difficile infection involves discontinuation of the inciting antibiotic, if possible, and initiation of oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin.

The patient's recurrent chest pain, palpitations, and dyspnea on exertion, coupled with a history of recent myocardial infarction and evidence of new ischemic changes on ECG (T-wave inversion), are suggestive of a recurrent myocardial infarction. The most reliable and specific test for rapidly establishing the diagnosis of myocardial infarction is the measurement of cardiac troponins (troponin T and I). Cardiac troponins are components of the contractile apparatus of myocardial cells and are released into the circulation when there is myocardial cell necrosis.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is 'C': 'Cardiac troponin T'.

This patient's chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea on exertion, and new T-wave inversion on ECG suggest a recurrence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The most reliable biomarker for rapidly establishing a diagnosis of ACS is cardiac troponin T, which is specific for myocardial damage and is released into the bloodstream following myocardial necrosis. It begins to rise 2-4 hours after the onset of myocardial infarction and remains elevated for 5-14 days, allowing for a wider diagnostic window.

As for the other options:
A) Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is not specific for cardiac damage and can be released in other conditions such as liver disease, hematologic disorders, and malignancies, making it less reliable in this context.
B) Creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) was previously used as a marker for myocardial injury, but has largely been replaced by troponin because CK-MB is less specific and can be elevated in skeletal muscle injury.
D) Copeptin is a marker that is often used in combination with troponin to rule out myocardial infarction, but it has less diagnostic value when used alone.
E) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) can be elevated in conditions involving liver, muscle, and red blood cells, making it less specific and reliable for diagnosing myocardial infarction."

8356,"The patient's history, clinical features, and physical examination findings are suggestive of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). This is characterized by asymmetric septal hypertrophy and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, leading to dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Symptoms are due to the dynamic obstruction and diastolic dysfunction. In HCM, the murmur intensity increases with maneuvers that decrease left ventricular size such as the Valsalva maneuver or standing from a squatting position, as they increase the outflow tract obstruction. 

The Valsalva maneuver consists of forceful attempted exhalation against a closed airway and is used medically to evaluate autonomic function of the heart and also to 'clear' the ears and sinuses (equalize pressure) when ambient pressure changes, as in diving or aviation. The physiology of the Valsalva maneuver can be divided into four phases:

Phase 1: Onset of strain, during which intrathoracic pressure rises and venous return decreases (preload drops). This leads to a small, transient increase in blood pressure.

Phase 2: Continued strain, where the decreased venous return leads to a drop in cardiac output and thus a drop in blood pressure. The body compensates by increasing sympathetic outflow, leading to an increase in heart rate and systemic vascular resistance.

Phase 3: Release of strain, which causes a sudden decrease in intrathoracic pressure and abrupt increase in venous return but a temporary decrease in arterial blood pressure.

Phase 4: Return to normal, during which the increased venous return restores cardiac output and blood pressure. The sympathetic response is withdrawn and parasympathetic activity causes a brief period of bradycardia.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 'Ã¢â? â?? Mean Arterial Pressure, Ã¢â? â?? Heart rate, Ã¢â? â?? Baroreceptor activity, Ã¢â? â??

The Valsalva maneuver decreases preload (or venous return), which in turn decreases the left ventricular end-diastolic volume. This results in an increase in the intensity of the murmur heard with HCM. 

The initial hemodynamic response during the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver (which involves forced expiration against a closed glottis) includes: decreased venous return as a result of increased intrathoracic pressure, which results in decreased stroke volume (due to the Frank-Starling mechanism), decreased cardiac output, and decreased mean arterial pressure.

The decrease in mean arterial pressure is sensed by baroreceptors located in the aortic arch and carotid sinus, which respond by decreasing their firing rate. This results in decreased parasympathetic outflow and increased sympathetic outflow, which in turn cause an increase in heart rate. 

Therefore, the answer is 'A': '? Mean Arterial Pressure, ? Heart rate, ? Baroreceptor activity, ? Parasympathetic Outflow'.

8363,"The correct answer is D, increased c-peptide levels.

Factitious disorder, also known as Munchausen syndrome, is a psychiatric disorder in which a person acts as if they have a physical or mental illness when they are not really sick. It often involves the patient intentionally producing or feigning symptoms. The key feature distinguishing factitious disorder from malingering (where patients feign illness for secondary gain, such as financial compensation or avoidance of work) is that patients with factitious disorder are motivated by a desire to be seen as ill or injured, not by external incentives.

In this case, the patient's hypoglycemia and the history of unexplained medical conditions suggest factitious disorder imposed on self with possible surreptitious insulin use. Insulin and c-peptide are co-secreted equimolarly by the pancreas. Thus, endogenous hyperinsulinemia (eg, insulinoma) would result in a high c-peptide level. Exogenous insulin use results in high insulin levels but low or normal c-peptide levels. Therefore, finding increased c-peptide levels despite hypoglycemia would be indicative of factitious disorder.

Option A: Increased anion gap would indicate metabolic acidosis, not a specific finding in factitious disorder.
Option B: Elevated troponin I and CK-MB levels would indicate myocardial infarction, not a specific finding in factitious disorder.
Option C: Normal c-peptide levels would be expected in exogenous insulin use, but not in factitious disorder where the patient is intentionally stimulating insulin secretion.

They are even willing to undergo painful or risky tests and operations in order to get the sympathy and special attention given to people who are truly ill. 

The presence of increased c-peptide levels is the correct answer for this patient (Choice D). C-peptide is co-secreted with insulin from the pancreas, and thus can be used as a marker for endogenous insulin production. In patients with factitious hypoglycemia due to self-administration of insulin, c-peptide levels will be low (since insulin is being supplied exogenously) while insulin levels will be high. The presence of high insulin and high c-peptide levels suggests that the patient's hypoglycemia is due to endogenous overproduction of insulin, which would be the case in an insulinoma, not factitious disorder.

This patient's symptoms of fatigue, back pain, dark urine, and yellow skin under his eyelids are indicative of jaundice, which is usually caused by an increased level of bilirubin in the blood. The fact that he has been traveling in Morocco and has dark urine suggests he may have contracted a type of hepatitis, which could lead to conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Option A: Absent urine bilirubin would not be expected because the presence of bilirubin in the urine is a cause of the dark urine this patient is experiencing.

Option B: Elevated urine bilirubin would be expected in this case, however, it is not the most likely finding. The bilirubin in urine would be conjugated, thus making the answer D more specific and more likely.

Option C: Decreased urine urobilinogen is not typically associated with hepatitis or jaundice. Urobilinogen is a product of bilirubin reduction by intestinal bacteria and its levels in urine can either decrease (as in biliary obstruction) or increase (as in intravascular hemolysis or liver disease).

Option E: Elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is another possible finding in hepatitis, but it is not as specific as conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Both AST and ALT levels can be elevated in a range of liver diseases, not just hepatitis. While the patient's symptoms could be consistent with a liver disease, the recent travel history to a developing country and exposure to potentially contaminated food or water make a viral hepatitis more likely.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's fatigue, back pain, dark urine, and yellow discoloration (jaundice) suggest a diagnosis of hepatitis. Given his recent travel in Morocco, hepatitis A should be strongly considered. Hepatitis A is transmitted fecal-orally, often through contaminated food or water. It can also be transmitted through sexual activity, particularly among men who have sex with men. 

The pathogenesis of hepatitis A begins with ingestion of the virus, which then travels to the liver where it replicates. The virus is then excreted into the bile and stool. As the virus replicates in hepatocytes, it induces a cellular immune response that results in hepatocyte necrosis and causes the clinical symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue and jaundice.

In the case of hepatitis, you would expect to see elevated urine bilirubin (Option B). During hepatitis, damage to the liver cells causes an increase in the levels of both conjugated (direct) and unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin in the blood. However, only conjugated bilirubin is water-soluble and can be excreted in the urine, leading to dark urine. 

Option A (Absent urine bilirubin) is incorrect because bilirubin levels would be elevated in the urine due to liver damage. 

Option C (Decreased urine urobilinogen) is incorrect. In hepatitis, there can actually be an increase in urobilinogen in the urine because the damaged liver is less able to process it.

Option D (Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia) could also be correct because, as mentioned earlier, both conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin levels can increase in hepatitis. However, the question specifically asks about findings in the urine, so elevated urine bilirubin (Option B) would be the most likely finding.

Option E (Elevated aspartate aminotransferase) could also be correct because liver enzymes such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) can be elevated in hepatitis due to liver damage. However, again, the question specifically asks about findings in the urine."

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's sleep disturbances, decreased energy, and trouble concentrating are symptoms of adjustment disorder, a psychological response to identifiable stressors (divorce in this case) causing emotional or behavioral symptoms. These symptoms arise within 3 months of the stressor onset (Option D). The diagnosis of adjustment disorder is made when the emotional or behavioral symptoms are out of proportion to what would be expected or cause significant impairment in social or occupational (work or school) functioning. Symptoms must resolve within 6 months of the stressor terminating (or within 6 months of the consequences of the stressor terminating, such as a divorce process). If symptoms persist beyond 6 months, another diagnosis (eg, major depressive disorder) should be considered. Treatment includes psychotherapy and, when needed (eg, significant anxiety or depressive symptoms), pharmacotherapy.

Option A is incorrect. Symptoms of adjustment disorder do not typically wax and wane, and must resolve within 6 months of the stressor (or its consequences) terminating. Option B is incorrect. Although cognitive impairment can occur in adjustment disorder, the diagnosis is not made based on any cognitive impairment but rather on emotional or behavioral symptoms. Option C is incorrect. Symptoms of adjustment disorder may be persistent, but they must resolve within 6 months of the termination of the stressor or its consequences. Option E is incorrect. Symptoms of adjustment disorder are usually self-limited, but they do not typically persist for 2 years. If symptoms persist for more than 6 months after the termination of the stressor or its consequences, another diagnosis should be considered."
8415,"The plasma concentration of a substance can be calculated if the clearance and the excretion rate of that substance are known. Clearance is a measure of the volume of plasma completely cleared of a substance per unit time and is calculated as the Excretion rate (mg/min) divided by the Plasma concentration (mg/mL). Therefore, the plasma concentration can be calculated as the Excretion rate divided by Clearance.

In this case, the excretion rate of Compound X is given as 300 mg/min. The clearance of Compound X can be calculated from the information given about inulin and PAH. Inulin is freely filtered in the glomeruli and does not undergo secretion or reabsorption in the renal tubules, so its clearance reflects the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is given as 120 mL/min. PAH is both freely filtered and secreted, but not reabsorbed, so its clearance represents the renal plasma flow (RPF), which is given as 600 mL/min. As Compound X is both filtered and secreted, its clearance is the sum of the GFR and the tubular secretion rate. 

The tubular secretion rate of Compound X is given as 60 mg/min. Since the plasma concentration of PAH is 0.2 mg/mL and its clearance is 600 mL/min, the amount of PAH being secreted can be calculated as the clearance minus the amount being filtered (GFR), i.e., 600 mL/min - 120 mL/min = 480 mL/min. Therefore, since 480 mL/min of PAH corresponds to 60 mg/min of Compound X, the secretion rate of Compound X is 480 mL/min.

Therefore, the clearance of Compound X = GFR + secretion rate = 120 mL/min + 480 mL/min = 600 mL/min.

The plasma concentration of Compound X can then be calculated as the excretion rate divided by the clearance = 300 mg/min Ã· 600 mL/min = 0.5 mg/mL.

Therefore, the answer is option 'A': 0.5 mg/mL.

Option 'B': 1 mg/mL, 'C': 2 mg/mL, and 'D': 3 mg/mL are incorrect because they do not result from the calculations based on the given data.

Option 'E': 'There is insufficient information available to estimate the plasma concentration of Compound X' is incorrect because there is enough information provided to perform the necessary calculations.","stop","therefore, the answer is option 'a': 0.5 mg/ml.","A","C","USMLE question: A patient is receiving daily administrations of Compound X. Compound X is freely filtered in the glomeruli and undergoes net secretion in the renal tubules. The majority of this tubular secretion occurs in the distal convoluted tubule. Additional information regarding this patientÃ¢â?¬â?¢s renal function and the renal processing of Compound X is included below:

Inulin clearance: 120 mL/min
Plasma concentration of Inulin: 1 mg/mL
PAH clearance: 600 mL/min
Plasma concentration of PAH: 0.2 mg/mL
Total Tubular Secretion of Compound X: 60 mg/min
Net Renal Excretion of Compound X: 300 mg/min

Which of the following is the best estimate of the plasma concentration of Compound X in this patient?
Option: {'A': '0.5 mg/mL', 'B': '1 mg/mL', 'C': '2 mg/mL', 'D': '3 mg/mL', 'E': 'There is insufficient information available to estimate the plasma concentration of Compound X'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The plasma concentration of Compound X can be estimated using the renal clearance formula: Clearance = Excretion rate/Plasma concentration. 

We know the excretion rate of Compound X is 300 mg/min, so we can plug that into the formula and solve for the plasma concentration. 

However, the clearance of a substance that undergoes net secretion (like Compound X in this question) is not simply the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), but rather the GFR plus an additional component due to secretion. 

The clearance of Compound X is equal to the inulin clearance (which primarily measures GFR) plus the additional clearance due to tubular secretion. Inulin clearance is provided as 120 mL/min, and we can estimate the additional clearance due to tubular secretion by dividing the total secretion of Compound X (60 mg/min) by the plasma concentration of PAH (0.2 mg/mL), since PAH is primarily secreted in the renal tubules. 

This gives us an additional clearance of 60 mg/min / 0.2 mg/mL = 300 mL/min. 

So, the total clearance of Compound X is 120 mL/min + 300 mL/min = 420 mL/min. 

We can now plug this clearance value and the excretion rate of Compound X into our formula and solve for the plasma concentration: 300 mg/min / 420 mL/min = 0.71 mg/mL. 

The closest answer choice to this value is 0.5 mg/mL, so the answer is 'A'. 

The other options are incorrect because they give plasma concentrations that would not result in the provided excretion rate when plugged into the renal clearance formula with our calculated clearance value. For example, a plasma concentration of 1 mg/mL would result in an excretion rate of 420 mg/min, not the 300 mg/min that was provided."
8426,"The correct answer is C. Hepatitis A vaccination.

This patient has chronic hepatitis C infection, as indicated by positive anti-HCV and HCV RNA tests. Her positive hepatitis B surface antibody indicates prior hepatitis B vaccination or infection, but negative hepatitis B core antibody and surface antigen tests indicate that she has recovered from hepatitis B infection and is not currently infected. Given that she is not immune to hepatitis A (anti-HAV is negative), vaccination is recommended. 

Hepatitis A superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B or C can result in a severe course of hepatitis A, including acute liver failure. Therefore, all individuals with chronic liver disease (including hepatitis C, regardless of fibrosis/cirrhosis status) should be vaccinated against hepatitis A if they are not already immune.

Now, why are the other options incorrect? 

Option A: Interferon-Î± and ribavirin are both contraindicated in pregnancy due to their teratogenic effects. 

Option B: Liver biopsy is not typically required to diagnose or manage hepatitis C. It may be used in select cases to assess the degree of liver fibrosis but is not indicated in this case.

Option D: Cesarean delivery is not routinely recommended for women with hepatitis C, as the risk of vertical transmission is not reduced by cesarean section.

Option E: The patient's hepatitis B surface antibody is positive, which means her newborn will be protected by the passive transfer of antibodies and does not require HBV vaccination or HBIG at birth.","stop","the correct answer is c. hepatitis a vaccination.","C","C","USMLE question: A 34-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 0, at 28 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a prenatal visit. She has not had regular prenatal care. Her most recent ultrasound at 20 weeks of gestation confirmed accurate fetal dates and appropriate fetal development. She takes levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. She used to work as a nurse before she emigrated from Brazil 13 years ago. She lost her immunization records during the move and cannot recall all of her vaccinations. She appears well. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a fundal height of 26 cm and no abnormalities. An ELISA test for HIV is negative. Serology testing for hepatitis B surface antibody and hepatitis C antibody are both positive. Hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis A antibody are negative. Polymerase chain reaction of hepatitis C RNA is positive for genotype 1. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation at this time?
Option: {'A': 'Start combination therapy with interferon Ã?Â± and ribavirin', 'B': 'Undergo liver biopsy', 'C': 'Hepatitis A vaccination', 'D': 'Schedule a cesarean delivery', 'E': 'Plan to give hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B Ig to the newborn'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is E. 'Plan to give hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B Ig to the newborn'

This woman's serologic testing reveals past infection with hepatitis B (as evidenced by positive hepatitis B core antibody and negative surface antigen) and chronic hepatitis C infection (as evidenced by positive hepatitis C antibody and RNA). Hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be transmitted from mother to child; the risk is highest among mothers with high viral loads and those coinfected with HIV. However, current guidelines do not recommend cesarean delivery (Choice D) to reduce the risk of transmission of HCV. Treatment with interferon a and ribavirin (Choice A) is contraindicated during pregnancy because ribavirin is teratogenic, and interferon is abortifacient. Liver biopsy (Choice B) is also contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of bleeding.

Because this woman had past hepatitis B infection but is no longer immune (negative hepatitis B surface antibody), it is possible that her newborn can contract hepatitis B from environmental exposure (eg, household contacts). The newborn should therefore receive hepatitis B immunoglobulin and the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth. The hepatitis B vaccine series should then be completed as per the recommended schedule.

Hepatitis A vaccination (Choice C) is not indicated solely based on a positive hepatitis C status. It is recommended for persons with chronic liver disease (including hepatitis C infection), but more information would be necessary to make this determination in this patient."
8440,"The most appropriate next step in the management for this woman is 'D': Labetalol. 

This patient has chronic hypertension, defined as hypertension that is present before pregnancy or diagnosed before 20 weeks' gestation. Chronic hypertension is associated with increased risk of superimposed preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, placental abruption, and preterm delivery. Pregnant patients with blood pressure (BP) >160/105 mm Hg should be treated due to the risk of maternal end-organ damage. For patients with BP <160/105 mm Hg, the benefits of treatment are less clear. However, treatment should be considered in those with co-existing conditions that may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (eg, diabetes, kidney disease). 

Medications that are safe for use in pregnancy include methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine. Of these, methyldopa and labetalol are considered first-line agents. In this case, either labetalol or methyldopa could be appropriate. 

Option A (Fosinopril) is incorrect because ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnancy due to their association with fetal renal dysgenesis, oligohydramnios, and skull hypoplasia. 

Option B (Magnesium sulfate) is not correct because it is used in the acute management of severe preeclampsia or eclampsia to prevent seizures, but it is not used for long-term BP control in chronic hypertension.

Option C (Methyldopa) could also be an appropriate choice, but labetalol is often preferred due to a better side effect profile.

Option E (No medications needed) is incorrect because, given her history of preeclampsia and current chronic hypertension, the patient is at an increased risk of developing superimposed preeclampsia, and thus should be managed with antihypertensive medications.","stop","the most appropriate next step in the management for this woman is 'd': labetalol.","D","E","USMLE question: A 37-year-old woman presents to her physician with a newly detected pregnancy for the initial prenatal care visit.

8444,"The correct answer is 'C': Neutrophils. 

The patient's blood cultures reveal yeast with pseudohyphae, which is indicative of a Candida infection. Candida species are a type of fungus that can cause infections in humans, particularly in individuals with impaired immunity. Neutrophils are a key component of the immune response against fungal infections like Candida. They are able to phagocytose (engulf and destroy) the organism. A deficiency or dysfunction in neutrophils can therefore lead to an increased susceptibility to these types of infections.

Option 'A': T-cells are primarily involved in cell-mediated immunity and are crucial for fighting off viral and intracellular bacterial infections. They wouldn't be the primary defense against a Candida infection.

Option 'B': B-cells produce antibodies as part of the humoral immune response. They're important for fighting off extracellular bacterial and viral infections, not fungal infections like Candida.

Option 'D': Eosinophils are primarily involved in combating parasitic infections and modulating allergic inflammatory responses. They would not be the key cell type fighting a Candida infection.

Option 'E': Although phagocytes (a category that includes neutrophils) are involved in the response to a Candida infection, this answer is less specific than 'neutrophils.'

T-cells play a crucial role in cell-mediated immunity by recognizing and destroying infected cells, stimulating other immune cells to participate in the immune response, and modulating the immune response to prevent excessive damage.

B-cells (option B) are involved in humoral immunity and produce antibodies that can neutralize pathogens. Although this is an important part of the immune response, it is not the primary defense against invasive candidiasis.

8452,"This patient's age, new headache, scalp tenderness, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and systemic symptoms (fever, hip and shoulder stiffness) are suggestive of giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis. GCA is a vasculitis that primarily affects medium- and large-sized arteries, most often the branches of the carotid artery. The inflammation of the arterial wall can cause luminal narrowing or occlusion. When the ophthalmic artery is involved, it can lead to irreversible blindness, which can occur rapidly. Therefore, the most important next step in the management of a patient with suspected GCA is to start high-dose glucocorticoids (oral prednisone) to prevent vision loss (Option D). Temporal artery biopsy can confirm the diagnosis, but it should not delay the treatment.

8470,"The correct answer is D: Increased action potential refractory period.

This mutation is affecting a voltage-gated sodium channel, which is crucial for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in neurons. Under normal conditions, the opening of these channels allows sodium to enter the cell, causing depolarization and the initiation of an action potential. However, these channels then rapidly inactivate, preventing further sodium entry and allowing for the propagation of the action potential down the neuron. 

The mutation described in this question causes the sodium channels to inactivate more rapidly than normal. This would mean that the channels close more quickly after opening, reducing the amount of time that sodium can enter the cell. This would, in turn, increase the refractory period - the time during which a second action potential cannot be initiated - because it would take longer for the sodium channels to recover from inactivation and be ready to open again.

The other options are incorrect because they involve changes that are not consistent with the effect of the mutation described in the question. 

Option A: Decreased action potential amplitude - The amplitude of an action potential is largely determined by the sodium concentration gradient across the cell membrane, which would not be affected by this mutation.

Option B: Decreased hyperpolarization potential - Hyperpolarization occurs after an action potential, when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. This is caused by the movement of potassium ions out of the cell, not sodium ions.

Option C: Decreased resting membrane potential - The resting membrane potential is primarily determined by the potassium ion gradient, not the sodium gradient. Thus, this mutation in a sodium channel would not likely affect the resting membrane potential.

Option E: Increased threshold for action potential activation - The threshold for action potential activation is the membrane potential at which enough voltage-gated sodium channels open to cause an action potential. This would not be directly affected by the rate of sodium channel inactivation.","stop","the correct answer is d: increased action potential refractory period.","D","A","USMLE question: A scientist is studying patients with neuromuscular weakness and discovers a mutation in a plasma membrane ion channel.

She continues to examine the mutant channel and finds that it is more rapidly inactivated compared with the wildtype channel. Which of the following effects would this mutant channel most likely have on the electrical profile of neurons in these patients?
Option: {'A': 'Decreased action potential amplitude', 'B': 'Decreased hyperpolarization potential', 'C': 'Decreased resting membrane potential', 'D': 'Increased action potential refractory period', 'E': 'Increased threshhold for action potential activation'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The answer is D: 'Increased action potential refractory period'

This question describes a mutation that increases the rate of sodium channel inactivation. Sodium channels have two gates: the activation gate and the inactivation gate. Normally, when the cell depolarizes, the activation gate opens quickly allowing sodium to rush into the cell, which generates the rising phase of the action potential. Then, a bit slower, the inactivation gate closes, stopping the flow of sodium into the cell. This closure contributes to the falling phase of the action potential and the beginning of the refractory period, during which the neuron can't generate another action potential. 

If the mutation causes the inactivation gate to close more rapidly, this would end the rising phase of the action potential sooner and start the refractory period sooner. Thus, the neuron would have a longer refractory period where it can't generate another action potential, which is option D.

Option A is incorrect because the mutation is unlikely to decrease the action potential amplitude. This is determined by the sodium concentration gradient across the membrane, which the question states is normal.

Option B is incorrect because hyperpolarization potential is determined by the delayed opening of potassium channels, which isn't affected by this mutation.

Option C is incorrect because the resting membrane potential is determined by the potassium concentration gradient, which is normal according to the question.

Option E is incorrect because the threshold for action potential activation is determined by the number of sodium channels that are available to open, which wouldn't be affected by this mutation. The mutation affects how quickly the channels close, not how many are available to open."
8471,"The correct answer is B: Mainstem bronchi.

In the respiratory tree, the highest resistance to airflow occurs in the mid-sized airways, particularly the mainstem bronchi. While intuitively it may seem like smaller airways, such as bronchioles, would offer more resistance, the branching architecture of the airways means that there are many more small airways than large ones. Therefore, the resistance of each individual small airway is summed over a large number of parallel pathways, which results in a lower total resistance. 

In contrast, there is only one pathway for air through each of the two mainstem bronchi, so their resistance makes a more significant contribution to the total airway resistance. 

As for the other options:

A: Respiratory bronchioles: These are smaller airways that are numerous and in parallel, offering less total resistance as explained above.

C: Segmental bronchi: These, although larger than bronchioles, are still smaller than the mainstem bronchi and are also more numerous, offering less total resistance.

D: Conducting bronchioles: These are smaller airways that are numerous and in parallel, offering less total resistance as explained above.

E: Terminal bronchioles: These are the smallest airways prior to the respiratory zone and, while they have a high resistance individually, their overall contribution to total airway resistance is lower due to their high number and parallel arrangement.","stop","the correct answer is b: mainstem bronchi.","B","C","USMLE question: A 21-year-old lacrosse player comes to the doctor for an annual health assessment.

Whole body plethysmography is performed to measure airway resistance. Which of the following structures of the respiratory tree is likely to have the highest contribution to total airway resistance?
Option: {'A': 'Respiratory bronchioles', 'B': 'Mainstem bronchi', 'C': 'Segmental bronchi', 'D': 'Conducting bronchioles', 'E': 'Terminal bronchioles'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The answer is B: Mainstem bronchi. 

The mainstem bronchi carry the highest total airway resistance in the respiratory tree. The principle of airway resistance is based on Poiseuille's law, which states that resistance is directly proportional to the length and viscosity of the tube and inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius. This means that small changes in the radius of the tube (in this case, the bronchus) can significantly impact resistance. 

Although the diameter of the individual bronchioles (Terminal (E), Conducting (D), and Respiratory (A)) is smaller than that of the mainstem bronchi, their combined cross-sectional area is much larger due to their greater number. As a result, the resistance in these areas is lower. 

The segmental bronchi (C) also contribute to the total airway resistance but to a lesser extent than the mainstem bronchi. 

In certain diseases like asthma, which primarily affects the bronchioles, the site of greatest resistance may shift from the mainstem bronchi to the bronchioles. However, in a healthy individual, the mainstem bronchi contribute most to airway resistance."

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is B, Digital clubbing. 

Lung cancer, like squamous cell carcinoma, is one of the most common causes of digital clubbing. Clubbing, or hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, is characterized by enlarged fingertips and nails that curve around the fingertips. The exact mechanism is unknown, but it is thought to be due to the release of platelet-derived growth factor and other mediators that lead to vascular dilatation and changes in the connective tissues. It is often associated with malignancies, especially lung cancer. 

Option A, Polydipsia, is typically seen in diabetes mellitus, not lung cancer. Option C, Superior vena cava syndrome, could be caused by a lung cancer, but it is not the most common symptom. It is a medical emergency characterized by facial swelling, distension of neck veins, and shortness of breath. Option D, Anisocoria (unequal pupil sizes), and E, Lateral gaze palsy, are neurological findings that may be found in various brain lesions, but they are not typically associated with lung cancer."
8494,"The correct answer is E: Factor IX. The patient's presentation of prolonged bleeding following a dental procedure is suggestive of a coagulation factor deficiency. Given that the patient's brother has a similar history and that the condition is X-linked recessive, the most likely diagnosis is Hemophilia B, also known as Christmas disease. Hemophilia B is due to a deficiency in Factor IX. It is less common than Hemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency), but the two conditions are clinically indistinguishable. 

Option A: Hemophilia A, caused by Factor VIII deficiency, is also a possibility given the clinical scenario. However, the question specifically states that genetic analysis confirmed an X-linked recessive disorder, therefore, Factor IX deficiency (Hemophilia B) is more likely.

Option B: Von Willebrand Factor deficiency causes von Willebrand disease, which is the most common inherited bleeding disorder, but it's not X-linked recessive; it's typically autosomal dominant.

Option C: Factor XI deficiency, also known as hemophilia C, is not typically associated with an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance.

Alport syndrome is an X-linked (in 85% of cases) disorder characterized by glomerulonephritis, end-stage kidney disease, and hearing loss. It is caused by mutations in the genes encoding alpha-3, alpha-4, and alpha-5 chains of type IV collagen, which is a major component of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). The resultant GBM is irregular and split (Choice E). Patients usually present with microscopic hematuria during childhood, which progresses to proteinuria and chronic kidney disease. Because the GBM is also a major component of the cochlea and eye, these patients can also have sensorineural deafness and various ocular abnormalities (eg, lens dislocation, posterior cataracts, corneal dystrophy).

Standing for long periods of time (Choice A) can cause orthostatic (postural) proteinuria, a benign condition that presents as proteinuria only when the patient is upright. It is the most common cause of asymptomatic proteinuria in adolescents and young adults.

TMBD (Option E) is the most common cause of isolated microscopic hematuria and is often discovered incidentally in healthy adolescents or young adults during routine urinalysis. TMBD results from diffuse thinning of the glomerular basement membrane due to mutations in type IV collagen, a major component of the basement membrane. Clinically, most affected individuals have a benign course characterized by persistent or intermittent microscopic hematuria with/without mild proteinuria. Even though this patient has no hematuria, it can be intermittent and may not be detected at each urinalysis. TMBD is often associated with a family history of hematuria and end-stage renal disease but can also appear sporadically. Rarely, patients with TMBD can have sensorineural hearing loss, as seen in this patient.

Seven hours after treatment, the patient is found to be confused, complaining of a severe headache, and has a slow, irregular pulse. This clinical picture is highly suggestive of cerebral edema, a rare but serious complication of DKA treatment in children and young adults. Cerebral edema most often occurs 4-12 hours after treatment initiation and presents with a decline in the level of consciousness (eg, confusion, abnormal behavior), headache, and slowing of the heart rate (bradycardia).

On examination, papilledema (D) may be noted due to increased intracranial pressure. The other options are less likely because pupillary constriction (A) is not a feature of cerebral edema, and hypoglycemia (B) can be ruled out as the cause of his symptoms because he is receiving IV glucose.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's initial presentation of hyperglycemia, acidemia, ketonemia, and an anion gap metabolic acidosis is consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is managed by administering intravenous fluids, insulin, and electrolyte repletion as needed (eg, potassium). Although there is debate over the utility of administering sodium bicarbonate in DKA, it is typically given when the pH is <7.0. However, this patient's bicarbonate administration was associated with an intracellular shift of potassium (H+ moves out of cells and K+ moves in to maintain electroneutrality) and a subsequent drop in serum potassium. Reduced serum potassium levels can cause hyperpolarization of cardiac muscle cells, decreasing their excitability and leading to bradycardia (pulse 50/min). The classic EKG findings of hypokalemia (Option A: U waves, T wave flattening) may also be present, but the peer-reviewed literature does not currently support Option A (pupillary constriction) as a sign of hypokalemia. 

Hypoglycemia (Option B) can occur during the treatment of DKA due to the administration of insulin. However, confusion and headache are nonspecific symptoms and do not definitively indicate hypoglycemia.

8549,"The correct answer is E. 'Increased right ventricular preload'. This patient's leg cramps, calf tenderness, and edema suggest deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The recent onset of dyspnea, tachycardia, and rales over the lung base suggest that she has had a pulmonary embolism (PE), most likely secondary to the DVT. PE is caused by a thrombus that originates in the venous system (usually from the lower extremities) and embolizes to the pulmonary arteries. This increases the resistance to pulmonary blood flow and leads to an increase in right ventricular (RV) afterload. If the increase in RV afterload is severe (as in the case of a large PE), the RV dilates and impairs the left ventricular (LV) filling by shifting the interventricular septum toward the LV, which eventually leads to a decrease in cardiac output and systemic hypotension. This process is known as acute cor pulmonale. However, as the preload of the RV increases (due to backflow of blood), it leads to a compensatory increase in cardiac output, which is likely to be the mechanism in this patient.

Option A, 'Decreased alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient', is incorrect because PE typically causes an increased A-a gradient due to ventilation-perfusion mismatch.

Option B, 'Decreased physiologic dead space', is incorrect. PE would actually increase physiological dead space as there is ventilation to these areas but no perfusion.

Option C, 'Secretion of vasodilating neurohumoral substances in pulmonary vascular bed', is incorrect because PE typically causes vasoconstriction in the pulmonary vasculature due to hypoxia.

Option D, 'Alveolar hyperventilation', is incorrect.

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increases the risk of thromboembolic events, thus is a significant risk factor in this case.

The most likely contributing mechanism to the pathophysiology of her condition is option E: ""Increased right ventricular preload."" A pulmonary embolism (PE) is a blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries in the lungs, usually due to blood clots that travel to the lungs from the legs or, rarely, other parts of the body (deep vein thrombosis). This blockage can increase the pressure on the right side of the heart (increased right ventricular preload), cause parts of the lung to be unventilated (leading to V/Q mismatch and hypoxemia), and lead to right heart failure.

Option A: The alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient would be increased, not decreased, because perfusion of the lung is reduced due to the blockage.

Option B: The physiologic dead space would be increased, not decreased, because areas of the lung are being ventilated but not perfused due to blockage.

Option C: While some vasodilating substances may be secreted in response to the embolism, this is not the primary pathophysiologic mechanism in acute PE.

Other signs of virilization may include acne, increased muscle bulk, and amenorrhea. In contrast, polycystic ovary syndrome typically presents with chronic symptoms such as menstrual irregularities, infertility, and hirsutism, but without virilization.

CHF in the setting of chronic hypertension usually occurs due to left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction, which is the heart's inability to fill properly during diastole. As the condition progresses, systolic function may also become impaired. 

Ejection fraction is a measurement of the percentage of blood leaving your heart each time it contracts. Normal ejection fraction ranges from 55% to 70%. 

So, the most likely echocardiographic finding in this patient would be ""Option A: Ejection fraction: 40% with increased left ventricular wall thickness"". The reduced ejection fraction indicates systolic dysfunction, and the increased ventricular wall thickness is consistent with long-standing hypertension leading to left ventricular hypertrophy.

Option B, C, E all show normal or high ejection fractions, which would not be consistent with this patient's likely systolic dysfunction due to CHF. 

Option D suggests dilated cardiomyopathy with thin walls, which is not typically associated with long-standing hypertension and the symptoms presented by the patient.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's irregularly irregular pulse, along with her signs of heart failure (bibasilar rales, distended jugular veins, lower extremity edema), suggest the diagnosis of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) with heart failure, possibly due to AF-related tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy is a common cause of a dilated cardiomyopathy and is typically seen in patients with inadequately rate-controlled AF (prolonged resting heart rate >110/min). The mechanism of cardiomyopathy in this setting is likely related to inadequate ventricular filling time and/or direct myocardial damage. As with other causes of dilated cardiomyopathy, the echocardiogram shows dilated chambers and systolic dysfunction (EF <50%) with normal or thin walls, hence option D 'Ejection fraction: 55% with dilated chambers and thin walls' is the most likely finding.

Option A 'Ejection fraction: 40% with increased left ventricular wall thickness' is indicative of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is not consistent with the findings in this patient. Option B 'Ejection fraction: 60% with normal left ventricular wall thickness' is indicative of normal cardiac function, which is inconsistent with this patient's presentation. Option C 'Ejection fraction: 80% with regurgitant aortic valve' is indicative of aortic regurgitation, which the patient does not have clinical signs of.

8616,"The correct answer is B: Vagus.

This patient's presentation is consistent with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), a condition often due to an abnormal conduction pathway in the heart. SVT can cause symptoms like a racing heartbeat, palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, and lightheadedness. Certain maneuvers, like the Valsalva maneuver or carotid sinus massage, can stimulate the vagus nerve and increase parasympathetic activity, which can in turn slow the heart rate.

The vagus nerve (option B) is the main parasympathetic nerve supplying the heart, and increased vagal tone can slow the heart rate. This is why maneuvers that stimulate the vagus nerve can help to terminate episodes of SVT.

The other options are incorrect because they do not have the same role in regulating heart rate:

Option A, the hypoglossal nerve, is primarily responsible for tongue movements.

Option C, the trigeminal nerve, is primarily involved in facial sensation and mastication.

Option D, the glossopharyngeal nerve, is involved in sensation from the pharynx and taste from the posterior third of the tongue, but it does not have a significant role in heart rate regulation.

This patient's presentation of rapid heart rate (tachycardia) that is terminated with a neck maneuver is suggestive of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). This is a common form of arrhythmia that can cause symptoms such as palpitations, light-headedness, and shortness of breath. One of the first-line treatments for PSVT is the use of vagal maneuvers, such as the Valsalva maneuver or carotid sinus massage, which increase parasympathetic output to the heart via the vagus nerve, thereby slowing the heart rate.

The other options are incorrect because they are not as directly responsible for slowing the heart rate:

A: The hypoglossal nerve is primarily involved in tongue movement, and does not have a significant role in regulating heart rate.

C: The trigeminal nerve primarily provides sensory innervation to the face and motor innervation to the muscles of mastication, and does not play a significant role in regulating heart rate. 

D: The glossopharyngeal nerve carries a variety of sensory and motor information related to the throat and taste, but plays a less direct role in modulating heart rate in comparison to the vagus nerve.

In contrast, Cushing disease (pituitary adenoma) would fully suppress, and an adrenal tumor would not suppress at all.

Thus, the next step in the management of this patient should be localizing the source of ectopic ACTH production. Because he is a long-time smoker, a common source of ectopic ACTH is small cell lung cancer. Therefore, a chest CT scan is the appropriate next step in his evaluation (Option A).

Sheehan syndrome can cause partial or complete pituitary insufficiency. The most susceptible cells are GH-producing somatotrophs and gonadotrophs, followed by corticotrophs which produce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Because ACTH is a major stimulus for adrenal cortisol synthesis, low ACTH levels in Sheehan syndrome cause low cortisol levels. Aldosterone secretion, however, is mainly regulated by the renin-angiotensin system and is therefore typically normal in patients with hypopituitarism. This explains option E: ? ACTH, normal Aldosterone, ? Cortisol.

The other options are incorrect:
A - ? ACTH, ? Aldosterone, ? Cortisol: This pattern could be seen in primary adrenal insufficiency (eg, Addison disease), but not Sheehan syndrome.
B - ? ACTH, normal Aldosterone, ? Cortisol: This pattern is not typically identified in any endocrine disorder.
C - ? ACTH, normal Aldosterone, ? Cortisol: This pattern could be seen in Cushing disease (pituitary adenoma), but not Sheehan syndrome.
D - ? ACTH, ? Aldosterone, ? Cortisol: This pattern is not typical for any endocrine disorder."
8712,"The answer is B. Monomers. 

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is the most abundant antibody isotype in the blood and is the major defense against invading pathogens. IgG is a monomeric antibody, meaning it consists of a single immunoglobulin unit. IgG is produced after initial exposure to a pathogen and is responsible for long-term immunity to that pathogen.

Option A (Dimers) represents IgA, which is predominantly found in mucosal secretions and provides immunity at mucosal surfaces. Option C (Pentamers) represents IgM, which is the first antibody produced in response to an initial exposure to an antigen but it is usually not produced until several days into the infection, so it is unlikely to be the predominant antibody form at this stage of the patientâ??s infection.

He has otherwise been healthy and has had all the required vaccines as scheduled. He is currently taking introductory biology as part of his premedical studies and recently learned about antibodies. He therefore asks his physician about what his body is doing to fight off the infection. At this stage of his infection, which of the following forms are the antibodies circulating in his serum?
Option: {'A': 'Dimers', 'B': 'Monomers', 'C': 'Pentamers', 'D': 'Tetramers', 'E': 'Trimers'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer here would be 'B': Monomers.

The main antibody circulating in the blood, especially during primary immune responses, is Immunoglobulin M (IgM). However, its structure is a pentamer, not a monomer. The antibody that exists as a monomer in serum is Immunoglobulin G (IgG). During early stages of infection, the immune system primarily produces IgM, but this case is a bit different. Mycoplasma infections are primarily fought off by IgM, and later by IgG. However, given that this infection is at an early stage (only 1 day of fever), the immune response would primarily be of the IgM type. 

In this case, the student has likely been exposed to his roommate's Mycoplasma infection and now his immune system is responding to that exposure. During the early response to an infection, IgM antibodies are produced first, followed by IgG antibodies. However, IgM is a pentamer in the bloodstream (option 'C'), not a monomer. 

The correct answer should have been 'C': Pentamers. But in absence of this option, the closest answer would be 'B': Monomers, because IgG exists as a monomer and will be the subsequent immune response, despite not being the primary response in early infection. 

Regarding the other options:

'A': Dimers. This is the structure of secretory IgA antibodies, which are found predominantly in mucous membranes and secretions, not in serum.

'D': Tetramers. No immunoglobulin exists as tetramers in serum, this is not an accurate form for antibodies in serum.

'E': Trimers. Antibodies do not circulate in the serum as trimers."

Compensatory hyperinsulinemia occurs when insulin resistance leads to higher levels of insulin production to maintain normal glucose levels. Excessive insulin can also cause early onset of puberty by acting on the ovaries to stimulate androgen production, leading to premature adrenarche and thelarche (the onset of pubic hair and breast development), thus explaining our patient's Tanner stages.

Candidal endocarditis is a rare but serious infection that is virtually exclusive to immunocompromised patients, such as this HIV positive patient with a CD4 count of 98, which indicates severe immunosuppression. Candidal endocarditis is also seen in patients with indwelling intravascular devices, intravenous drug users, and patients undergoing abdominal surgery.

Although these infections are more common in immunocompromised individuals, they are not exclusive to this group, and therefore, they are not the correct answer. 

Oral thrush presents as creamy white plaques on the buccal mucosa, tongue, or oropharynx. Candidal vaginitis presents with pruritus, burning, dyspareunia, and a thick, white, ""cottage cheeseâ??like"" vaginal discharge.

8731,"This patient's palpitations, hypertension, and hypokalemia suggest primary hyperaldosteronism, also known as Conn's syndrome. Aldosterone increases sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion, leading to hypertension and hypokalemia. Increased aldosterone can also activate the atria, leading to palpitations due to premature atrial complexes. Additionally, aldosterone causes hydrogen ion secretion, which may result in metabolic alkalosis (as suggested by this patient's elevated bicarbonate level).

Primary hyperaldosteronism can be due to an adrenal adenoma (aldosterone-producing adenoma, or APA) or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (idiopathic hyperaldosteronism, or IHA). APA accounts for about 30% of cases and is usually unilateral, while IHA accounts for about 60% of cases and is bilateral. Differentiating between the two is important because APA is treated with surgery (adrenalectomy), whereas IHA is treated medically (with spironolactone or eplerenone).

The saline infusion test, option E, is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism. In this test, intravenous saline is infused over 4 hours to suppress aldosterone secretion. Failure to suppress aldosterone suggests primary hyperaldosteronism.

A CT scan of the abdomen, option B, is performed after biochemical confirmation of primary hyperaldosteronism to localize the disease (APA versus IHA). This test is not the first step following laboratory confirmation.

The dexamethasone suppression test, option D, is used for the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome, not primary hyperaldosteronism.

Performing an adrenalectomy, option A, without further testing would be inappropriate and potentially harmful if the patient has IHA, which is bilateral and not typically treated with surgery.

Lastly, measuring urine pH and anion gap, option C, would be more appropriate in the evaluation of metabolic acidosis.

Primary hyperaldosteronism (PA) is a common, treatable cause of secondary hypertension and should be considered in any patient with resistant hypertension, spontaneous or diuretic-induced hypokalemia, or an adrenal incidentaloma. The initial diagnostic approach includes measurement of plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin activity. If PA is suspected, confirmatory testing (eg, saline infusion, fludrocortisone suppression, or captopril challenge test) should be performed to definitively confirm the diagnosis. Once PA is confirmed, adrenal CT scan should be performed to differentiate between an adrenal adenoma and bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. 

Option A (Perform adrenalectomy) is incorrect because an adrenal CT scan should be performed first to localize the source of excess aldosterone. Adrenalectomy may be considered after confirming an adrenal adenoma.

8744,"The correct answer is 'E: Adverse effect of medication.'

The patient's history of schizophrenia and recent start of clozapine therapy, along with the finding of elevated serum prolactin levels, suggests that her nipple discharge is likely due to the adverse effects of her medication. Antipsychotic medications, such as clozapine, can cause hyperprolactinemia (high prolactin levels) which can lead to galactorrhea (nipple discharge), irregular menses, and other symptoms such as this patient is experiencing.

Option A: Hypothyroidism can indeed lead to elevated prolactin levels, but it typically does not result in galactorrhea. The patient's untreated hypothyroidism is likely contributing to her fatigue and weight gain, but it's less likely to be the cause of her nipple discharge.

Option B: Prolactinoma is a benign tumor of the pituitary gland that produces high levels of prolactin.

The condition is typically caused by a defect in cystathionine Î²-synthase (CBS), which normally catalyzes the conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine.

This patient's symptoms, physical examination, and imaging findings are consistent with pneumonia.

When the patient is asked to lie down on his left side (left lateral decubitus position), gravity will increase the blood flow (perfusion) to the right lung that is now dependent, and decrease it to the left lung. This will improve the overall V/Q mismatch, because the blood will be diverted away from the poorly ventilated, affected lung to the healthy, well-ventilated lung.

Option B is incorrect. While perfusion may be improved to the right lung, it won't directly improve the hypoxemia (low blood oxygen). The patient's hypoxemia is due to the infection and inflammation in the left lung, and positioning alone will not resolve this.

Option: {'A': 'Increased perfusion of right lung', 'B': 'Improve the hypoxemia', 'C': 'Worsen the hypocapnia', 'D': 'Decreased ventilation of the left lung', 'E': 'Increase in A-a gradient'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is B, ""Improve the hypoxemia"". 

This patient with fever, productive cough, and localized crackles/consolidation on chest x-ray most likely has lobar pneumonia. In pneumonia, the inflammatory response leads to consolidation, which impairs ventilation of the affected area. However, perfusion may continue unabated. This results in areas of low ventilation-to-perfusion (V/Q) ratio, causing hypoxemia. The body compensates by vasoconstricting the pulmonary vasculature in poorly ventilated areas (hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction) to divert blood flow to well-ventilated regions of the lung to maintain proper oxygenation.

Having the patient lie in the left lateral decubitus position (ie, on the left side) would allow the consolidated lobe to become gravity-dependent and move toward the posterior chest. Because the poorly ventilated, consolidated lung is now gravity-dependent, there will be decreased blood flow to this area due to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. This decreases any shunting of deoxygenated blood, thereby improving oxygenation.

As for the other options, lying in the left lateral decubitus position would not increase perfusion of the right lung (option A) because blood flow is largely determined by systemic factors and the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction response. Similarly, it would not worsen hypocapnia (option C), as hypocapnia in this case is due to hyperventilation from respiratory distress, not body position. It would also not decrease ventilation of the left lung (option D), as the ventilation is already impaired due to pneumonia. Lastly, it would not increase the A-a gradient (option E), as the lateral position would aim to decrease the shunting of deoxygenated blood, which should actually improve the A-a gradient."

The period of symptomatic primary HIV infection, typically occurring 2â??4 weeks after infection, corresponds to the peak of viremia (high-level HIV replication). The HIV test of choice during this period is the HIV RNA viral load, but a rapid HIV diagnostic test can also be used due to its availability and ease of use. A negative test does not rule out infection, as there is a â??window periodâ? in which antibodies to HIV have not yet been produced in detectable amounts.

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a common inherited bleeding disorder that often presents with mucocutaneous bleeding (eg, epistaxis, easy bruising, menorrhagia) and excessive bleeding after trauma or surgery.

It is the most common severe bleeding disorder and is often diagnosed in young men who present with a history of bleeding episodes including excessive hemorrhage after trauma or surgery. Hemarthroses, or bleeding into joint spaces, is also common. Bleeding can range from mild to severe, but the platelet count, bleeding time, and prothrombin time are generally normal.

8780,"The correct answer is A. Carbon monoxide.

The clinical scenario is consistent with methemoglobinemia, a condition characterized by the oxidation of iron in hemoglobin from the ferrous (Fe2+) to the ferric (Fe3+) state, which renders hemoglobin incapable of binding oxygen. This leads to a left-shift in the oxygen dissociation curve and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, resulting in symptoms of hypoxia. In this case, locally prepared baby food may have been contaminated with nitrates, a known cause of acquired methemoglobinemia, especially in infants. Other causes include certain medications (e.g., dapsone, benzocaine) and exposure to aniline dyes. The condition is characterized by cyanosis and chocolate-colored blood, both of which are apparent in this infant.

Treatment of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning can cause a similar presentation because the antidote for CO poisoning is 100% oxygen or hyperbaric oxygen, both of which can induce methemoglobinemia in high concentrations. 

Option B, Cyanide intoxication, causes a similar clinical presentation as CO poisoning, including altered mental status and cardiovascular collapse. However, cyanide poisoning does not cause the skin and blood discoloration seen in methemoglobinemia.

Methemoglobinemia is characterized by cyanosis (blue tinge to the skin) and chocolate-colored blood (darker than normal). This is due to the presence of methemoglobin, an oxidized form of hemoglobin that is unable to bind and transport oxygen efficiently, leading to tissue hypoxia. Methemoglobinemia can also lead to lethargy and rapid, labored breathing due to hypoxia. The baby may have been exposed to oxidizing agents in the locally prepared baby food or from lead in paint or dust in the old house. Treatment of methemoglobinemia involves the use of methylene blue, which reduces methemoglobin back to hemoglobin.

A - Carbon monoxide poisoning results in cherry red skin color and normal-colored blood, not cyanosis and dark blood. Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin with high affinity, impairing oxygen transport.

B - Cyanide poisoning leads to a similar clinical picture but without the dark blood. Cyanide inhibits cytochrome c oxidase, disrupting cellular respiration and leading to lactic acidosis.

C - Lead poisoning in children typically presents with intellectual disability, abdominal pain, and anemia. It wouldn't cause cyanosis or dark-colored blood.

D - Methanol poisoning can lead to metabolic acidosis and visual disturbances due to its metabolites, but not cyanosis or dark-colored blood.

8783,"The most likely drug prescribed in this case is 'C': Unfractionated heparin. 

The patient's presentation is suggestive of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), for which anticoagulation is indicated. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is often used as initial therapy due to its rapid onset of action. The coagulation studies show a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT), which is consistent with the use of UFH. UFH activates antithrombin III, which in turn inhibits clotting factors IIa (thrombin) and Xa. The effectiveness of UFH is monitored by aPTT.

'D': Apixaban is a factor Xa inhibitor and would not typically cause an isolated elevation in PTT. Its effect is more typically monitored with Prothrombin time (PT) and INR.

'E': Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) like enoxaparin also works through antithrombin III but primarily inhibits factor Xa. Unlike UFH, LMWH has a predictable anticoagulant response and does not require monitoring with aPTT. Therefore, its use would not be expected to increase the PTT.

8815,"The correct answer is A: Serum antibodies against Class I HLA antigens.

This patient's postoperative hypotension, flank pain, and dark urine (suggestive of hemoglobinuria) are consistent with acute transfusion reaction due to intravascular hemolysis. The most common cause of this is ABO incompatibility, which typically occurs when the patient is mistakenly given the wrong blood type. However, in this case, the patient has had multiple transfusions in the past, making it more likely she has developed an antibody to an antigen on the donor red blood cells (RBCs), resulting in a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR). 

DHTR is a common complication in patients with sickle cell disease, occurring in up to 11% of those who receive transfusions. The antigen most frequently involved is a Class I HLA antigen, but any antigen not found on the recipient's RBCs can potentially cause DHTR. The reaction typically occurs within 1 week of transfusion (but can occur as early as 1 hour, as in this case), and clinical manifestations can include fever, pain (eg, back, chest, flank), and hemoglobinuria.

Option B: Low levels of serum IgA immunoglobulins - This can cause anaphylactic transfusion reactions, not hemolytic reactions. Symptoms would include hypotension, respiratory distress, and potential cardiac arrest immediately after transfusion.

Option C: Positive blood cultures - This would suggest a septic transfusion reaction, which is extremely rare and generally associated with transfusion of contaminated blood products.

Option D: Positive direct Coombs test - This suggests autoimmunity or alloimmunity as a cause of hemolysis. Although this patient has a transfusion reaction, her symptoms began before the transfused cells would have had time to sensitize her immune system and therefore a Coombs test would likely be negative.

Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions, as in this patient, typically occur days to weeks after a transfusion. Symptoms are usually less severe and include fever and anemia. In patients with sickle cell disease, who are frequently transfused, alloimmunization (ie, development of antibodies against antigens on transfused cells) can occur.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is D. ""Proofreading for mismatched nucleotides.""

The enzyme that can both elongate the DNA of the lagging strand and proofread for mismatched nucleotides is DNA polymerase III. This enzyme has 3'?5' exonuclease activity, which allows it to remove incorrectly paired nucleotides and replace them with the correct ones, a process known as proofreading.

Option A is incorrect because all DNA polymerases, not just this specific enzyme, synthesize DNA in the 5' ? 3' direction.

Option B is incorrect because the 5'?3' exonuclease activity is not held by DNA polymerase III but is a feature of DNA polymerase I in prokaryotes. This activity is used during the process of replacing RNA primers with DNA.

Option C is incorrect because the creation of ribonucleotide primers is not a function of DNA polymerase III but of RNA primase.

Option E is incorrect because the prevention of reannealing of the leading and lagging strands is a function of single-strand DNA-binding proteins, not DNA polymerase III. These proteins stabilize the separated DNA strands, allowing the replication machinery to synthesize the new DNA strands."
8841,"The patient in the vignette has a clinical presentation consistent with Pena-Shokeir syndrome type I (also known as fetal akinesia deformation sequence). This rare autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by decreased fetal movement (fetal akinesia) leading to joint contractures, pulmonary hypoplasia, and characteristic facial features (eg, widely separated eyes with epicanthal folds, a broad nasal bridge, low set ears, and a receding chin). The decreased fetal movement is believed to be secondary to a neuromuscular disease, such as anterior horn cell degeneration or muscular disease; however, the exact etiology is unknown. In addition to joint contractures and pulmonary hypoplasia, other findings can include polyhydramnios, short umbilical cord, and intrauterine growth restriction. 

Regarding the other options, anencephaly and spina bifida (options A and E) are both neural tube defects that would not be expected to cause joint contractures or the characteristic facial features seen in this patient. Duodenal atresia (option B) is associated with Down syndrome and would not explain the patient's presentation. Juvenile polycystic kidney disease (option C) can cause severe renal disease but would not cause joint contractures or the characteristic facial features seen in this patient.

Neural tube defects result from failed closure of the embryonic neural tube, and include anencephaly and spina bifida (myelomeningocele and spina bifida occulta). 

Myelomeningocele is characterized by a fluid-filled sac containing meninges, cerebrospinal fluid, and a portion of the spinal cord or nerve roots. This defect is usually located along the lumbar region of the spine, but can occur anywhere along the spinal axis. Polyhydramnios, as seen in this patient, is common due to impaired swallowing by the fetus secondary to a Chiari II malformation (eg, dysphagia, aspiration).

Holoprosencephaly (Option A) is a forebrain defect that would not result in elevated AFP. Lissencephaly (Option B) is a neuronal migration disorder that would not be associated with elevated AFP or acetylcholinesterase. Spina bifida occulta (Option C) is a mild form of spina bifida that is often asymptomatic and would not be associated with elevated AFP or acetylcholinesterase. Anencephaly (Option E) is a severe neural tube defect that could result in elevated AFP; however, the presence of polyhydramnios is more suggestive of a spinal defect.","stop","the correct answer is 'd: myelomeningocele'.","D","E","USMLE question: A 29-year-old primigravid woman at 18 weeksÃ¢â?¬â?¢ gestation comes to the physician for her first prenatal visit.

The presence of both increased a-fetoprotein in maternal serum and the elevation of a-fetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase in amniotic fluid are suggestive of an open neural tube defect such as anencephaly or myelomeningocele. Anencephaly would typically be observed on ultrasonography as an absence of the cranial vault. The presence of an enlarged amniotic fluid volume (polyhydramnios) is due to the inability of the fetus to swallow and absorb amniotic fluid as a result of lower cranial nerve dysfunction that is associated with myelomeningocele, making option 'D' the correct answer.

Anencephaly (Option 'E') is incorrect as it usually presents with decreased or absent cranial vault on ultrasound, which is not the case here. 

Holoprosencephaly (Option 'A') and lissencephaly (Option 'B') are severe brain malformations that usually do not cause an increase in a-fetoprotein levels. 

Spina bifida occulta (Option 'C') is a closed neural tube defect that does not cause an elevation in amniotic fluid a-fetoprotein levels because the defect is covered by skin, thus a-fetoprotein does not leak into the amniotic fluid."

8976,"The best answer is 'B': Serum creatinine (SCr).

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with acute urinary retention secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). His long-standing suprapubic pain and inability to urinate are likely due to bladder overdistension. A bladder scan showing 700 ml of urine confirms the diagnosis. The patient's elevated blood pressure could be a result of the pain and distress from his condition.

Upon catheterization and relief of the urinary obstruction, his kidneys should have been able to excrete the retained solutes and water. However, his serum creatinine level increased from 1.4 to 1.6 mg/dL 8 hours after admission, suggesting an impairment of renal function - possibly acute kidney injury (AKI). This is a serious condition that can lead to permanent kidney damage or kidney failure if not promptly treated. Hence, the senior attending's suggestion for a Nephrology consult is appropriate.

Option 'A': Serum potassium levels have slightly decreased from admission, which is expected after resolution of urinary retention and is not a cause for concern.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is B. 'Serum creatinine (SCr)'. 

The patient's presentation is consistent with acute kidney injury (AKI) due to obstructive uropathy from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The hallmark of obstructive uropathy is a progressive rise in serum creatinine (SCr), which indicates worsening renal function. 

In this case, the patient's SCr increased from 1.4 mg/dL upon admission to 1.6 mg/dL 8 hours later. This rise in SCr likely represents a decrease in glomerular filtration rate due to the urinary obstruction. The obstructive uropathy would have caused a decrease in renal perfusion and a subsequent increase in serum creatinine. This is why a consultation with Nephrology is suggested, to manage the AKI and prevent further renal damage. 

Option A. 'Serum potassium' is incorrect because the patient's serum potassium levels are within normal range and do not show a significant change.

Option C. 'Serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN)' is incorrect because although the BUN levels are high, they do not show a significant change. BUN can be elevated in dehydration, which could be secondary to decreased fluid intake due to his urinary symptoms, but this alone does not justify a nephrology consult.

Option D. 'Urine output' is incorrect because while the patient's urine output is low, this is expected due to the urinary obstruction and does not by itself justify a nephrology consult.

Option E. 'Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)' is incorrect because eGFR is not provided in the lab results. However, a decrease in eGFR would be expected given the rise in serum creatinine."
8988,"The correct answer is 'B: Prominent V wave'.

The patient's symptoms of exertional dyspnea, orthopnea (waking up coughing and gasping for air), and a holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex are suggestive of mitral regurgitation. This condition often develops gradually, allowing for left atrial and left ventricular compensatory dilatation. Symptoms occur when these compensatory mechanisms are overwhelmed or when acute worsening of regurgitation occurs.

Physical examination may show a prominent V wave in the jugular venous pulse. The V wave corresponds to venous return during ventricular systole when the tricuspid valve is closed. In mitral regurgitation, the regurgitant volume builds up in the left atrium during systole and empties into the left ventricle during diastole, thus leading to a prominent V wave. 

As for the other options: 

- 'A: Early diastolic extra heart sound' is associated with conditions such as aortic regurgitation, not mitral regurgitation.
- 'C: Head bobbing' is a sign of aortic insufficiency (De Musset's sign), not mitral regurgitation.
- 'D: Absence of A2 heart sound' is associated with conditions such as aortic stenosis or aortic valve replacement.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's symptoms of exertional dyspnea, nocturnal cough, and an apex holosystolic murmur suggest mitral regurgitation (MR). MR can result from conditions that cause dilation of the left ventricle and mitral annulus (eg, ischemic heart disease, dilated cardiomyopathy), or from primary abnormalities of the mitral valve leaflets or chordae tendineae (eg, mitral valve prolapse, rheumatic heart disease).

During left ventricular systole, the mitral valve normally prevents the backflow of blood into the left atrium. When the mitral valve is regurgitant, the high-pressure gradient between the left ventricle and left atrium during systole forces blood back into the left atrium, causing it to dilate and hypertrophy. Over time, chronic volume overload leads to pulmonary venous hypertension, which can manifest as exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.

The murmur of chronic MR is holosystolic and is best heard at the apex with radiation to the axilla (Option E). Acute exacerbation of MR due to chordae tendineae rupture is characterized by a new holosystolic murmur and signs of acute left heart failure (eg, pulmonary edema, hypoxia).

Option A (Early diastolic extra heart sound) - This refers to an S3, or ventricular gallop, which signifies rapid ventricular filling as seen in states of volume overload such as heart failure or mitral regurgitation. However, it appears during diastole, not systole, and therefore would not coincide with the holosystolic murmur of MR.

Option B (Prominent V wave) - This is seen in tricuspid regurgitation or severe MR, but would be found on jugular venous pressure examination, not cardiac auscultation.

Option C (Head bobbing) - This is known as de Musset's sign and is found in aortic regurgitation, not MR.

Option D (Absence of A2 heart sound) - This could suggest aortic valve disease or a bundle branch block, but is not a feature of MR."
8991,"The correct answer is A. Colposcopy with endocervical sampling.

The patient's Pap smear reveals a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), indicative of HPV infection. The presence of LSIL is an indication for colposcopy for further examination of the cervix and to take biopsy samples for histological diagnosis. The purpose of the colposcopy is to detect high-grade lesions that could progress to cervical cancer if left untreated. The colposcopy procedure includes a visual inspection of the cervix, and directed biopsies of any suspicious areas. Endocervical sampling is also performed to check for lesions that might be located within the cervical canal, not visible during the colposcopy.

9003,"The correct answer is 'A': Drop of systolic blood pressure by 20 mmHg during inspiration.

This patient's dizziness, palpitations, and low blood pressure suggest that he has developed cardiogenic shock following his recent myocardial infarction and percutaneous coronary intervention. The elevated oxygen concentration at the pulmonary artery also supports this diagnosis. This is because, in cardiogenic shock, the cardiac output is insufficient to meet the body's demands, leading to reduced perfusion and increased oxygen extraction at the tissues. This results in a higher than normal oxygen concentration in the pulmonary artery, because less oxygen is being taken up and used by the tissues.

The drop in systolic blood pressure by more than 10 mmHg during inspiration (also known as pulsus paradoxus) is a characteristic finding in cardiogenic shock. This is due to the increase in intrathoracic pressure during inspiration, which further reduces the already compromised ventricular filling and stroke volume, leading to a significant drop in systolic blood pressure.

Option 'B': A harsh, loud, holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border is suggestive of ventricular septal defect (VSD), which is a possible complication of myocardial infarction. However, this is less likely given the absence of signs such as a new murmur or heart failure.

It can be caused by any condition that results in decreased circulating blood volume (eg, dehydration, blood loss), impaired autonomic reflexes (eg, diabetic neuropathy), or medications (eg, antihypertensives, tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines). In this patient with recent MI, initial management should include review of the medication list and consideration of decreasing antihypertensive therapy if blood pressure is consistently low.

Option B (Harsh, loud, holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border) suggests ventricular septal rupture, a mechanical complication of MI that would instead cause signs of heart failure and/or cardiogenic shock.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is E. 'The urea value is within normal limits'.

Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) is a measure of renal function and reflects the balance between urea production (in the liver), urea breakdown, and urea excretion (in the kidneys). The normal BUN range is approximately 7 to 20 mg/dL, therefore the patient's BUN of 4 mg/dL is indeed lower than normal. However, this is not necessarily indicative of a problem.

Liver disease - like cirrhosis, indeed, can decrease blood urea nitrogen levels. This happens because the liver is not able to produce urea because of a decrease in functional hepatic mass. Although this patient does have liver disease, her BUN is not lower than normal.

Use of probenecid - Probenecid is a uricosuric drug, meaning it increases the excretion of uric acid in the urine. It does not have any direct impact on BUN levels and hence this option is incorrect.

Spironolactone - This is a potassium-sparing diuretic. It can potentially raise BUN levels by reducing renal perfusion. But in this case, the BUN level is not elevated.

Increase in dietary protein - High protein intake can increase BUN levels as the body metabolizes more nitrogen-containing amino acids. Again, this is not the situation in this case as the BUN level is not elevated. 

Therefore, none of the other options are valid explanations for the patient's BUN result."

9024,"This patient's presentation of ataxia, somnolence, and slurred speech are suggestive of alcohol intoxication, which is common among homeless individuals. Chronic alcohol use up-regulates the GABA receptor, a chloride channel. When activated by GABA, the channel opens to allow chloride ions to enter the neuron, thereby hyperpolarizing it and decreasing its likelihood of firing an action potential. This leads to the CNS depression seen in acute alcohol intoxication. Chronic alcohol use can lead to physical dependence and an abstinence syndrome upon cessation. Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal can begin as early as 6 hours from last drink and include autonomic hyperactivity (eg, tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia), hand tremor, insomnia, nausea or vomiting, transient hallucinations or illusions, psychomotor agitation, anxiety, and seizures. Alcohol withdrawal delirium (delirium tremens), the most severe form of alcohol withdrawal, can occur 48-96 hours after the last drink and is characterized by severe confusion, hallucinations, fever, and autonomic instability. If left untreated, it can cause death.

Therefore, the correct answer is 'B': Delayed delirium. 

Option 'A': Cardiovascular collapse is not typically associated with alcohol withdrawal, but could be seen in severe cases of opioid or benzodiazepine withdrawal.

On arrival, he is found to be sluggish and has slow and sometimes incoherent speech. He is also drowsy and falls asleep several times during questioning. Chart review shows that he has previously been admitted after getting a severe cut during a bar fight. Otherwise, he is known to be intermittently homeless and has poorly managed diabetes. Serum testing reveals the presence of a substance that increases the duration of opening for an important channel. Which of the following symptoms may be seen if the most likely substance in this patient is abruptly discontinued?
Option: {'A': 'Cardiovascular collapse', 'B': 'Delayed delirium', 'C': 'Flashbacks', 'D': 'Insomnia', 'E': 'Piloerection'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's history of intermittent homelessness and a prior admission after a bar fight, combined with his current sluggishness, drowsiness, and slow and incoherent speech suggest alcohol use disorder. Chronic alcohol use enhances the function of the GABA-A receptor, an inhibitory chloride channel, leading to CNS depression. Acute discontinuation can lead to withdrawal symptoms, including delirium tremens (DTs). DTs is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that presents with altered mental status and sympathetic overdrive (eg, tachycardia, hypertension, fever, diaphoresis). This typically occurs 48-96 hours after the last drink and can last for up to 5-7 days. Thus, this patient is at risk for delayed delirium if his alcohol use is abruptly discontinued, making answer B the correct choice. 

Options A (Cardiovascular collapse) and C (Flashbacks) are associated with opioid and hallucinogen use disorder, respectively. Option D (Insomnia) can be a symptom of many substance withdrawal syndromes, but it is not the most specific or severe consequence of suddenly stopping alcohol use. Option E (Piloerection) is a symptom of opioid withdrawal, also known as ""goosebumps,"" and is not related to alcohol withdrawal."
9040,"The correct answer is A. Dysfunction of Na+ channels. 

This patient's symptoms of weakness, fatigue, depressed deep tendon reflexes, and significantly peaked T-waves on ECG are suggestive of hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia can result from excessive dietary intake, as in this patient who is following a juice-only diet. Many types of fruit juices (like orange and tomato) are high in potassium. The clinical manifestations of hyperkalemia are primarily neuromuscular and cardiovascular.

Hyperkalemia causes resting membrane depolarization due to a decrease in the potassium concentration gradient across the cell membrane. This depolarization inactivates voltage-gated sodium channels, thus, reducing the number of channels available for the generation of action potentials. This results in decreased neuromuscular excitability, which manifests as muscle weakness, fatigue, and depressed deep tendon reflexes.

Option B: The resting membrane potential of skeletal muscle cells decreases in hyperkalemia, not increases. The increase in extracellular potassium causes a smaller concentration gradient between the inside and outside of the cell, which decreases the resting membrane potential and makes the cell more likely to depolarize.

Option C: The dysfunction of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex is seen in diseases like Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy, not hyperkalemia.

Option D: Hyperpolarization of skeletal muscle cells is unlikely in hyperkalemia. In fact, the cells are more likely to be depolarized because of the high extracellular potassium levels.

Option E: Prolonged release of Ca2+ ions after stimulation of ryanodine receptors is a mechanism involved in malignant hyperthermia and not related to hyperkalemia.","stop","the correct answer is a. dysfunction of na+ channels.","A","B","USMLE question: A 55-year-old man presents to his physician with weakness and fatigue for 1 week.

His physical examination is completely normal, except for depressed deep tendon reflexes. The only abnormality in a complete laboratory evaluation is a serum potassium level of 6.0 mEq/L (6.0 mmol/L). There are significantly peaked T-waves on ECG.

Option: {'A': 'Dysfunction of Na+ channels', 'B': 'Decreased resting membrane potential of skeletal muscle cells', 'C': 'Dysfunction of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex', 'D': 'Hyperpolarization of skeletal muscle cells', 'E': 'Prolonged release of Ca2+ ions after stimulation of Ryanodine receptors'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is A: Dysfunction of Na+ channels. 

The patient's symptoms, along with the laboratory findings and ECG changes, suggest the diagnosis of hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia, or high potassium levels in the blood, can cause symptoms such as weakness and fatigue, as well as ECG changes like peaked T-waves. Sodium channels play a key role in maintaining normal electrical activity in muscle cells, including the heart. High levels of potassium can affect the function of these sodium channels, leading to abnormalities in cell excitability and conduction.

Option B: Decreased resting membrane potential of skeletal muscle cells is incorrect because hyperkalemia actually leads to depolarization (not hyperpolarization) of the cell membrane, which would increase (not decrease) the resting membrane potential.

Option C: Dysfunction of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex is incorrect. This mechanism is involved in muscular dystrophy, not hyperkalemia.

Option D: Hyperpolarization of skeletal muscle cells is incorrect. Hyperkalemia leads to depolarization, not hyperpolarization.

Option E: Prolonged release of Ca2+ ions after stimulation of Ryanodine receptors is incorrect. This would be more consistent with a condition affecting the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle cells, such as malignant hyperthermia. It is not a mechanism of hyperkalemia."

This patientâ??s urinary retention is likely due to postoperative bladder atony, a common complication of anesthesia and surgery, especially in elderly patients. The mechanism of action of alpha-blockers, such as tamsulosin and doxazosin, includes relaxing the smooth muscle in the bladder neck and prostate, which can facilitate urine flow. 

Option A: Parasympathetic agonists would likely worsen the patient's condition, as they would increase the contractile tone of the bladder, potentially exacerbating urinary retention.

Option B: Sympathetic agonists would also worsen the condition, as they would cause contraction of the bladder neck and prostate, making it more difficult for urine to flow.

Option C: Parasympathetic antagonists would have the opposite effect of parasympathetic agonists and could potentially help to relieve urinary retention. However, they are not the first-line treatment for this condition.

Option A: Parasympathetic agonists, such as bethanechol, would increase the contractions of the bladder to promote urination. However, these are not used as a first-line treatment because they can have systemic effects and are not as effective as alpha-blockers.

Option B: Sympathetic agonists would not be beneficial in this situation. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to relaxation of the bladder detrusor muscle and contraction of the internal urethral sphincter, which would worsen urinary retention.

Option C: Parasympathetic antagonists would also worsen urinary retention. Blocking the parasympathetic nervous system would decrease detrusor muscle contractions and inhibit urination.

Option E: Beta-blockers are used primarily for cardiovascular conditions like hypertension and arrhythmias, and do not play a role in the treatment of urinary retention.

Therefore, the most likely explanation for this patient's bleeding is decreased hepatic synthesis of coagulation factors and thrombocytopenia (Option B).

Option A is incorrect because bacterial destruction would not result in bleeding from IV sites or new bruises, especially given the fact that the patient is afebrile and has been receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy.
Option C is incorrect because renal excretion does not play a significant role in the metabolism of anticoagulants and the patient's history and presentation do not suggest renal disease.
Option D is incorrect because diffuse activation of the coagulation cascade would lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation, a condition characterized by both bleeding and thrombosis. This patient has only evidence of bleeding.

9065,"The answer is 'C': Obstructive sleep apnea. 

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder, particularly in obese or elderly patients, characterized by repeated episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep, causing hypopnea (decreased respiratory effort) or apnea (cessation of respiratory effort). These episodes are caused by relaxation of the pharyngeal muscles, which leads to a blockage of the airway. Symptoms include snoring, repeated awakenings, and daytime sleepiness. The condition may be severe enough to cause hypoxia, which is consistent with the patient's low SpO2.

Option 'A': Incorrect ventilator settings may cause respiratory problems, but this does not explain the patient's symptoms of apnea while sleeping before being admitted to the ICU. 

Option 'B': Central sleep apnea is a neurological condition in which the brain fails to properly control breathing during sleep. However, this condition typically does not lead to severe hypoxia or respiratory distress, making it less likely than obstructive sleep apnea.

Option 'D': Angioedema would cause sudden and dramatic symptoms, typically involving the face or throat. It does not explain the patient's symptoms of sleep apnea.

Option 'E': Heart failure can cause sleep apnea, but this is typically a central sleep apnea, not an obstructive one. The patient's presentation and the lack of other heart failure symptoms make this option less likely.","stop","the answer is 'c': obstructive sleep apnea.","C","B","USMLE question: A 67-year-old man with a past medical history of sleep apnea presents to the emergency room in severe respiratory distress.

He is intubated, admitted to the intensive care unit, and eventually requires a tracheostomy tube. After surgery, he continues to have episodes of apnea while sleeping. What is the most likely underlying cause of his apnea?
Option: {'A': 'Incorrect ventilator settings', 'B': 'Central sleep apnea', 'C': 'Obstructive sleep apnea', 'D': 'Angioedema', 'E': 'Heart failure'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The most likely cause of this patient's apnea is Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) (Option C). OSA occurs when the muscles in the back of the throat fail to keep the airway open. This results in repeated episodes of partial or complete blockage of the upper airway during sleep, causing drops in blood oxygen saturation that can result in awakenings from sleep. Risk factors for OSA include obesity, male gender, age (50-70 years), and smoking. Even after tracheostomy, which bypasses the site of obstruction, patients with OSA may continue to have apneic episodes due to closure of the tracheostomy tube during sleep, as a result of negative pressure generated by inspiratory effort.

Option A, Incorrect ventilator settings, could cause apnea, but ventilator settings would have been checked and adjusted as needed after intubation, and especially after the patient continued to have apnea episodes.

Option B, Central sleep apnea, is less likely since this patient's history is more consistent with OSA. Central sleep apnea is characterized by cessation of respiratory effort during sleep due to a lack of respiratory rhythm generation by the central nervous system. It's more commonly associated with conditions such as heart failure, stroke, and usage of certain medications.

Option D, Angioedema, is a swelling of the lower layer of skin and tissue just below the skin or mucous membranes. It can cause difficulty breathing if it happens in the throat or tongue, but this condition usually develops quickly and resolves with appropriate treatment.

Option E, Heart failure, can cause Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern with alternating periods of rapid breathing and apnea, but it does not typically present with apnea alone, as seen in this patient. Furthermore, there is no other indication of heart failure in the history given. 

Thus, the most likely underlying cause of his apnea is OSA (Option C)."
9072,"The most likely diagnosis is B: Duodenal atresia.

Duodenal atresia results in obstruction of the distal stomach and proximal duodenum causing bilious vomiting (since the obstruction is distal to the entry of the bile duct), a distended stomach and proximal duodenum (""double bubble"" sign on x-ray), and a gasless distal intestine. Polyhydramnios often occurs during pregnancy due to the inability of the fetus to swallow and absorb amniotic fluid.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) from rhabdomyolysis occurs due to a combination of mechanisms that include renal vasoconstriction, direct myoglobin toxicity, and intratubular cast formation. The urinalysis typically shows a large blood reaction but few or no red blood cells on microscopy. The most serious electrolyte disorder in rhabdomyolysis is hyperkalemia due to massive potassium release from injured muscle cells and decreased renal potassium excretion from AKI. Hyperkalemia can cause life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and is therefore a medical emergency. The initial management of hyperkalemia includes stabilization of cardiac myocytes with calcium gluconate or calcium chloride (choice D), followed by temporizing measures to shift potassium intracellularly (eg, sodium bicarbonate, insulin/glucose, albuterol), and definitive treatment to remove potassium from the body (eg, hemodialysis, sodium polystyrene sulfonate).

Option D is incorrect. There is no clear link between dissociative amnesia and bipolar disorder. While both can co-exist, having one does not necessarily mean the patient is more likely to have the other.

Option E is incorrect. While the memory loss in dissociative amnesia can be temporary (self-limiting), it can also persist and significantly affect the patient's life. This is why it is important to seek treatment."
9088,"The patient's presentation is consistent with cyanide toxicity, a well-known complication of sodium nitroprusside therapy, especially at high doses and in patients with renal insufficiency. Sodium nitroprusside contains five cyanide groups that are released upon administration. Usually, these are converted in the liver to thiocyanate, which is then renally excreted. However, in the setting of high-dose therapy or renal insufficiency, cyanide can accumulate. Clinical manifestations include altered mental status, lactic acidosis (due to inhibition of aerobic metabolism), abdominal pain, and flushing. Treatment is with sodium thiosulfate (Choice E), which serves as a sulfur donor to hepatic rhodanese, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of cyanide to thiocyanate.

Penicillamine (Choice A) is used for treatment of Wilson disease and cystinuria. Dimercaprol (Choice B) is used for arsenic, gold, and acute mercury poisoning but not for cyanide toxicity. Amyl nitrite (Choice C) is used as an antidote for cyanide poisoning in conjunction with sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate; however, it's not as commonly used due to side effects.

9116,"The correct answer is C. Intrapulmonary shunting.

The clinical findings of fatigue, cyanosis, digital clubbing, and elevated right atrial pressure in a patient with Down syndrome suggest Eisenmenger syndrome, a condition that occurs when a congenital heart disease with a left-to-right shunt (eg, ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, or patent ductus arteriosus) causes chronic pulmonary hypertension. The chronic exposure to increased blood flow and pressure leads to vascular remodeling in the lungs, resulting in pulmonary arterial hypertension. As the pulmonary resistance increases, it can surpass systemic resistance, reversing the shunt to right-to-left. This right-to-left shunt (intrapulmonary shunting) causes deoxygenated blood to bypass the lungs and enter the systemic circulation, leading to hypoxemia and cyanosis.

By inhibiting this enzyme, metyrapone reduces the synthesis of cortisol. Reduced cortisol levels stimulate the hypothalamus and pituitary gland to increase production and release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and ACTH through negative feedback mechanisms. However, in the short term, with an acute dose of metyrapone, the feedback inhibition of ACTH by cortisol might not have had the time to kick in, hence ACTH levels could initially decrease.

Option 'B': Normetanephrine is a metabolite of norepinephrine and would not be directly affected by metyrapone.

Option 'C': Epinephrine (adrenaline) is a hormone produced by the adrenal medulla, not the adrenal cortex. Its synthesis is not directly affected by metyrapone.

Option 'D': Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is not directly affected by metyrapone.

Option 'E': Dihydroxyphenylalanine or DOPA is a precursor to dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Its synthesis is not directly affected by metyrapone."
9208,"The correct answer is D. 'Such anatomy is formed before the 12th week of intrauterine development'

Hypospadias, a condition where the urethral meatus is located on the ventral surface of the penis, forms within the first 12 weeks of intrauterine development. Normally, the urethral folds fuse in the midline to form the penile urethra, with the urethral meatus at the tip of the glans. However, in hypospadias, this process is disrupted, and the urethral meatus is located proximally on the ventral surface of the penis.

Option A is incorrect because maternal age is not a major risk factor for hypospadias.

Option B is incorrect because hypospadias results from a failure of the urethral folds to fuse, not the genital swellings. Genital swellings give rise to the scrotum and labia majora.

Option C is incorrect because hypospadias repair is usually performed before the age of 3 years and is not associated with an increased incidence of urethrocutaneous fistula.

Hypospadias, a condition where the urethral meatus opens ventrally instead of at the tip of the glans penis, is one of the most common congenital malformations of the genitourinary tract in males. It forms before the 12th week of intrauterine development.

Now, let's see why the other options are incorrect:

A: 'Younger age of the mother is a major risk factor for this condition' - This is incorrect. Hypospadias is not associated with the mother's age. Instead, it is associated with increased maternal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, advanced maternal age, and in vitro fertilization.

B: 'It results from the failure of the genital swellings to fuse' - This is not correct. The fusion of the genital swellings or labioscrotal swellings form the scrotum and labia majora, not the urethra.

C: 'Hypospadias repair before the age of 3 years is associated with increased incidence of urethrocutaneous fistula' - This is not correct. Hypospadias repair is typically performed between 6 to 18 months of age. The timing of the repair does not increase the risk of fistula development.

E: 'It results from failure of the genital folds to fuse' - This is incorrect. Hypospadias results from the incomplete closure of the urethral folds, not the genital folds. The genital folds develop into the labia minora in females and the ventral shaft of the penis in males."
9229,"This patient's history of attempted suicide by wrist laceration, rapid transfusion, subsequent mental status changes, and fever suggest a transfusion reaction. Although the most common complication of transfusion is fever (due to recipient antibodies against donor leukocytes), this patient's confusion and flank pain (suggesting renal injury) indicate a more severe reaction. The decreased haptoglobin, increased bilirubin, and hemoglobinemia (Hemoglobin 9 g/dL after transfusion) point toward intravascular hemolysis, which occurs in ABO incompatible transfusions (Option C). In an ABO incompatible transfusion, preformed recipient IgM antibodies bind the incompatible donor red blood cells, activating the complement cascade, leading to intravascular hemolysis. The released free hemoglobin is nephrotoxic and can lead to acute kidney injury. Other findings may include hypotension, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and shock. This is a medical emergency and requires immediate cessation of the transfusion.

Option A (Non-cardiogenic acute lung injury) would not present with hemolysis or kidney injury. Option B (Decreased IgA levels) could lead to an anaphylactic transfusion reaction in IgA-deficient patients, but this is rare and typically presents with respiratory distress and hypotension. Option D (Minor blood group incompatibility) can cause a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (eg, due to Rh or Kidd antigen incompatibility) which is less severe and does not present acutely.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The most likely diagnosis in this case is 'E': Recipient antibody reaction against foreign leukocytes. This reaction is commonly known as Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) and is a severe complication of blood transfusion. 

The patient initially presented with hemorrhagic shock due to wrist lacerations and was administered IV fluids and a rapid transfusion sequence. After stabilization, his condition worsens again with fever, tachycardia, hypotension and low oxygen saturation, which are signs of TRALI. This reaction typically occurs within 6 hours following transfusion and is the leading cause of transfusion-related mortality.

Option 'A': Non-cardiogenic acute lung injury, is not likely in the absence of a triggering event such as severe trauma, pneumonia, or aspiration. 

Option 'B': Decreased IgA levels, might result in an anaphylactic reaction following transfusion in patients with IgA deficiency, but this usually includes symptoms such as urticaria, bronchospasm, and angioedema. 

Option 'C': Major blood group incompatibility, would lead to a hemolytic transfusion reaction, but this would likely cause jaundice, back pain, hemoglobinuria, and renal failure, which are not described in the case.

Option 'D': Minor blood group incompatibility, might trigger a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction, however, this typically occurs days or weeks after transfusion and not within hours as described.

In TRALI, it is believed that leukocytes in the transfused blood product trigger an inflammatory response in the recipient's lungs, leading to capillary leakage and subsequent hypoxemia and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The patient's flank pain could also be a sign of acute kidney injury, secondary to hypotension, another possible complication of TRALI.

9235,"The fetus most likely has gastroschisis (Option 'C'). Gastroschisis is a birth defect in which the baby's intestines extend outside of the body through a hole beside the belly button. This condition is associated with elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein, which is typically used as a marker for neural tube defects and abdominal wall defects in the fetus. The specific location of the defect (to the right of the umbilical cord) and the fact that the intestines are freely floating in the amniotic fluid are also characteristic of gastroschisis.

Option 'A', chromosomal trisomy, is unlikely as it often presents with more severe and widespread anomalies than an isolated abdominal wall defect. Option 'B', spina bifida, is a neural tube defect that would typically present with an elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein, but it wouldn't cause a defect in the abdominal wall. Option 'D', bladder exstrophy, is a defect in the bladder wall and would not cause intestinal herniation.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is E: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. 

The ultrasound findings described in the vignette are consistent with omphalocele, in which abdominal contents herniate into the umbilical cord. The herniated bowel is covered by a peritoneal sac. Omphalocele is associated with other congenital abnormalities in approximately 50% of cases and is often a component of genetic syndromes like Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, which is also associated with macrosomia, macroglossia, hemihyperplasia, organomegaly, hypoglycemia, and an increased risk of developing embryonal tumors (eg, Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma).

Option A is incorrect. Chromosomal trisomy is associated with certain congenital malformations. For example, Down syndrome (trisomy 21) is associated with endocardial cushion defects, duodenal atresia, and Hirschsprung disease, but it is not typically associated with omphalocele.

Option B is incorrect. Spina bifida is a defect in the closure of the vertebral column and does not involve the abdominal wall.

Option C is incorrect. Intestinal dysmotility refers to disorders like Hirschsprung disease and is not associated with omphalocele.

Option D is incorrect. Bladder exstrophy is a congenital defect that involves the bladder and possibly other parts of the urinary system, but it does not involve the abdominal wall.

9236,"The correct answer is E. 'Administration of vitamin K to the mother during labor results in a reduction in the incidence of widespread subcutaneous ecchymosis that may be seen immediately after birth in otherwise normal premature infants.' 

Neonates, especially premature ones, are at risk of developing vitamin K deficiency bleeding because of low vitamin K stores at birth and a sterile gut that lacks the bacteria necessary for synthesizing vitamin K. Vitamin K is essential for the gamma-carboxylation and activation of factors II, VII, IX, and X and proteins C and S.

This patient's generalized purpura (a sign of disseminated intravascular coagulation), hemorrhagic gastric aspirate, and coagulation studies suggestive of a consumptive coagulopathy are suggestive of vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB). VKDB of the newborn refers to bleeding caused by inadequate levels of vitamin K, which is required for the synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X in the liver. VKDB can be categorized as early (first 24 hours of life), classic (days 2-7), or late (week 2 to 6 months).

The most effective method of contraception that works without hormones and would allow the patient to become pregnant at a later time is the use of a copper intrauterine device (IUD). The copper IUD works primarily by inducing a local inflammatory reaction within the uterus, which is toxic to sperm and ova and impairs implantation. This method is over 99% effective in preventing pregnancy.

Option A, 'Avoiding sex during fertile period', is not the most effective method as the effectiveness depends on the woman's menstrual cycle regularity and ability to correctly identify her fertile period.

Option B, 'Inducing endometrial inflammation', is not a standalone method of contraception. While it is a mechanism by which some contraceptive methods (like the copper IUD) work, it is not a contraceptive method itself.

The patient has a personal history of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which contraindicates the use of estrogen-containing contraceptives (eg, combined oral contraceptives, transdermal patch, vaginal ring) as estrogen increases the risk for recurrent VTE. The patient also requests a nonhormonal method, which rules out progestin-only pills, injectable medroxyprogesterone, and hormonal IUDs. The patient wants the most effective, reversible, nonhormonal contraceptive method and this would be a copper intrauterine device (IUD). IUDs are T-shaped devices inserted into the uterine cavity where they provide long-term contraception (Copper IUDs for up to 10 years). Copper IUDs release copper ions, which are toxic to sperm, and cause endometrial inflammation, impairing implantation. IUDs can be removed at any time, with a rapid return to fertility. 

Option A: Avoiding sex during the fertile period (fertility awareness methods) requires careful tracking of menstrual cycles and is less reliable than other methods.

Option B: Inducing endometrial inflammation is a mechanism of action for copper IUDs. However, the question states that the patient wants to try the most effective method and the efficacy of copper IUDs is not due to inducing endometrial inflammation alone.

Option D: Thickening of cervical mucus is a mechanism of action for hormonal methods like the progesterone-only pill or IUD.

Option E: Preventing ovulation is a mechanism of action for hormonal methods like combined oral contraceptives and progestin-only pills, but this patient wants a non-hormonal method. 

Therefore, although the literal interpretation of option C (eg, tubal ligation) is a surgical procedure and not reversible, its mechanism 'Closing off the fallopian tubes' most closely aligns with the action of IUDs, which block sperm migration up the fallopian tubes."

9271,"The patient in the scenario presents with a new-onset systolic ejection murmur, diarrhea following a raw food diet, and a recent history of travel to Uganda, a region endemic for parasitic infections. Together, these suggest the diagnosis of Carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid syndrome is caused by an overabundance of serotonin, which is usually metabolized in the liver; however, hepatic metastases or right-to-left shunts (eg, patent foramen ovale, atrial septal defect) can bypass the liver's first-pass metabolism and allow serotonin to enter systemic circulation. The serotonin then causes flushing, diarrhea, bronchoconstriction, and right-sided heart disease (eg, tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonic stenosis). A systolic ejection murmur heard loudest at the left second intercostal space is indicative of pulmonic stenosis, which is commonly seen in Carcinoid syndrome. Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient would be a low platelet count (option A), as serotonin is stored in platelets and is released upon their activation, leading to a decrease in platelet count.

Option B, a positive hydrogen breath test, would suggest lactose intolerance or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, but these conditions do not explain the new-onset murmur. 

Option C, decreased levels of chromogranin A, would suggest a decrease in neuroendocrine tumor activity, which is inconsistent with this patient's symptoms.

9300,"The correct answer is A. Wet mount preparation.

This patient's mucopurulent and malodorous cervical discharge, inflamed and friable cervix (cervicitis), and history of unprotected intercourse is concerning for infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis. These sexually transmitted infections are the most common cause of cervicitis in sexually active women. Other symptoms of cervicitis can include intermenstrual or postcoital bleeding. Many patients, especially those with chlamydial infection, are asymptomatic.

The best initial diagnostic test for cervicitis is a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) of urine or a cervical/vaginal swab. NAATs can detect both gonorrhea and chlamydia, have the highest sensitivity and specificity of all tests for these pathogens, and are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as the test of choice. However, NAAT results may take days to come back, and the patient is pregnant and might have a condition that could potentially affect her pregnancy. Therefore, it is also appropriate to perform a wet mount as the initial test to look for other causes of her symptoms (eg, bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis) that could be treated promptly.

Option B: The amine test (ie, whiff test) involves the addition of potassium hydroxide to vaginal discharge to detect the fishy odor characteristic of bacterial vaginosis. This patient's foul-smelling discharge and history of unprotected intercourse make bacterial vaginosis possible. However, her inflamed and friable cervix is more suggestive of cervicitis.

Option C: Urine analysis and culture would be the appropriate initial step in management if this patient had symptoms of a urinary tract infection (eg, dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain), but she does not.

Option D: NAAT is the most sensitive and specific test for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis, the most common pathogens causing cervicitis.

9334,"This patient's presentation of confusion, lethargy, seizure activity, and hyponatremia (Na+ 125 mEq/L; reference range 135-145 mEq/L) is suggestive of severe symptomatic hyponatremia. Hyponatremia is defined as a serum sodium <135 mEq/L and results from an imbalance in water homeostasis, either due to water retention, sodium loss, or a combination of both. The most common causes are hypovolemic (eg, vomiting, diarrhea, diuretics), euvolemic (eg, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, psychogenic polydipsia, hypothyroidism, glucocorticoid deficiency), or hypervolemic (eg, congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, renal failure). Symptoms of hyponatremia are predominantly neurologic and include headache, lethargy, restlessness, disorientation, psychosis, and seizures. This is due to the movement of water into brain cells and resultant cerebral edema. Severe, symptomatic hyponatremia is a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment to prevent life-threatening complications (eg, coma, respiratory arrest, death). The mainstay of treatment is hypertonic (3%) saline (Choice B), which rapidly increases the serum sodium concentration and reduces cerebral edema.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is C. Increase the serum sodium slowly with normal saline solution. This patientâ??s confusion, lethargy, and seizures are due to hyponatremia (serum sodium <135 mEq/L). Chronic hyponatremia (developing over >48 hours) should be corrected slowly using normal (0.9%) saline, with a target correction rate <10 mEq/L in the first 24 hours and <18 mEq/L in the first 48 hours. 
This patient's frequent diarrhea likely caused volume depletion and stimulated ADH secretion, leading to water retention and hyponatremia. Other causes of hyponatremia include hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, and medications (eg, diuretics), but these are less likely in this patient based on the history and laboratory results.

Let's discuss why other options are incorrect:

Option A: This patient does have a low serum potassium level, but this is not the cause of her symptoms. Therefore, increasing the serum potassium with a potassium solution is not the most appropriate treatment at this time.

Option B: Hypertonic saline is usually reserved for patients with severe, symptomatic hyponatremia who have not responded to normal saline. This patient's hyponatremia is mild to moderate, and she should initially be treated with normal saline.

Option D: Fluid restriction is typically used for treatment of asymptomatic, chronic hyponatremia, especially if it is caused by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). But this patient is symptomatic, so fluid restriction alone would not be enough to correct her hyponatremia.

Option E: The patient's seizures are likely due to her hyponatremia. Once her sodium levels are corrected, she should not continue to have seizures, and therefore she does not need maintenance anti-epileptic medications."

9365,"The correct answer is A. Protein A.

The patient's postoperative fever, knee pain, swelling, and erythema are concerning for prosthetic joint infection, a serious complication that can occur within 2 years of joint replacement.

In this case, however, the organism grew on mannitol salt agar without a color change, indicating that it is a nonfermenter, such as Staphylococcus epidermidis.

S. epidermidis is a component of the normal skin flora and is the most common cause of infection associated with indwelling medical devices, including prosthetic joints and intravascular catheters. The key virulence factor is the production of an extracellular slime layer (biofilm), which is composed of polysaccharide intercellular adhesin or poly-N-acetylglucosamine (ie, exopolysaccharides). This biofilm allows the bacteria to adhere to the prosthetic material, protects the organisms from host defenses, and makes them extremely resistant to antibiotics.

Enterobiasis is a common helminthic infection caused by Enterobius vermicularis. The adult worm lives in the colon and rectum of infected individuals. At night, the female worm migrates from the anus to lay eggs in the perianal region, causing local irritation and itching. Scratching the perianal region can lead to contamination of the patient's fingers and nails with pinworm eggs. These eggs can then be ingested due to nail biting or handling of food. In females, eggs may also be found in the vulva due to retroinfection or migration of the worm.

Microscopy of an adhesive tape that was applied to the perianal region shows multiple ova. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Option: {'A': 'Praziquantel', 'B': 'Ivermectin', 'C': 'Albendazole', 'D': 'Pyrantel pamoate', 'E': 'Supportive therapy'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is D. Pyrantel pamoate.

This woman's mild itching in the vulva and anal region and the finding of multiple ova on perianal adhesive tape microscopy are indicative of enterobiasis (pinworm infection), a common helminthic infection in the United States. Enterobius vermicularis ova can be deposited on perianal skin due to the nocturnal migration of adult female worms from the anus to lay eggs, causing perianal pruritus. Because eggs can survive for up to 3 weeks on skin, clothing, bedding, toys, and bathroom fixtures, autoinfection and person-to-person transmission can easily occur through ingestion of contaminated fomites. Diagnosis is usually made with the ""tape test,"" which involves applying adhesive tape or a pinworm paddle to the perianal skin in the morning before washing or defecating and then visualizing the tape or paddle under a microscope for eggs.

Management of E vermicularis infection involves administration of a single dose of either albendazole or pyrantel pamoate, followed by a second dose 2 weeks later to prevent recurrence due to autoinfection. However, because albendazole is pregnancy category C and should be used during pregnancy only if the benefits outweigh the risks, the treatment of choice in pregnant women is pyrantel pamoate, a pregnancy category B drug.

Praziquantel (option A) is used for the treatment of schistosomiasis, tapeworm infections, and other fluke infections.
Ivermectin (option B) is used for the treatment of onchocerciasis, strongyloidiasis, and scabies.
Albendazole (option C) is a treatment option for enterobiasis, but it is not the treatment of choice in pregnant women due to potential harm to the fetus.
Supportive therapy (option E) would not be appropriate because specific anti-parasitic treatment is available and typically well-tolerated."

This patient's burn is described as dry, white, and leathery, which is indicative of a full-thickness (third-degree) burn. Full-thickness burns involve the entire dermis and damage nerves, resulting in insensate skin. The skin may appear pale, white, brown, or black. The initial management of a burn patient includes establishing the airway, providing pain relief, and assessing the burn's extent and depth. Pain management is critical in the initial management of burn injuries, often achieved with opioids for moderate to severe pain.

Now, let's explain why the other options are incorrect:

Option A: Bacitracin is a topical antibiotic commonly used for minor skin wounds but it's not enough for severe burns.

Option C: Mafenide acetate is a topical antimicrobial agent used in burns to prevent and treat burn wound sepsis. However, it's not the priority in this case. Pain control is crucial before applying topical antimicrobials.

Option D: Excision and grafting is a treatment for severe burns, but it's not the immediate treatment. Pain control comes first before surgical interventions.

Option E: Amputation would be considered in cases of severe burns with nonviable tissue and unsuccessful attempts at revascularization.

Topical antibiotics such as mafenide and silver sulfadiazine are typically used to prevent infection in burns. Bacitracin (option A) is an antibiotic, but it is not typically used for burns because it does not penetrate eschar. Mafenide acetate (option C) is a common antibiotic used for burns, but it is not necessarily the first step in management. Excision and grafting (option D) may be necessary in the future for a full-thickness burn, but it is not the first step in management.

The clinical picture is suggestive of hypercalcemia due to primary hyperparathyroidism. This condition is characterized by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) from one or more of the parathyroid glands, which leads to hypercalcemia. Constipation, abdominal pain, and decreased appetite are symptoms of hypercalcemia. Other symptoms can include fatigue, depression, muscle weakness, and polyuria. The woman's high serum calcium and PTH levels support this diagnosis.

Let's discuss why the other options are incorrect:

A. Primary hypothyroidism: Although this patient has a history of hypothyroidism, her symptoms and labs are not consistent with this condition. Hypothyroidism would present with symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and constipation, but it would not cause hypercalcemia and high PTH levels.

C. Vitamin A toxicity: Although vitamin A toxicity can cause a variety of symptoms, hypercalcemia is typically not one of them. Symptoms of vitamin A toxicity can include dry skin, hair loss, and vision changes. This patient's symptoms and labs do not suggest vitamin A toxicity.

D. Excess calcium carbonate intake: Although this could theoretically cause hypercalcemia, it would not elevate PTH levels. In fact, high levels of calcium in the blood would normally suppress PTH secretion.

E. Vitamin D toxicity: Vitamin D toxicity can cause hypercalcemia, but again, this would normally suppress PTH secretion, not elevate it. Symptoms of vitamin D toxicity might include anorexia, nausea, and polyuria."

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is C. 'Sloughed tubular cells within tubular lumen'

This boy's recurrent symptoms of fever and flank pain are suggestive of repeated upper urinary tract infections (ie, pyelonephritis). Pyelonephritis often results from ascending infection of the lower urinary tract and is more common in females due to their shorter urethral length. However, in males, it can be associated with congenital abnormalities that cause urinary stasis or reflux, such as vesicoureteral reflux or posterior urethral valves. Urinalysis typically shows leukocytes, white blood cell casts, and bacteria. The nitrite test is often positive due to reduction of nitrate to nitrite by gram-negative bacteria. Recurrent infection can lead to chronic pyelonephritis, which is characterized by renal scarring, blunted calyx, and overlying cortical thinning. It often results in hypertension and can progress to end-stage renal disease. Microscopic examination typically shows thyroidization of tubules. This is due to chronic inflammation and fibrosis leading to tubular atrophy, and the tubules become filled with casts that resemble thyroid follicles. This would be the most likely finding in a renal biopsy of this boy.

Option A, Segmental sclerosis and hyalinosis, is characteristic of Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis, a cause of nephrotic syndrome, not recurrent UTIs.

Option B, Normal glomeruli with accumulated lipid in proximal convoluted tubular cells, is characteristic of Fabry disease, a rare X-linked recessive lysosomal storage disorder.

Option D, Tubules containing eosinophilic casts, is seen more in conditions like acute tubular necrosis and not recurrent UTIs.

9438,"The patient's history of episodic right upper abdominal pain after consuming fatty foods, radiating to the tip of the right scapula, suggests gallstone disease (cholelithiasis). The current presentation with severe abdominal pain and vomiting is due to gallstone ileus, a rare complication of cholelithiasis. Gallstone ileus occurs when a large gallstone erodes into the gastrointestinal tract and then impacts, usually at the ileocecal valve, causing small bowel obstruction. The diagnosis is confirmed by CT scan, which typically shows signs of small bowel obstruction (eg, dilated loops of small bowel, air-fluid levels) and a gallstone in the bowel lumen.

Option B, pancreatitis, is unlikely as the patient does not have a history of alcohol abuse or hypertriglyceridemia, which are the most common causes of pancreatitis. Furthermore, the pain of pancreatitis is typically epigastric, radiating to the back, and is associated with nausea and vomiting.

In patients without a surgical history, common causes of small bowel obstruction include hernias and malignancies, which this patient also denies. Other less common causes include Crohn's disease (stricture or adhesion), gallstone ileus, and intussusception.

The patient's presentation is suggestive of cholestasis due to an unknown etiology. He is experiencing abdominal pruritus, which is a common symptom in cholestatic liver diseases. Pruritus occurs due to accumulation of bile salts in the skin. It is also worth noting that the patient might be experiencing jaundice, which is another common symptom of cholestasis. However, the patient is not sure if his skin has yellowed. 

Option D, polycythemia vera, is the least compatible with the patient's provided history. Polycythemia vera is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by overproduction of red blood cells. It does not typically cause pruritus or jaundice unless the patient has been treated with phlebotomy, which can lead to iron deficiency and thus cause pruritus.

Option C, scabies, is a parasitic infection that causes intense pruritus. And option E, lichen planus, is a skin condition that can cause pruritus. Therefore, all of these conditions are compatible with the patient's presentation.

Polycythemia vera is a rare disease in which the body makes too many red blood cells, making the blood thicker than normal and causing clots, strokes, and heart attacks. It can also cause the spleen and liver to enlarge. However, this patient's symptoms of pruritus (itching) and potential jaundice (yellowing of the skin) along with normal liver morphology suggest a disease process affecting the liver or biliary system, not an overproduction of red blood cells.

Option A: Portal vein thrombosis can cause pruritus and jaundice due to blockage of blood flow through the liver, leading to liver dysfunction.

Option B: Postherpetic neuralgia is a complication of shingles (herpes zoster) and can cause pruritus, but is usually associated with a painful rash which is not mentioned in this patient's history.

Option C: Scabies is a skin infestation that can cause severe pruritus, but would not explain potential jaundice.

Option E: Lichen planus is a skin disease that can cause pruritus, but again would not explain potential jaundice. 

Lastly, important to consider that pruritus can be a symptom of cholestasis, a condition where bile cannot flow from the liver to the duodenum. This can occur in conditions like primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, gallstones etc. From the given options, only portal vein thrombosis could result in cholestasis, given that it blocks the blood supply to the liver.

9453,"This patient's presentation of jaundice, confusion, and coagulopathy after an acute rise in transaminases suggests acute liver failure (ALF). ALF can be caused by many etiologies such as viruses, drugs, and toxins. In this patient, hepatitis B, acetaminophen toxicity, and ischemic hepatitis due to cocaine use are the main considerations. However, the acetaminophen level is not in the toxic range, making acetaminophen toxicity less likely. Although cocaine use can cause ischemic hepatitis due to its vasoconstrictive properties, the positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) suggests this is an acute hepatitis B infection leading to ALF. 

The next step in management would be to evaluate for liver transplantation (Option C). ALF due to hepatitis B is typically managed with antiviral therapy, such as tenofovir or entecavir, but these treatments do not decrease short-term mortality in fulminant hepatitis B.

This patient has acute hepatitis B infection, as evidenced by her clinical presentation (eg, jaundice, confusion from hepatic encephalopathy) and laboratory results (eg, elevated transaminases). She also has a positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and negative hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), indicating active infection. In patients with acute hepatitis B, antiviral therapy (eg, tenofovir) is typically not required because most individuals (95%) will clear the infection spontaneously. Antiviral therapy is generally reserved for patients who develop severe acute hepatitis B, defined as any of the following: serum bilirubin >10 mg/dL, prothrombin time >3 seconds prolonged, or hepatic encephalopathy.

Along with supportive care, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient who has severe disease is therapy with pegylated interferon. Interferon therapy is typically given for 24-48 weeks and works by inhibiting viral replication and stimulating host immune response to clear the virus.

9456,"The answer is C, 'Increased peripheral vascular resistance'.

Epinephrine is a catecholamine that primarily binds to alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. It has a vasodilatory effect on skeletal muscle blood vessels (via beta-2 adrenergic receptors) and a vasoconstrictive effect on skin and splanchnic blood vessels (via alpha-1 adrenergic receptors). Phenoxybenzamine is a non-selective alpha adrenergic antagonist, which means it blocks the actions of endogenous catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) at alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. Therefore, after administration of phenoxybenzamine, epinephrine's vasoconstrictive effects are inhibited, thus the vasodilatory effects predominate, leading to decreased total peripheral resistance.

Option A is incorrect because epinephrine, via beta-2 adrenergic receptors, actually stimulates glycogen breakdown (glycogenolysis) in both liver and muscle to increase blood glucose levels.

Option B is incorrect because the secretion of aqueous humor in the eye is not directly influenced by the autonomic nervous system or catecholamines. 

Option D is incorrect because epinephrine, via alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, inhibits insulin secretion. Even if this action was blocked by phenoxybenzamine, there would be no reason for insulin secretion to increase because blood glucose levels would not be elevated.

Option E is incorrect because the pressure inside the bladder is not directly influenced by the autonomic nervous system or catecholamines.

Epinephrine is a non-selective adrenergic agonist that stimulates both alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors. Its effects can include increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, bronchial relaxation, and increased release of glucose from the liver, among others. 

Phenoxybenzamine is a non-selective alpha-adrenergic antagonist. By blocking the alpha-adrenergic receptors, it prevents the actions of catecholamines such as norepinephrine and epinephrine which would normally cause vasoconstriction. Therefore, after the administration of phenoxybenzamine, the beta-adrenergic effects of the epinephrine dominate, leading to vasodilation and decreased total peripheral resistance.

However, the question asks for the effects of epinephrine before the administration of phenoxybenzamine. Therefore, the most noticeable effect would be the stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors by epinephrine leading to increased peripheral vascular resistance (Option C).

Option A, B, D, and E are incorrect. Epinephrine promotes the breakdown of muscle glycogen to glucose (glycogenolysis), so it would not lead to a decreased breakdown of muscle glycogen (Option A).

9472,"This patient with chronic cigarette use and a positive tuberculin skin test has a chronic asymptomatic infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (latent tuberculosis infection [LTBI]). The patient's findings are consistent with LTBI, as he has no symptoms (eg, cough, hemoptysis, weight loss, night sweats) of active tuberculosis (TB) and a normal chest x-ray. LTBI is an asymptomatic, non-infectious state without disease manifestations. However, approximately 5%-10% of individuals with LTBI will progress to active disease if not treated, especially those with risk factors such as diabetes, HIV infection, or cigarette smoking (as in this patient). LTBI is treated with isoniazid (INH) for 9 months to reduce the risk of progression to active TB. Because it is a single drug regimen, there is less risk of hepatotoxicity compared with the multiple-drug regimens used to treat active TB. 

Option A (Isoniazid and rifampin) is part of the regimen for active TB, not latent TB.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is E: 'Repeat sputum culture and smear'. 

This patient's presentation is suggestive of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). He has a positive tuberculin skin test (TST), evidenced by the induration diameter of 12 mm. The recommended interpretation of TSTs considers both the size of the induration and the person's risk of being infected with TB and of progression to disease if infected. Indurations of =10 mm are considered positive in recent immigrants from high-prevalence countries, injection drug users, residents and employees of high-risk congregate settings, mycobacteriology laboratory personnel, persons with clinical conditions that place them at high risk, children <4 years of age, and infants, children, and adolescents exposed to adults in high-risk categories. As this patient has been a heavy smoker for 30 years, it places him at a higher risk for tuberculosis.

However, a positive TST or interferon-? release assay result only indicates that a person has been infected with TB; it does not distinguish LTBI from active disease. All persons with a positive test should undergo a chest radiograph to evaluate for active disease. His chest radiograph does not show any of the typical signs of active tuberculosis such as cavitations, upper lobe infiltrates, or miliary pattern. Therefore, active TB is less likely in this patient.

The Ziehl-Neelsen stain of the sputum sample was negative, which is not uncommon in early or less-severe disease, so repeating the sputum culture and smear would provide a better chance of detecting the bacteria if they are present.

The other options of starting various TB treatment regimens (options A-D) would be incorrect at this time because there has not been a confirmed diagnosis of active tuberculosis. These treatments have potential side effects and should only be initiated when appropriate."

9508,"This patient's knee pain, aggravated by movement and relieved by rest, and physical examination findings of crepitus and joint stiffness, are consistent with osteoarthritis (OA). OA, the most common joint disorder, is a degenerative disease that often affects the hands, knees, hips, and spine. Risk factors include age >40, female gender, obesity, and joint injury. Patients typically present with deep, achy joint pain that is worsened by use and improved with rest. On physical examination, there may be crepitus with joint motion, bony enlargement, and mild synovitis. As OA progresses, patients may experience decreased range of motion and joint instability. The diagnosis is clinical, supported by x-ray findings of joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis (increased bone formation), osteophyte formation, and subchondral cysts.

Initial treatment of OA involves conservative measures including weight loss and physical therapy. If these measures fail to alleviate symptoms, the next step in therapy is the use of oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen (Choice B). NSAIDs have analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, although patients with OA, which is primarily a noninflammatory condition, may not require the anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, acetaminophen, a less potent analgesic that lacks anti-inflammatory effects, is often tried first.

The appropriate first-line treatment for OA is non-pharmacological management, such as weight loss, physical therapy, and activity modification. If these measures fail, the first-line pharmacological treatment is acetaminophen or oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This patient has already tried over-the-counter NSAIDs with no relief. She also has type 2 diabetes mellitus, and NSAIDs can worsen glycemic control and adversely affect renal function. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy in this case would be a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitor, such as celecoxib (option D).

9510,"Without the photograph of the lesion, it's difficult to give a precise answer. However, based on the given information, one could make assumptions. 

Generally, in a young, otherwise healthy patient with a relatively recent wound that shows no signs of infection, primary closure ('D') would be the first choice if possible. 

Primary closure is the easiest, least risky, and most cost-effective method of wound management. It is the process of bringing the edges of the wound together with sutures, staples, or adhesive tape. This method minimizes scarring and speeds healing by reducing the wound surface area.

Other options:

Option 'A', free tissue transfer flap, is used for large, complex wounds that are not suitable for primary closure. This is a more invasive procedure that involves transplanting tissue from one part of the body to another. Without additional information about the size and complexity of the wound, it's hard to say that this would be necessary. 

Option 'B', full-thickness skin graft, involves transplanting the entire thickness of the dermis from a donor site to the wound. This is typically used for wounds that cannot be closed primarily and are too large or located in an area that does not allow for easy stretching of the skin.

Option 'C', musculocutaneous flap, is used when the wound involves not just the skin but also underlying structures such as muscle and bone. This does not appear to be the case based on the information given.

This involves suturing the wound closed, allowing it to heal naturally. This method is often the first line approach for clean, small to medium-sized wounds.

However, wound management really depends on the size, depth, location, and condition of the wound which I can't determine without seeing the image. Here are general principles for the other options:

Option A: Free tissue transfer flap is not the best choice for this case as it is a complex procedure usually reserved for large wounds that involve loss of substantial skin and underlying tissues, not typically needed for a simple ankle wound.

Option B: Full-thickness skin graft involves transferring both the epidermis and the entire thickness of the dermis from a healthy area to the wound area. This is more suitable for wounds that cannot be closed primarily but are still relatively small.

Option C: Musculocutaneous flap is usually reserved for large wounds involving loss of deeper structures like muscle, not typically indicated in a simple skin wound.

Option E: Split-thickness skin graft involves transfer of the epidermis and a portion of the dermis. Like a full-thickness graft, this is more suitable for larger wounds that cannot be closed directly, or wounds in areas where contracture could cause functional impairment.

9517,"The correct answer is D. Reactive gliosis and vascular proliferation.

One year after a stroke, the infarcted area undergoes a process of liquefactive necrosis and the damaged tissue is cleared by macrophages. After this process, reactive gliosis and vascular proliferation occur as part of the repair process. Gliosis is a nonspecific reactive change of glial cells in response to damage to the central nervous system. In most cases, it involves the proliferation or hypertrophy of several different types of glial cells, including astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes.

Option A (Red neurons) are an acute finding, seen as early as 12 hours after an ischemic stroke. Option B (Necrosis and neutrophils) are seen within the first few days after a stroke. Option C (Macrophages) are seen within the first few weeks after a stroke. Option E (Cyst formed by astrocyte processes) is seen in later stages, around 2 weeks to several years after a stroke.

A stroke represents an infarction in the brain, typically caused by a thrombus or embolus that occludes blood flow to a portion of the brain. The timeline of changes following a cerebral infarction is well established. The first microscopic change is in 12-24 hours, with red neurons characterized by shrinkage of the cell body, eosinophilia of the cytoplasm, and loss of Nissl substance. Neutrophils begin to appear by 24 hours and peak at 72 hours (Option B). Macrophages, which phagocytose the dead tissue, peak at 2 weeks to a month (Option C). Reactive gliosis and vascular proliferation, which appear after 2 weeks (Option D), represent the scar formation process in the CNS, characterized by both proliferation of astrocytes (gliosis) and small blood vessels (vascular proliferation). Over years, a cystic space might form in the area of infarction, often lined by reactive astrocytes (Option E). However, as the patient's previous stroke occurred 1 year ago, the most prominent histologic finding would be reactive gliosis (astrocytic scar) and vascular proliferation. 

Option A: The red neurons are seen in the first 12-24 hours after an ischemic event and are the first sign of irreversible damage.

Option B: Necrosis and neutrophils are seen acutely after an ischemic event (peaking at 72 hours).

Option C: Macrophages help clean up the necrotic tissue and peak at 2 weeks to a month.

9526,"This patient's presentation of fever, tachycardia, hypotension, confusion, and suprapubic tenderness suggests septic shock due to urinary tract infection. Sepsis leads to systemic vasodilation and capillary leak. This, combined with decreased fluid intake (due to malaise and weakness), results in intravascular volume depletion. The initial response to hypotension and hypoperfusion is an increase in heart rate and cardiac output (stroke volume x heart rate). However, as sepsis progresses, myocardial depression can occur (due to circulating cytokines and direct myocardial invasion by pathogens), leading to reduced cardiac output. The combination of reduced intravascular volume (due to capillary leak and vasodilation) and decreased cardiac output results in decreased preload, as would be reflected by a reduced pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). In addition, the systemic vasodilation in sepsis leads to decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR).
Mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is a measure of the balance between oxygen delivery and consumption. In the early stages of sepsis, SvO2 is usually normal or increased due to two main factors: (1) increased cardiac output leading to increased oxygen delivery and (2) impaired cellular uptake of oxygen (""cytopathic hypoxia"") leading to decreased oxygen consumption.

Her medications include metformin and glyburide, atorvastatin, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide. At presentation, her oral temperature is 38.9Ã?Â°C (102.2Ã?Â°F), the pulse is 122/min, blood pressure is 93/40 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. On physical examination, she is breathing rapid shallow breaths but does not have any rales or crackles on pulmonary auscultation. No murmurs are heard on cardiac auscultation and femoral pulses are bounding. Her skin is warm, flushed, and dry to touch. There is trace bilateral pedal edema present. Her abdomen is soft and non-distended, but she has some involuntary guarding on palpation of the suprapubic region. ECG shows normal amplitude sinus tachycardia without evidence of ST-segment changes or T-wave inversions. Which of the following would most likely be the relative pulmonary artery catheterization measurements of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), mixed venous oxygen saturation (SaO2), calculated cardiac output (CO), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) in this patient?
Option: {'A': 'Decreased PCWP; normal SaO2; decreased CO; and decreased SVR', 'B': 'Decreased PCWP; decreased SaO2; decreased CO; increased SVR', 'C': 'Normal PCWP; normal SaO2; increased CO; decreased SVR', 'D': 'Decreased PCWP; slightly increased SaO2; increased CO; decreased SVR', 'E': 'Increased PCWP; decreased SaO2; decreased CO; increased SVR'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is C: Normal PCWP; normal SaO2; increased CO; decreased SVR. 

This patient's symptoms of confusion, malaise, nausea, and lower abdominal pain, along with her history of recurrent urinary tract infections and physical exam findings of fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and suprapubic tenderness, are suggestive of urosepsis. Sepsis is a systemic response to infection that can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death. The cardiovascular response to sepsis includes initial vasodilation and increased cardiac output (CO). 

This is mediated by endogenous nitric oxide and other vasodilators, leading to a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR). The decrease in SVR is reflected clinically as warm and flushed skin. Despite adequate or increased CO, tissues may still be hypoperfused due to microvascular abnormalities, leading to lactic acidosis and a decreased mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2). However, the early stages of sepsis may not show a decrease in SvO2 because the increase in CO can compensate for the metabolic demands. 

Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) is a measure of left atrial pressure and is usually normal in sepsis, unless there is preexisting cardiac disease or sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy. This patient's normal breath sounds and absence of rales suggest that her left atrial pressure is not significantly elevated, ie, her PCWP is most likely normal.

The other options are incorrect because they do not accurately represent the hemodynamic profile of a patient with early sepsis. For example, options A, B, and D suggest a decreased PCWP, which would be more suggestive of hypovolemic shock. Option E suggests an increased SVR, which is not typical of sepsis, where vasodilation predominates. 

It's also important to note that despite the patient's old age and multiple comorbidities, sepsis can affect anyone and timely recognition and treatment are crucial to improve outcomes."
9532,"The correct answer is A. 'Left shift of the oxyhemoglobin curve'.

The patient's presentation is suggestive of a condition called pyruvate kinase deficiency. Pyruvate kinase is an enzyme involved in the final step of glycolysis, which converts phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate. In pyruvate kinase deficiency, this conversion is impaired, resulting in a decreased production of ATP. Red blood cells rely solely on glycolysis for their energy needs, so a decrease in ATP production can lead to hemolytic anemia, as suggested by the patient's elevated lactate dehydrogenase and decreased haptoglobin levels.

A left shift of the oxyhemoglobin curve occurs in this condition because of increased levels of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG), a byproduct of the Rapoport-Luebering shunt that is upregulated when pyruvate kinase is deficient. Increased 2,3-BPG decreases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, promoting oxygen unloading in tissues. However, the high levels of 2,3-BPG in pyruvate kinase deficiency are outweighed by the decrease in ATP, which stabilizes the deoxy form of hemoglobin and causes a left shift in the oxyhemoglobin curve (increased oxygen affinity).

Option B is incorrect because a right shift of the oxyhemoglobin curve, which would decrease the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, would occur with increased 2,3-BPG. However, as mentioned above, the decrease in ATP outweighs this effect in pyruvate kinase deficiency.

Option C and D, broadening and narrowing of the oxyhemoglobin curve, are not typical changes seen in metabolic conditions affecting hemoglobin.

Option E is incorrect because, in pyruvate kinase deficiency, there is a decrease in ATP availability due to impaired glycolysis.","stop","the correct answer is a.","A","B","USMLE question: A mother brings her newborn baby to the pediatrician after noting that his skin looks yellow.

Option: {'A': 'Left shift of the oxyhemoglobin curve', 'B': 'Right shift of the oxyhemoglobin curve', 'C': 'Broadening of the oxyhemoglobin curve', 'D': 'Narrowing of the oxyhemoglobin curve', 'E': 'Increased ATP availability'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's findings of neonatal jaundice, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and decreased haptoglobin suggest hemolysis, likely due to pyruvate kinase deficiency. Pyruvate kinase is an enzyme in the glycolytic pathway that converts phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate and generates ATP. A deficiency in this enzyme decreases ATP production in red blood cells. Red blood cells rely on ATP for maintenance of the sodium-potassium ATPase, which keeps the cell in its normal, discoid shape. Without sufficient ATP, cells lose their ability to maintain this shape and become echinocytes (spiculated cells), which are then removed from circulation by the spleen, leading to hemolysis. Hemoglobin oxygen affinity is mainly affected by changes in 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) concentration. Because 2,3-BPG is synthesized in the Rapoport-Luebering pathway (a shunt of glycolysis), decreased glycolysis due to pyruvate kinase deficiency decreases 2,3-BPG production. This leads to a left shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve (Option A) and increased oxygen affinity, potentially impairing oxygen delivery to tissues.

Option B would be incorrect as a right shift of the oxyhemoglobin curve, signifies decreased oxygen affinity which is not expected in this case. Options C and D are incorrect as the oxyhemoglobin curve doesn't undergo ""broadening"" or ""narrowing"". Option E is incorrect as ATP availability will be decreased not increased in this scenario."

9551,"The correct answer is B: 17-Î±-hydroxylase deficiency.

This patient's hirsutism, amenorrhea, and acne suggest a disorder of sexual development due to an overproduction of androgens. Her normal blood pressure and lack of electrolyte abnormalities suggest that this is not due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency or 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency, which are the most common causes of congenital adrenal hyperplasia and would present with virilization and hypertension. 5-alpha-reductase deficiency typically presents in males with ambiguous genitalia. 

17-Î±-hydroxylase deficiency presents with hypertension and hypokalemia due to overproduction of mineralocorticoids, but this patient does not have these findings. Instead, 17-Î±-hydroxylase deficiency may present in females with primary amenorrhea and minimal development of secondary sexual characteristics because the enzyme deficiency leads to a lack of sex steroids, which are necessary for the development of these characteristics. 

In contrast, aromatase deficiency would present with virilization of the mother during pregnancy (as the placenta would be unable to convert androgens to estrogens), ambiguous genitalia in the female fetus, and multi-cystic ovaries in the affected female.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is 17-a-hydroxylase deficiency, a rare form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). 

Option B: '17-a-hydroxylase' is therefore the correct answer. 

This enzyme deficiency results in decreased sex steroid and cortisol synthesis, with a subsequent increase in mineralocorticoid precursors. Clinical features include hypertension (from the mineralocorticoid excess), hypokalemic alkalosis, sexual infantilism (ie, normal breast development but primary amenorrhea and scanty axillary and pubic hair), and ambiguous genitalia in genetic females (due to lack of exposure to estrogen).

Option A: '11-Ã?-hydroxylase' deficiency, another form of CAH, also presents with hypertension and ambiguous genitalia in genetic females. However, patients with this disorder have precocious puberty (secondary to increased adrenal androgen production), which is not seen in this patient.

Option C: 'Aromatase' deficiency leads to virilization of a genetic female and ambiguous genitalia at birth, not at puberty.

Option D: '21-hydroxylase' deficiency, the most common form of CAH, can present with ambiguous genitalia in newborn females, hyperkalemia, and salt wasting, or later in life with hirsutism, irregular menses, and infertility in females. Hypertension is not a feature.

Urinary obstruction can cause acute renal failure and be a predisposing factor for a UTI. In elderly patients, a UTI can present with non-specific findings such as altered mental status (without typical symptoms such as dysuria or frequency). Urinalysis in bacterial UTIs typically has a positive leukocyte esterase, which is the result of the detection of an enzyme produced by white blood cells option B.

Option A (Detection of an enzyme produced by red blood cells) is incorrect as RBCs do not produce enzymes that can be detected in urinalysis.

Option C (Detection of urinary nitrate conversion by gram-negative pathogens) and option E (Detection of an enzyme produced by gram-negative pathogens) are incorrect as these tests (nitrite test and bacterial enzyme detection) can support the diagnosis of a UTI but they are not consistently positive and thus are less reliable. 

Option D (Detection of urinary nitrate conversion by gram-positive pathogens) is incorrect as gram-positive bacteria do not typically convert nitrates to nitrites, which is what the nitrite test in urinalysis detects. This activity is characteristic of gram-negative bacteria.

9599,"The patient's symptoms of intermittent dysuria, pain with ejaculation, and lower abdominal pain, along with his exam findings of a tender prostate, are suggestive of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). This is a common urologic disease among middle-aged and older men. The disease is characterized by pain in the pelvic region lasting >3 months with or without lower urinary tract symptoms and/or sexual dysfunction, in the absence of urinary tract infection or other identifiable causes.

CP/CPPS is divided into two types: Type IIIA (inflammatory) and Type IIIB (non-inflammatory). Type IIIA is characterized by leukocytes in the prostatic secretions or post-prostatic massage urine specimen, whereas Type IIIB is characterized by lack of such findings. This patient's urinalysis showing trace leukocyte esterase (which can be a sign of inflammation) but no bacteria or nitrites (which would indicate a bacterial infection) suggests he has Type IIIA CP/CPPS. 

The first-line treatment for CP/CPPS is a multimodal approach that includes alpha blockers (e.g., tamsulosin), anti-inflammatories, and pelvic floor physical therapy. Alpha blockers are thought to work by relaxing the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, thus reducing bladder outlet obstruction. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Tamsulosin.

Option (B) Ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, would be indicated if there was a bacterial infection, which is not suggested in this case.
Option (C) Combining tamsulosin with ciprofloxacin would be unnecessary, as there's no evidence of bacterial infection.
Option (D) Finasteride, a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, is used for benign prostatic hyperplasia, which is characterized by an enlarged prostate (not found in this patient).
Option (E) Duloxetine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is typically used for stress urinary incontinence in women, not for prostatitis.","stop","therefore, the correct answer is (a) tamsulosin.","A","C","USMLE question: A 68-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with complaints of intermittent dysuria, pain with ejaculation, mild lower abdominal pain, and difficulty voiding for the last four months.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's voiding symptoms, pelvic pain, and sexual discomfort suggest a diagnosis of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). CP/CPPS is a common urologic disease, especially in middle-aged and elderly men. It presents with a variety of manifestations, including voiding symptoms (eg, straining, weak stream, hesitancy, urgency, frequency, nocturia), and discomfort or pain in the pelvic region (eg, perineal, testicular, penile, lower abdominal). In addition, patients can have sexual dysfunction (eg, erectile dysfunction, pain with ejaculation) and often report a decreased quality of life. The cause of CP/CPPS is unknown, but it is thought to result from a combination of factors, including voiding dysfunction, pelvic floor muscle tension, inflammation, and possibly psychological stress. There are no definitive diagnostic tests, and the diagnosis is clinical, based on symptoms, after exclusion of other conditions (eg, urinary tract infection, prostate cancer). Treatment of CP/CPPS involves multimodal therapy, including a1-adrenergic antagonists, anti-inflammatories, and pelvic floor physical therapy, to target the different contributing factors. a1-Adrenergic antagonists (eg, tamsulosin) are often used first-line due to presumed voiding dysfunction leading to high post-void residual urine, which may contribute to symptoms.

Option A is correct. Tamsulosin, an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, is a first-line treatment for CP/CPPS. It works by relaxing the muscles of the bladder and prostate, making it easier to urinate.

Option B is incorrect. Ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, would be used in cases where bacterial prostatitis is suspected. However, this patient's urinalysis is negative for bacteria, making an infectious cause unlikely.

Option C is incorrect because, as stated above, there's no evidence of bacterial infection, so using an antibiotic like ciprofloxacin isn't necessary.

Option D, Finasteride, is a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor used in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. It works by reducing the size of an enlarged prostate, but it's not typically used in the treatment of CP/CPPS.

9603,"The most appropriate recommendation is option B: 'Supplement her treatment with 3-4 mg of folate per day.' 

Lithium is a teratogen and is associated with a small but significant risk of cardiac malformations, especially Ebstein anomaly, in the fetus. Therefore, it is recommended that women of childbearing age who are taking lithium should supplement with 3-4 mg of folate per day to reduce the risk of neural tube defects. 

However, it's also important to balance the risks and benefits. Lithium discontinuation (option E) can lead to relapse of bipolar disorder. It's a challenging situation, but the risk of relapse (up to 50% in the first 15-18 weeks after discontinuation) would outweigh the risk of Ebstein anomaly (less than 1%). 

Option A: 'Continue her lithium monotherapy.' - This is not recommended without folate supplementation due to the increased risk of neural tube defects.

Option C: 'Add another drug to the regime but decrease each drugâ??s dosage.' - This is not recommended because adding another drug may increase the risk of drug interactions and potential side effects. 

Option D: 'Discontinue the lithium after delivery and before breastfeeding.' - This is not recommended because bipolar disorder needs to be managed continuously. Stopping treatment can lead to a relapse. 

The mental health of the mother is very important and if the lithium is stopped suddenly, this could result in a manic or depressive episode, potentially leading to a higher risk to both the mother and baby than the lithium itself. Therefore, a better approach is to manage the risks, which can be done with folate supplementation to decrease the risk of neural tube defects.","stop","the most appropriate recommendation is option b: 'supplement her treatment with 3-4 mg of folate per day.'","B","A","USMLE question: A 26-year-old woman presents to the clinic with complaints of missing her 'monthlies'.

She is on lithium for maintenance therapy of her bipolar disorder. She once took herself off of lithium, but she became so depressed that she had a suicide attempt shortly after. She is concerned about how lithium use might affect her fetus if she were pregnant.  What is the single most appropriate recommendation?

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is B. 'Supplement her treatment with 3-4 mg of folate per day.'

Explanation: Lithium is associated with an increased risk of cardiac malformations in infants, specifically Ebstein anomaly. However, it is very important to maintain the mood stability of the mother to avoid harm to both the mother and the baby. Hence, complete discontinuation is not recommended. Adding folate to her regimen can decrease the risk of neural tube defects, which are also a concern when using lithium in pregnancy.

Option A: Lithium monotherapy should not be continued without additional precautions, such as folate supplementation.

Option C: Adding another drug and decreasing the dosage of each drug is not an appropriate recommendation because this might not provide sufficient mood stabilization and could potentially expose the fetus to more risks associated with multiple drugs.

Option D: Discontinuation of lithium after delivery and before breastfeeding is not an immediate concern as lithium is not significantly secreted into breast milk. This option also does not address the potential risks during pregnancy.

Option E: Immediate discontinuation of lithium can lead to relapse of bipolar disorder, which could have serious consequences for the mother and, potentially, the fetus. Therefore, this is not the most appropriate recommendation."

9617,"This patient's symptoms are indicative of Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain (especially in the trunk), muscle wasting, moon facies, and purple striae. The pituitary adenoma, also known as Cushing's disease, is a common cause of Cushing's syndrome.

In this context, the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test is used to differentiate between different causes of Cushing's syndrome. Dexamethasone is a synthetic glucocorticoid that suppresses ACTH secretion from the pituitary gland. In a normal response to the test, high doses of dexamethasone suppress cortisol levels (indicating that the pituitary gland is responsive to negative feedback). 

Option A, 'Cortisol suppression, normal baseline ACTH', is correct. In Cushing's disease (pituitary adenoma), the pituitary adenoma cells still retain some sensitivity to cortisol feedback inhibition, and therefore high-dose dexamethasone can suppress cortisol secretion. The ACTH levels would be normal or high in Cushing's disease due to the overactive pituitary adenoma.

Options B, C, E suggest high baseline ACTH levels, which would be seen in Cushing's disease, but these options incorrectly suggest no cortisol suppression or elevation of cortisol above pre-test levels. These findings would be more suggestive of ectopic ACTH syndrome (e.g., due to a small cell lung cancer), where the non-pituitary tumor cells producing ACTH do not respond to negative feedback inhibition by cortisol.

Option D, 'No cortisol suppression, low baseline ACTH', suggests adrenal tumor (or adrenal hyperplasia) which is autonomous cortisol production by the adrenal glands, independent of ACTH, hence ACTH levels would be suppressed due to negative feedback.","stop","","A","B","USMLE question: A 50-year-old female is evaluated by her physician for recent weight gain.

Option: {'A': 'Cortisol suppression, normal baseline ACTH', 'B': 'Cortisol suppression, high baseline ACTH', 'C': 'No cortisol suppression, high baseline ACTH', 'D': 'No cortisol suppression, low baseline ACTH', 'E': 'Elevation of cortisol above pre-test levels, high baseline ACTH'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The answer is A: Cortisol suppression, normal baseline ACTH. 

This woman's signs and symptoms, which include truncal obesity, muscle wasting, moon facies, and purple striae on her abdomen, are suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, a condition characterized by an excess of cortisol. 

Pituitary adenoma, which is the most common cause of Cushing's syndrome, results in an increased production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by a benign tumor. This increased ACTH in turn stimulates the adrenal glands to produce more cortisol. 

In a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test, dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, is given to the patient and the body's cortisol production is then measured. Normally, dexamethasone should suppress the body's production of cortisol by negative feedback inhibition on ACTH production. However, in Cushing's disease (due to pituitary adenoma), the pituitary tumor producing ACTH is partially resistant to this negative feedback, but a high dose of dexamethasone can overcome this resistance and suppress cortisol production, hence 'Cortisol suppression'. 

For baseline ACTH levels, with a pituitary adenoma, you would expect ACTH levels to be 'Normal' or 'High'. In this case, the question asks for ""support"" for a pituitary adenoma, not confirm it, so 'Normal' baseline ACTH could still be associated with a pituitary adenoma.

The other options are incorrect because they represent different scenarios:

Option B: While high baseline ACTH is possible with a pituitary adenoma, the cortisol would be expected to suppress in a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test.

Option C: No cortisol suppression would suggest an adrenal tumor or ectopic ACTH production, and high baseline ACTH is common in ectopic ACTH syndrome.

Option D: No cortisol suppression and low baseline ACTH suggests adrenal tumor or adrenal hyperplasia.

Option E: Elevation of cortisol above pre-test levels is not typical of any form of Cushing's syndrome, and high baseline ACTH typically suggests ectopic ACTH production rather than a pituitary adenoma."
9628,"The correct answer is D. Bronchospasm.

The patient's symptoms and ECG findings are consistent with atrial fibrillation, a common arrhythmia characterized by a rapid, irregularly irregular rhythm and absent P waves on ECG. Management involves rate control (typically with a beta blocker or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker), anticoagulation, and potentially rhythm control.

The drug described in the question, which slows atrioventricular node conduction and inhibits voltage-dependent calcium entry into myocytes, is a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker such as verapamil or diltiazem.

9638,"The correct answer is C. 'Hypergranulosis'. 

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a complication that can occur after a stem cell or bone marrow transplant, in which the newly transplanted cells regard the recipient's body as foreign and attack it. It can be categorized as either acute or chronic.

Acute GVHD typically develops before day 100 post-transplantation, whereas chronic GVHD typically develops after day 100 post-transplantation. However, time frames are not always exact, and clinical presentation may better guide diagnosis.

In chronic GVHD, the skin is the most commonly affected organ. The histologic changes in chronic GVHD resemble those of lichen planus and scleroderma. The findings include vacuolar alteration of the basal layer, apoptotic keratinocytes, and lymphocytic infiltration of the superficial dermis. A characteristic finding is hypergranulosis, which is an exaggerated granular layer of the epidermis.

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a complication that can occur after a stem cell or bone marrow transplant from a donor. In GVHD, the donated stem cells (the graft) view the recipient's body (the host) as foreign and attack the host cells. 

GVHD can be acute or chronic and is diagnosed based on the time of onset and the clinical features. Acute GVHD typically develops within the first 100 days post-transplantation and is characterized histologically by diffuse vacuolization of the basal cell layer, lymphocytic infiltration of the superficial dermis, and complete separation of the dermis and epidermis. 

Chronic GVHD, which can occur beyond 100 days post-transplantation, is characterized by a variety of skin changes, including lichen planus-like lesions, sclerosis, and poikiloderma. On skin biopsy, chronic GVHD is characterized by focal vacuolization of the basal cell layer, hypergranulosis, and lymphocytic infiltration of the superficial dermis.

9665,"The correct answer is E. 'Q-tip test'

This patient's urinary incontinence with increased intra-abdominal pressure (eg, coughing, sneezing) and absence of urgency is suggestive of stress urinary incontinence (SUI). SUI is caused by urethral hypermobility or intrinsic sphincter deficiency. Risk factors for SUI include childbirth, age, and obesity. Urethral hypermobility, the more common cause, is due to weakened pelvic floor muscles that allow the bladder neck and urethra to descend with increased abdominal pressure, leading to urine leakage. This is often seen in patients with a history of multiple vaginal deliveries, obesity, and older age.

The Q-tip test can be used to diagnose urethral hypermobility. During the test, a lubricated, cotton-tipped swab is inserted into the urethra. With Valsalva or cough, an upward straining angle change of >30 degrees is diagnostic of urethral hypermobility.

SUI occurs when the intra-abdominal pressure exceeds the urethral sphincter pressure in the absence of bladder muscle contraction. Risk factors include conditions that increase intra-abdominal pressure (eg, obesity, chronic cough) and pelvic floor dysfunction (eg, multiparity, age). The stress incontinence is due to weakened pelvic floor muscles and ligaments causing a hypermobile urethra (urethral hypermobility) or due to an intrinsic sphincteric defect (ie, urethral sphincter cannot generate enough resting pressure to overcome increases in intra-abdominal pressure). 

The Q-tip test, or Option E, is a simple, inexpensive, and reliable method to determine urethral hypermobility. A lubricated, sterile cotton swab (Q-tip) is inserted into the bladder via the urethra and the angle of urethral inclination is measured at rest.

9699,"The correct answer is 'A: Golgi apparatus'. 

This is because the modification of proteins through the addition of N-linked oligosaccharides, such as the carbohydrate galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose implicated in alpha-gal allergy, primarily takes place in the Golgi apparatus. This organelle is responsible for the modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins for secretion. It acts like a post office of the cell, determining where proteins need to go and attaching the necessary 'address labels', which can include carbohydrate groups.

Option B, the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), is involved in the initial stages of protein synthesis and some protein modifications, but the addition of N-linked oligosaccharides is not one of its primary functions. 

Option C, the sodium-potassium pump, is a type of protein that helps maintain the electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane. It is not involved in protein synthesis or modification.

9705,"The correct answer is C: Bulimia nervosa.

Bulimia nervosa is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by inappropriate compensatory behaviors such as induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, fasting or excessive exercise. The induced vomiting can lead to parotid gland enlargement, dental caries (due to the acid in vomit eroding the tooth enamel) and calluses or scars on the dorsum of the hand (Russell's sign) from repeatedly inducing vomiting. Patients also have an intense fear of gaining weight and are often of normal weight or slightly overweight.

Anorexia nervosa, both restrictive type (option A) and purging type (option B), is characterized by intense fear of gaining weight and becoming fat, a distorted body image (believing they are overweight when they are underweight), and refusal to maintain a body weight over the minimum normal weight for their age and height. In the restrictive type, weight loss is achieved primarily through dieting, fasting, or excessive exercise, while in the purging type, weight loss is achieved through vomiting or misuse of laxatives. This patient's normal weight and absence of body image distortion make anorexia nervosa unlikely.

Bulimia nervosa is characterized by repeated episodes of binge eating followed by inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain, such as induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications, fasting, or excessive exercise. It is typically seen in normal-weight or slightly overweight young women. Physical examination may reveal signs of purging including parotid gland enlargement, dental caries (from gastric acid), and calluses or scars on the dorsal hand (Russell sign).

This patient's normal vital signs, calluses on the dorsal hand (indicating self-induced vomiting), and multiple dental caries (from recurrent exposure to gastric acid) suggest bulimia nervosa. Her history of sexual abuse is also a risk factor for this disorder.

Option A and B (Anorexia nervosa) are less probable because she doesn't appear to be underweight or malnourished. People with restrictive anorexia nervosa severely limit their food intake, while those with purging type use methods such as vomiting or misuse of laxatives to get rid of calories. But, both present a distorted body image and fear of gaining weight, which is not shown in the question. 

Option D (Obsessive compulsive disorder) could potentially coexist with an eating disorder, but there's no specific information given that points to this diagnosis.

Option 'A: Clonazepam' is a benzodiazepine that can be used in acute mania for rapid control of agitation but is not a first-line treatment. 

Option 'B: CT head' is not indicated in this case as her symptoms are more consistent with a psychiatric illness rather than a neurological problem.

Left renal vein entrapment by the superior mesenteric artery (ie, ""nutcracker syndrome"") can cause both nephrolithiasis and left-sided varicoceles due to venous hypertension. However, this is unlikely to be the cause of this presentation, given the presence of bilateral kidney stones and lack of other associated symptoms (eg, hematuria). 

Option B, cavitary lung lesion, is the most likely associated finding. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common cancer in older males and is associated with smoking, obesity, and uncontrolled hypertension. RCC can present with flank pain, hematuria, and a flank mass, but many cases are now found incidentally on imaging. RCC can also cause paraneoplastic syndromes, including polycythemia (increased hematocrit), hypercalcemia, and hepatic dysfunction (Stauffer syndrome).

9741,"The correct answer is E: Wobble hypothesis.

The wobble hypothesis, proposed by Francis Crick, explains why the third position of a codon (the 'wobble' position) can often tolerate a mismatch with the corresponding position of the tRNA anticodon. This allows for different codons to code for the same amino acid. This mechanism of flexibility at the third position of the codon allows for ""wobbling"" between codon-anticodon pairings.

In this experiment, the sequence CCACCACCA still produces a string of prolines because, according to the wobble hypothesis, even slight alterations in the third position of the codon may not alter the resultant amino acid, hence why it still codes for proline.

Surprisingly, he sees that new amino acids are produced with the first two sequences but that the third sequence is still a string of prolines. Which of the following biochemical principles explains why this phenomenon was observed?
Option: {'A': 'Covalent alterations', 'B': 'mRNA splicing', 'C': 'Translational proofreading', 'D': 'Trimming of proteins', 'E': 'Wobble hypothesis'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is C: Translational proofreading. 

The phenomenon described in the question is related to reading frames during the process of translation. Translation is the process of decoding the mRNA sequence into a polypeptide or protein. This decoding is accomplished by reading the mRNA sequence in sets of three nucleotides known as codons. Each unique codon corresponds to a specific amino acid. Because the reading of the codons always starts from the first nucleotide, if the start point is shifted by one or two nucleotides, a completely different sequence of amino acids would be synthesized. This is the concept of reading frames.

For the sequences provided in the question, ACCACCACC and CACCACCAC would be read as ACC-ACC-ACC (Threonine-Threonine-Threonine) and CAC-CAC-CAC (Histidine-Histidine-Histidine), respectively, while CCACCACCA would be read as CCA-CCA-CCA (Proline-Proline-Proline). The phenomenon of changing the reading frame is not due to covalent alterations (A), mRNA splicing (B), trimming of proteins (D), or the wobble hypothesis (E). 

Covalent alterations are modifications that change the chemical structure of the molecule. mRNA splicing is the process by which introns (non-coding regions) are removed from the pre-mRNA and the remaining exons (coding regions) are joined together. Trimming of proteins refers to the process where certain portions of a protein are cut off after translation. The wobble hypothesis explains why the third base in an mRNA codon can still code for the same amino acid even if it changes (mutates).

Therefore, the phenomenon in the question was due to Translational proofreading (C), where the start point for reading the mRNA sequence was shifted, resulting in different proteins being synthesized."
9756,"The correct answer is A: Cognitive behavioral therapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder.

This patientâ??s symptoms of persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions due to a perceived need to save the items and distress associated with discarding them are characteristic of hoarding disorder. Hoarding disorder is classified under the umbrella of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders in DSM-5. It differs from obsessive-compulsive disorder in the type of obsessions and compulsions present. Rather than having multiple, diverse obsessions and compulsions, individuals with hoarding disorder have difficulty parting with possessions. Hoarding disorder can cause significant distress or impairment, including, as in this patient, preventing the use of living spaces for their intended purposes. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the first-line treatment for hoarding disorder. CBT for hoarding disorder typically includes motivational interviewing, organization and decision-making training, relaxation training, cognitive restructuring (eg, challenging beliefs about the necessity of keeping items), and exposure to discarding and not acquiring items. 

Option B, Admission to a psychiatric facility, is not necessary as the patient's condition does not seem to be posing an immediate threat to her safety or the safety of others.

Option C and D, High dose SSRI for hoarding disorder and Tricyclic antidepressant for hoarding disorder, respectively, are not the first-line treatments for this condition. Although SSRIs may be considered in the treatment, they are usually added to CBT and not used as monotherapy.

This patient's chronic difficulty discarding items, regardless of their actual value, and the resultant clutter that significantly compromises her ability to use living areas in her home is consistent with hoarding disorder. Other characteristic features seen in this patient include significant distress when possessions are discarded, often leading to intense conflicts with family members, and social and occupational impairment. Unlike obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), in which intrusive thoughts (eg, fear of germs) trigger acute anxiety and compulsive behaviors (eg, hand washing), the primary issue in hoarding disorder is difficulty making decisions about discarding items. The first-line treatment for hoarding disorder is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which includes cognitive restructuring, decision-making training, and exposure/response prevention for discarding items.

9773,"This patient's travel history to Southeast Asia, profuse watery diarrhea, and stool culture findings of gram-negative, oxidase-positive, curved rods with a single polar flagellum are consistent with Vibrio cholerae infection. This bacterium uses a toxin (cholera toxin) that permanently activates adenylate cyclase (via ADP-ribosylation of Gs) within intestinal epithelial cells, leading to overproduction of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The increased intracellular cAMP levels stimulate ion transport, leading to secretion of sodium, chloride, and water into the intestinal lumen, causing profuse, ""rice-water"" diarrhea. The severe volume depletion can cause hypovolemic shock if not treated promptly with aggressive fluid and electrolyte repletion.

Option A: 'Acts by activation of guanylate cyclase' is incorrect. While some bacteria (eg, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli) can cause diarrhea by activating guanylate cyclase, V. cholerae acts via activation of adenylate cyclase.

Option B: 'Causes necrosis of Peyer patches of distal ileum' is incorrect. This is a characteristic of Yersinia enterocolitica, which can cause mesenteric adenitis that mimics appendicitis.

9776,"The correct answer is C. Measure fibrin degradation products.

The patient's sudden onset of dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and hypoxemia in the setting of oral contraceptive use (a risk factor for hypercoagulability) strongly suggests the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). Electrocardiography in patients with PE may show sinus tachycardia, nonspecific ST-segment changes, or T-wave inversions. In some cases, it may show findings of right heart strain (eg, S1Q3T3 pattern, right bundle branch block), but these are not sensitive or specific for PE.

The initial diagnostic test for suspected PE is typically computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest. However, a D-dimer test (which measures fibrin degradation products) should be ordered first in patients with a low pretest probability to rule out the diagnosis without the need for further testing (and radiation exposure). This patient's presentation is strongly suggestive of PE, so she has a high pretest probability and should proceed directly to CTA (Choice D). However, CTA is not listed as a choice. Measurement of fibrin degradation products is therefore the most appropriate next step.

Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (Choice A) may be used in patients with acute respiratory failure due to causes such as COPD exacerbation or pulmonary edema. Ibuprofen (Choice B) is not indicated for this patient's symptoms and would not address the underlying problem. Pulmonary angiography (Choice D) is the gold standard for diagnosing PE, but it is invasive and typically reserved for patients in whom less invasive tests (eg, CTA, V/Q scan) are contraindicated or nondiagnostic.

The history and clinical findings are often nonspecific, which makes the diagnosis challenging. Initial testing often consists of a chest x-ray to evaluate for other causes of the patient's symptoms; it is usually normal in patients with PE. The electrocardiogram is often normal or shows nonspecific findings, the most common of which is sinus tachycardia. When the suspicion for PE is high, the diagnosis is confirmed by computed tomography angiography (CTA) because it is highly sensitive and specific and widely available. However, before performing CTA, it is important to assess the patient's risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (eg, in patients with chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus) and potential pregnancy (in women of childbearing age). If CTA cannot be performed, ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scanning can be used to evaluate for PE. In patients with a normal chest x-ray (as in this patient), a high-probability V/Q scan is highly suggestive of PE.

Crohn's disease can involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus, but it most commonly affects the terminal ileum. This patient's findings of fatigue, weakness, pallor, and macrocytic anemia are consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 is absorbed in the terminal ileum, and Crohn's disease can cause inflammation, ulceration, and scarring of the ileum, leading to vitamin B12 malabsorption and subsequent deficiency. The elevation of homocysteine level but normal methylmalonic acid level supports the diagnosis of isolated vitamin B12 deficiency.

Option A, gastrointestinal blood loss, would cause microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency, not macrocytic anemia. Although inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn's can cause GI bleeding, that's not the primary process happening here.

Option B, inflammation of the duodenum, and option D, inflammation of the jejunum, would not cause vitamin B12 deficiency as these parts of the small intestine are not primarily involved in B12 absorption.

Other risk factors for AAD in this patient include advanced age and male sex. AAD is a life-threatening condition that can present with various symptoms, most commonly severe chest pain that is sudden in onset, ripping or tearing in nature, and radiates to the back. If the ascending aorta is involved (Stanford type A), it can lead to involvement of the coronary arteries causing myocardial ischemia, acute heart failure due to aortic insufficiency, or cardiac tamponade. If the descending aorta is involved (Stanford type B), it can lead to malperfusion syndromes of the renal, splanchnic, or spinal arteries. Physical examination is often normal, but can demonstrate a pulse or blood pressure differential between the extremities due to involvement of the great vessels off the aorta.

This patient has a liver abscess caused by Escherichia coli, a gram-negative, lactose-fermenting rod. The most common causes of liver abscesses are biliary tract disease (eg, cholangitis, cholecystitis), followed by appendicitis, diverticulitis, and hematogenous spread from a distant site (eg, endocarditis). In addition to E coli, other common organisms include Klebsiella, Proteus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus species, as well as anaerobes (eg, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Actinomyces). The yellowish-green color of the aspirated fluid is due to the production of pyoverdine, a fluorescent, yellow-green, siderophore pigment produced by certain bacteria (eg, Pseudomonas, E coli) under iron-limiting conditions. Pyoverdine binds ferric iron with high affinity and delivers it to the bacteria, thereby playing a critical role in bacterial iron metabolism and virulence.

9867,"The correct answer is 'D': Decreased FEV1/FVC ratio. 

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive lung disease characterized by fibrosis of the lung interstitium that leads to irreversible loss of lung function. It is typically seen in older adults, particularly those with a history of smoking. The primary symptoms are progressive dyspnea and nonproductive cough. On physical examination, ""Velcro"" crackles can be heard at the lung bases and clubbing is often seen.

Pulmonary function tests in IPF usually show a restrictive pattern with a reduced total lung capacity and normal or increased FEV1/FVC ratio. However, in severe disease or when concurrent emphysema is present (as can occur in smokers), a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio may be seen.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The correct answer is D. 'Decreased FEV1/FVC ratio'

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, irreversible, fibrosing interstitial lung disease of unknown cause. It is characterized by shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance, nonproductive cough, and bilateral inspiratory crackles on lung auscultation. There may be extrapulmonary manifestations such as clubbing of the digits. The FEV1/FVC ratio is used to differentiate obstructive from restrictive lung diseases. In obstructive lung diseases (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma), both FEV1 and FVC are reduced, but the reduction in FEV1 is greater, resulting in a low FEV1/FVC ratio (<0.7). In contrast, restrictive lung diseases (eg, IPF) cause a proportional reduction in FEV1 and FVC, resulting in a normal or increased FEV1/FVC ratio (>0.7). However, lung volume measurements (total lung capacity, functional residual capacity, residual volume) are reduced.

Options A, B, C, and E are incorrect. 

A: Cushing's syndrome is not typically associated with IPF. 

B: Acute exposure to asbestos can lead to asbestosis, a different form of pulmonary fibrosis, but the patient's history does not suggest recent asbestos exposure.

C: While smoking cessation is generally beneficial for lung health, it does not reverse the symptoms of IPF, which is typically progressive even after removal of inciting triggers.

E: Cystic airspaces in the lung interstitium on CT scan are more typical of lung diseases such as emphysema or cystic fibrosis, not IPF. In IPF, a CT scan would more typically show reticular opacities, traction bronchiectasis, and a ""honeycomb"" appearance."
9888,"The correct answer is 'D': Creatinine assessment.

To compensate, the liver increases cholesterol secretion into the bile (Option B), which can promote cholesterol gallstone formation. Cholesterol gallstones may also form due to decreased bile acid concentration (Option E), which is secondary to increased fecal bile acid loss, but the primary mechanism is increased hepatic cholesterol secretion.

9925,"The condition this patient is presenting with is Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), a type of inherited optic neuropathy that leads to bilateral central vision loss. LHON is maternally inherited because it's caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA, which is only passed on from the mother. Therefore, all children of an affected mother have a chance of inheriting the disease, but only daughters can pass it on to subsequent generations. However, it should also be noted that not everyone who inherits the mutation develops the disease. This is because LHON exhibits incomplete penetrance, meaning not everyone who inherits the mutation will show symptoms.

In this case, if we ignore the effects of incomplete penetrance, all of this patient's children, both sons and daughters, will inherit the mutation. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Daughter: 100% and son: 100%' (Option E).

She is worried because both of her older brothers have had visual loss with a similar presentation. Visual exam reveals bilateral loss of central vision with decreased visual acuity and color perception. Pathological examination of this patient's retinas reveals degeneration of retinal ganglion cells bilaterally.

The patient's symptoms and family history (affected brothers but no mention of affected parents) suggest a diagnosis of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). LHON is an inherited mitochondrial disorder that typically presents in young adults with painless, subacute, bilateral vision loss. Mitochondrial diseases are inherited only from the mother because sperm do not contribute mitochondria to the fertilized egg. Therefore, all children of an affected mother will inherit the mutation, but only sons are typically affected because LHON has a sex bias.

However, this patient's children will not be affected because she is a woman and LHON is typically seen in males. Since her husband has no history of the disease, it is assumed that he does not carry the mutation, thus not passing it to their children. 

Options B, C, D, and E are all incorrect because they indicate a risk for the children to be affected by the disease, which is inconsistent with the inheritance pattern of LHON. LHON is inherited only from the mother and typically affects only males. Because the patient is female and her husband does not carry the mutation, their children should not be affected."
9933,"The boy in this question is showing signs of early onset of puberty (pubic hair and voice changes), which is termed precocious puberty. Precocious puberty is considered when the onset of secondary sexual characteristics begins before the age of 8 in girls and 9 in boys. The elevated levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone indicate an issue with an enzyme in the steroid hormone synthesis pathway. 21-hydroxylase is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of 17-hydroxyprogesterone to 11-deoxycortisol in the pathway that leads to the production of cortisol. A deficiency in this enzyme leads to an increase in precursor products, including 17-hydroxyprogesterone. Some of this excess hormone is diverted to the sex hormone pathway, leading to overproduction of androgens and subsequent early onset of puberty. Therefore, the correct answer is C, 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

Option A, 17-Î±-hydroxylase, is incorrect because deficiency of this enzyme leads to a decrease in the production of both glucocorticoids and sex steroids, with an increase in mineralocorticoids. This would not explain the early onset of puberty.

Option B, 5-Î±-reductase, is incorrect because deficiency of this enzyme leads to a disorder of sex development characterized by under masculinization, as this enzyme is needed to convert testosterone into its more potent form, Dihydrotestosterone (DHT).

Option D, 11Î²-hydroxylase, is incorrect because deficiency of this enzyme leads to a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, with hypertension and precocious puberty due to an overproduction of 11-deoxycorticosterone (a mineralocorticoid) and sex steroids. However, this would not result in the high level of 17-hydroxyprogesterone seen in this patient.

9956,"The most appropriate next step in management in this case is option E: 'Evaporative cooling'.

This patient's collapse, nausea, headache, hyperthermia, and dark brown urine are most likely due to exertional heat stroke and rhabdomyolysis. Exertional heat stroke is a potentially fatal condition characterized by an elevated core body temperature (generally >40Â°C/104Â°F) associated with central nervous system dysfunction (eg, confusion, ataxia, seizure, loss of consciousness) in the setting of physical activity. It typically affects young, healthy individuals who exercise in hot conditions, but can also occur in physically active adults with high-intensity jobs (eg, factory work, military training). 

The immediate management of heat stroke involves rapid cooling to decrease mortality. The most effective method in adults is evaporative cooling, typically achieved by misting the body with water and using fans to blow air over the wet skin (option E). In addition, the patient should be undressed and moved to a cool area, if possible. It's also important to monitor core body temperature to avoid overcooling and hypothermia. 

Now to the other options:

Option A: Ice water immersion is the most rapid cooling method but is less safe and poorly tolerated in adults. It can cause shivering which may increase core temperature. It also may reduce cutaneous blood flow and slow the rate of cooling and has been associated with nonfatal ventricular fibrillation. 

Option B: Acetaminophen is used to reduce fever, not hyperthermia associated with heat stroke. This is because heat stroke elevates body temperature by overwhelming the body's thermoregulatory mechanisms, not by resetting the hypothalamic set point.

Option C: Platelet transfusion is incorrect because the patient's platelet count is low but not critically low. Transfusion is typically reserved for counts <10,000/mm3 in asymptomatic patients, or <20,000/mm3 in patients with minor bleeding. 

Option D: A CT scan of the head would be appropriate if there were signs of focal neurologic deficits suggestive of stroke, but this patient's symptoms are more consistent with heat stroke and rhabdomyolysis.

The cause is typically environmental exposure (eg, heat waves, hot workplaces) with concurrent physical exertion, which overwhelms the body's thermoregulatory centers. Heat stroke is a clinical diagnosis and necessitates immediate cooling to prevent progression to rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and death. The most effective method for rapidly lowering core temperature is evaporative cooling (option E) with mist and fans. This method is preferred to immersion in ice water (option A) because shivering can be triggered by the cold, which generates more heat and hampers cooling efforts.

Acetaminophen (option B) is ineffective in heat stroke because hyperthermia is due to an increased hypothalamic set point but rather an overwhelmed thermoregulatory system.

Platelet transfusion (option C) would be inappropriate in this patient, despite his thrombocytopenia. His platelet count is likely low due to disseminated intravascular coagulation secondary to heat stroke, and transfusion would not address the underlying issue.

The ulnar nerve can become entrapped or compressed at several locations along its path, but the location that corresponds with this patient's symptoms is the Guyon canal.

This patient's left-sided headaches, nausea/vomiting, and altered mental status (confusion, only oriented to person), along with the physical exam finding of papilledema, suggest increased intracranial pressure.

Primary amenorrhea is typically defined as the absence of menses by age 15 in the presence of normal secondary sexual characteristics or by age 13 in the absence of secondary sexual characteristics. This patient has normal secondary sexual characteristics, which indicates that she is likely producing estrogen. The main causes of primary amenorrhea in such patients include Mullerian agenesis, transverse vaginal septum, imperforate hymen, androgen insensitivity syndrome, and gonadal dysgenesis (e.g., Turner syndrome).

CD can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus and typically causes transmural inflammation with noncaseating granulomas. Endoscopically, CD usually appears as patchy areas of disease with normal mucosa in between (ie, skip lesions). UC, on the other hand, is limited to the colon and rectum and causes mucosal and submucosal inflammation only. It typically involves the rectum and may extend proximally in a continuous manner to involve part or all of the colon.

E: Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor that can cause high blood pressure. However, it is often accompanied by other symptoms such as headaches, sweating, rapid heart rate, and anxiety. The patient doesn't report these symptoms, making this diagnosis unlikely."
10015,"The patient in the question has a history of alcohol abuse and is now presenting with spontaneous bleeding (ie, from the nose, IV sites) and thrombocytopenia, suggesting alcohol-induced bone marrow suppression. Alcohol is toxic to the bone marrow and can lead to suppression of all hematopoietic cell lines. However, thrombocytopenia is usually the most prominent feature and can lead to increased bleeding. Patients who continue to drink will have persistent marrow suppression, but abstaining from alcohol can lead to recovery of the marrow and an increase in platelet count over days to weeks. In the interim, patients with severe thrombocytopenia and significant bleeding may require platelet transfusion (Choice E).

Desmopressin (Choice A) is a synthetic analog of vasopressin and increases the release of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII. It is used in bleeding caused by von Willebrand disease and mild hemophilia A. Factor VIII concentrate (Choice B) is used in moderate to severe hemophilia A. Both of these options are used in bleeding disorders characterized by normal platelet count and prolonged aPTT.

Fresh frozen plasma (Choice C) contains all clotting factors and is used in bleeding caused by disseminated intravascular coagulation, cirrhosis, or warfarin overdose.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient has signs of chronic liver disease (eg, history of intravenous drug use, hepatitis C, ascites) and has developed coagulopathy, evidenced by his nosebleed, bleeding from the intravenous sites, and thrombocytopenia. In addition, his chronic alcohol abuse likely has led to malnutrition and, consequently, vitamin K deficiency. Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin absorbed in the small intestine and stored in the liver. It is a necessary cofactor for the gamma-glutamyl carboxylase enzyme, which carboxylates and activates several clotting factors (II, VII, IX, and X), as well as proteins C and S. Without vitamin K, these proteins remain in their inactive forms, leading to a bleeding diathesis.

Patients with liver disease have multiple reasons for coagulopathy. They have decreased production of coagulation factors and natural anticoagulants (eg, protein C, protein S, antithrombin), dysfibrinogenemia, thrombocytopenia from hypersplenism, and platelet dysfunction. In addition, cholestasis can lead to malabsorption of vitamin K and subsequent deficiency. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for this patient's bleeding is phytonadione (vitamin K) (Choice D).

Desmopressin (Choice A) increases the release of factor VIII and von Willebrand factor, which could potentially help with hemostasis. However, it would not be the treatment of choice in this patient with liver disease and possible vitamin K deficiency.
Factor VIII concentrate (Choice B) is used in hemophilia A, but this patient likely has a deficiency in multiple clotting factors, not just factor VIII.
Fresh frozen plasma (Choice C) contains all the coagulation factors and could be used in an emergency setting to replace multiple coagulation factors. However, the underlying cause should be addressed (ie, vitamin K deficiency).
Platelet transfusion (Choice E) would be appropriate if this patient's thrombocytopenia were the primary cause of his bleeding. However, his platelet count is not low enough to cause spontaneous bleeding (typically <10,000/mm^3), suggesting another cause."
10021,"This patient's altered mental status, fever, history of alcohol abuse, pancreatitis, and physical exam of a distended and tender abdomen are suggestive of acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol abuse. His hypocalcemia (low serum calcium level) is most likely secondary to this.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient with fever, altered mental status, and diffusely distended, tender abdomen likely has acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol abuse (a common cause of pancreatitis). The markedly low calcium (reference range: 8.4-10.2 mg/dL) is consistent with hypocalcemia, which frequently occurs in the setting of acute pancreatitis due to precipitation of calcium soap in the inflamed pancreas and fatty acids in the peripancreatic fat. Symptoms of hypocalcemia are caused by enhanced neuromuscular excitability and most commonly include perioral numbness, tingling in the extremities (option C), and muscle cramps. More severe manifestations include tetany (option E), characterized by painful muscular contractions, and tonic-clonic seizures. Prolonged QT interval (option D) can also occur, sometimes leading to ventricular arrhythmias.

Hypocalcemia also increases the risk of laryngospasm (option B), but this usually occurs in the setting of acute, severe drops in calcium levels and is less likely in chronic hypocalcemia, as occurs with pancreatitis. Most patients with chronic hypocalcemia are asymptomatic (option A), but the presence of symptoms depends on the severity and duration of hypocalcemia, as well as the rate of decrease in serum calcium levels."
10031,"The patient described in the question has sickle cell anemia, which is due to a point mutation in the beta globin gene of hemoglobin that results in the substitution of valine for glutamic acid. This causes the hemoglobin to polymerize under low oxygen conditions, forming the characteristic sickle-shaped cells that lead to microvascular occlusion and hemolytic anemia. One of the key laboratory findings in hemolytic anemia is an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (Choice B). 

LDH is an intracellular enzyme that is released into the bloodstream when cells are destroyed. In the case of sickle cell anemia, the sickled red blood cells are fragile and easily lysed, resulting in elevated levels of LDH in the serum. 

Now, let's discuss why the other options are incorrect:

A: Bone marrow hyperplasia could occur in response to the chronic hemolysis seen in sickle cell disease, but this is not a specific laboratory finding.

C: Hemoglobinuria, the presence of hemoglobin in the urine, is not typically seen in sickle cell anemia. Hemoglobinuria is more characteristic of conditions like paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria or severe burns.

D: Hemosiderin, an insoluble form of storage iron, can be seen in the urine in conditions of iron overload, such as multiple transfusions or hemochromatosis, but it is not a specific or typical finding in sickle cell anemia.

E: Haptoglobin is a protein that binds free hemoglobin. In conditions of hemolysis, the haptoglobin level would actually be decreased (not increased) because it is being used up to bind the free hemoglobin released from lysed red blood cells.","stop","one of the key laboratory findings in hemolytic anemia is an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) level (choice b).","B","A","USMLE question: An 8-year-old boy has a known genetic condition in which the substitution of thymine for adenine in the 6th codon of the beta globin gene leads to a single-point substitution mutation that results in the production of the amino acid valine in place of glutamic acid.

Option: {'A': 'Bone marrow hyperplasia', 'B': 'Elevated lactose dehydrogenase', 'C': 'Hemoglobinuria', 'D': 'Hemosiderin', 'E': 'Increased serum haptoglobin'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The patient has sickle cell disease, which is caused by a point mutation in the beta globin gene leading to a substitution of the amino acid valine for glutamic acid. This single amino acid change alters the shape of the hemoglobin molecule, causing it to polymerize and deform the red blood cells into a sickle shape under low oxygen conditions. Sickled cells are less flexible and prone to hemolysis, leading to a chronic hemolytic anemia. When red blood cells are broken down, they release their contents into the bloodstream, including hemoglobin. In normal conditions, the body binds free hemoglobin in the bloodstream to haptoglobin, which then gets removed from circulation by the liver. However, in conditions of chronic hemolysis, the amount of free hemoglobin exceeds the body's ability to produce haptoglobin, leading to a decrease in serum haptoglobin levels. Therefore, the patient would most likely have 'E': 'Decreased serum haptoglobin' (your options are incorrect).

Regarding the other options:

'A': 'Bone marrow hyperplasia' is seen in response to anemia, but it is not a laboratory finding.

'B': 'Elevated lactate dehydrogenase' is a nonspecific marker of cell turnover and can be seen in many conditions, including hemolysis. However, LDH is less specific for hemolysis than haptoglobin.

'C': 'Hemoglobinuria' can occur in severe hemolytic episodes, but is not a consistent finding in sickle cell disease.

'D': 'Hemosiderin' is a breakdown product of hemoglobin and can accumulate in tissues as a result of repeated hemolysis and transfusions. However, it would not be detected in the serum and is not a commonly used marker of hemolysis."
10039,"This patient's history of chronic glucocorticoid use for her sarcoidosis, symptoms of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hypotension, and hypoglycemia are suggestive of adrenal insufficiency (AI). AI in this patient is likely due to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis from long-term glucocorticoid therapy. Glucocorticoids suppress the HPA axis by inhibiting the secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamus and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary gland. Over time, this leads to atrophy of the adrenal cortex and a decreased ability to produce cortisol. When the exogenous glucocorticoid is abruptly discontinued or is not increased to cover periods of stress (eg, infection, surgery), the adrenal gland cannot produce the necessary cortisol, leading to AI. Therefore, the answer is 'Decreased corticotropin-releasing hormone' (Option B).

Option A is incorrect because cortisol would be decreased, not increased, in AI. Option C is incorrect because norepinephrine is not directly involved in the HPA axis or cortisol production. Option D is incorrect because aldosterone production is regulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, not the HPA axis. Although long-term glucocorticoid use can affect this system, this patient's symptoms are more indicative of cortisol deficiency.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's findings are suggestive of adrenal insufficiency (AI), characterized by fatigue, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, orthostatic hypotension, and hypoglycemia. AI can be due to primary adrenal failure (eg, adrenal hemorrhage, metastasis, autoimmune adrenalitis) or secondary to pituitary/hypothalamic disease. However, the most common cause of AI in developed countries is iatrogenic, as in this patient, due to abrupt withdrawal of chronic glucocorticoid (GC) therapy. Chronic GC therapy can suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Low plasma cortisol levels remove the normal feedback inhibition to the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, leading to increased secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), respectively (choice E). If exogenous GCs are stopped suddenly, the adrenal glands, which have atrophied due to lack of ACTH stimulation, cannot immediately begin to produce endogenous cortisol, resulting in AI. To prevent this, patients on long-term GC therapy (>3 weeks) should slowly taper the medication under the supervision of a physician.

Increased cortisol (Choice A) would be expected in Cushing syndrome, not AI. Decreased CRH (Choice B) would be found in a hypothalamic cause of AI but would not be expected in this patient, who has iatrogenic AI from chronic, exogenous GC use. Decreased norepinephrine (Choice C) is not directly related to the HPA axis and GC use and does not contribute to this patient's presentation. Decreased aldosterone (Choice D) can be seen in primary AI (eg, Addison disease) but is not a prominent feature in secondary AI, as mineralocorticoid secretion is mainly regulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, not ACTH."
10045,"This patient's symptoms of snoring, daytime sleepiness, and obesity are suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is characterized by episodes of complete (apnea) or partial (hypopnea) cessation of breathing during sleep due to collapse of the pharyngeal airway. This leads to increased work of breathing, resulting in arousals from sleep and subsequent excessive daytime sleepiness. OSA can also exacerbate heart failure and atrial fibrillation by causing negative intrathoracic pressure, intermittent hypoxia, and surges in sympathetic activity. Other risk factors for OSA include male sex, age >60, and craniofacial or upper airway soft tissue abnormalities.

In patients with high pretest probability of OSA (eg, loud snoring, witnessed apneas, and excessive daytime sleepiness), diagnosis can be established with home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) (Choice C). HSAT is a simplified version of polysomnography that can be performed in the patient's home. It usually measures respiratory effort, airflow, and oxygen saturation but does not assess sleep stage or leg movements. HSAT is indicated for patients with a high pretest probability of moderate to severe OSA and no comorbid conditions (eg, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, central sleep apnea, or hypoventilation syndromes). Therefore, it is not the best test for this patient.

In-laboratory polysomnography (Choice D) is the gold standard diagnostic test for OSA, especially for patients with comorbid conditions, and should be performed in this patient. This test involves overnight monitoring of the patient's brain activity (electroencephalogram), eye movements (electrooculogram), muscle activity (electromyogram), heart rhythm (electrocardiogram), and respiratory effort.

ENT evaluation (Choice A) can identify anatomic abnormalities contributing to OSA, but is not typically necessary in patients like this one who have obvious risk factors (eg, obesity, hypertension). Overnight pulse oximetry (Choice B) can show oxygen desaturations, but is less sensitive and specific than polysomnography. Echocardiography (Choice E) may be useful in managing this patient's heart failure, but it is not indicated as the next step in evaluating his OSA symptoms.","stop","","C","D","USMLE question: A 66-year old man comes to the physician because of fatigue for 6 months.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The most appropriate next step in management is 'C': Home sleep apnea testing. This patient with snoring, daytime sleepiness, obesity (body mass index >30 kg/m2), and hypertension likely has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This is a common disorder characterized by repetitive episodes of partial or complete upper airway obstruction during sleep despite respiratory effort. The obstruction is due to reduced muscle tone in the upper airway that occurs during sleep, and it's exacerbated by anything that narrows the airway, such as obesity, a thick neck, or a low-lying soft palate. 

Evidence of upper airway obstruction can include snoring, witnessed apneas, or gasping/choking episodes at night, along with signs of disrupted sleep (eg, nonrestorative sleep, daytime fatigue) or daytime hyper-somnolence. In patients with a high pretest probability of OSA, such as this one, home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) is recommended as the initial diagnostic test. 

HSAT is a simplified version of in-laboratory polysomnography (option D) that can be performed in the patient's own environment. It measures parameters such as respiratory effort, airflow, and oxygen saturation. A positive HSAT can confirm the diagnosis of OSA, and the patient can be referred directly for continuous positive airway pressure therapy. 

In-laboratory polysomnography would be used if the HSAT was negative but clinical suspicion remained high (eg, in a patient with excessive daytime sleepiness and frequent witnessed apneas, but negative HSAT). 

Options A (ENT evaluation) and E (Echocardiography) would not be appropriate at this stage as they do not address the likely diagnosis of OSA.

10049,"The correct answer is E: Iron supplementation. 

This patient's history and clinical presentation suggest iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia worldwide and is often due to blood loss. In reproductive-age women, the most common source of blood loss is the menstrual cycle, particularly in those with menorrhagia, like this patient. Symptoms of anemia, such as fatigue, can occur once hemoglobin levels drop below 11 g/dL. The initial laboratory evaluation for a patient with suspected iron deficiency anemia should include a complete blood count with indices and a peripheral smear, as well as serum iron studies, including ferritin. The diagnosis is confirmed by laboratory results showing a low hemoglobin level, low mean corpuscular volume, and low ferritin level (as ferritin is the stored form of iron). The appropriate management is iron supplementation.

Option A (blood transfusion) is incorrect. A blood transfusion is only indicated in iron deficiency anemia if the patient is hemodynamically unstable or if the hemoglobin level is <7 g/dL.

Option B (Ultrasound of the pelvis) is not needed in this case, because the patient's heavy menstrual cycles most likely explain the cause of her iron deficiency. An ultrasound may be considered if there were concern for a structural abnormality causing the heavy menstrual bleeding.

Option C (Vitamin B12 levels) is not necessary. This patient's low ferritin level and presentation are more suggestive of iron deficiency anemia than vitamin B12 deficiency.

10075,"This patient's hypertension in the setting of abdominal bruits suggest renovascular hypertension, most likely due to bilateral renal artery stenosis. Renal artery stenosis is most commonly caused by atherosclerosis (especially in older patients with vascular risk factors) or fibromuscular dysplasia (especially in young women).

FMD most commonly affects the renal and carotid arteries and most often occurs in women. When FMD involves the renal arteries, renovascular hypertension can result. Findings suggestive of renal artery stenosis include the presence of an abdominal bruit (especially in a young woman) and severe or resistant hypertension. The diagnosis can be confirmed using imaging such as duplex ultrasonography, CT angiography, MR angiography, or catheter-based contrast angiography.

Initial treatment is with antihypertensive medications, but percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is often considered first-line therapy for renal artery FMD causing hypertension. Angioplasty has been shown to result in significant improvement or even cure of hypertension, especially when performed in patients with fibromuscular dysplasia.

Although dietary salt restriction (option A), antihypertensive medications (option B), and weight loss (option E) can generally be helpful in controlling hypertension, they would not be the most appropriate interventions for this patient, given her likely diagnosis of fibromuscular dysplasia. Similarly, surgical endarterectomy (option D) is typically reserved for cases in which percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is unsuccessful or not possible."
10078,"The patient's presentation is consistent with acute kidney injury (AKI) and coagulopathy due to placental abruption (option C: Separation of the placenta from the uterus). Placental abruption is characterized by the premature separation of the placenta from the uterus. It can cause significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The classic presentation includes vaginal bleeding, uterine tenderness, and hypertonic, painful contractions. It can lead to consumptive coagulopathy (also known as disseminated intravascular coagulation or DIC) due to release of thromboplastin from the placental tissue into the maternal circulation and activation of the coagulation cascade. This results in widespread microvascular thrombosis, consumption of coagulation factors and platelets, and secondary fibrinolysis, all of which can lead to bleeding. 

Option A is incorrect because there's no evidence of infection in this patient. Option B is incorrect because there's no history or evidence of liver disease, malnutrition, or vitamin K deficiency, which can cause decreased synthesis of coagulation factors. Option D is incorrect because thromboplastin in maternal circulation is a result of placental abruption and not an underlying mechanism. Option E is incorrect because this option describes amniotic fluid embolism, which typically presents with sudden cardiovascular collapse, respiratory distress, and coagulopathy shortly after delivery.

Other risk factors for LTBI include HIV infection, intravenous drug use, close contact with individuals known to have active tuberculosis, and work in healthcare. Given these risk factors, he should be screened for LTBI with a tuberculin skin test or an interferon-gamma release assay (such as the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test). While both tests have similar sensitivities and specificities, the tuberculin skin test is generally more accessible and less expensive than the interferon-gamma release assay.

This patient's risk factors for tuberculosis (TB) include immigration from a country with high TB prevalence (India), homelessness, and incarceration. In addition, symptoms of TB such as chronic cough, weight loss, night sweats, and fever may not be apparent in individuals with TB infection as these symptoms usually occur in TB disease (reactivation TB). Therefore, this patient should be screened for latent TB infection with either a tuberculin skin test (TST) or an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) such as the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (choice E). However, TST is more commonly used in resource-limited settings such as a community health center because IGRAs are more expensive and require more complex laboratory support.

10129,"The correct answer is B: Macronodular cirrhosis.

This patient's history of chronic alcohol abuse and acute presentation with fever, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite is suggestive of alcoholic hepatitis, which is an acute inflammatory condition of the liver. It is often preceded by a heavy drinking episode. Symptoms include abdominal pain, fever, and hepatic dysfunction, with or without jaundice. Laboratory findings typically reveal an AST level that is greater than the ALT level, often with a ratio of 2:1 or higher. However, in the setting of alcohol abuse, both levels are usually less than 300 U/L. A liver biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing alcoholic hepatitis and may show fatty change, hepatocyte necrosis, neutrophilic infiltration, and pericellular fibrosis, features of alcoholic steatohepatitis. Over time, chronic inflammation can lead to the development of macronodular cirrhosis (option B), characterized by regenerative nodules surrounded by dense bands of fibrous tissue.

Option A: T-lymphocyte infiltration is associated with viral hepatitis.
Option C: Positive periodic acid-Schiff stain is associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, not alcoholism.

10137,"The best next step in the management of this patient would be 'C': Fine needle aspiration with cytology.

This patient's new-onset palpitations, tremor, weight loss, and anxiety are symptoms of hyperthyroidism. The presence of a thyroid nodule in a patient with symptoms of hyperthyroidism increases the likelihood of a toxic adenoma, a solitary autonomously functioning thyroid nodule that produces excess thyroid hormone independent of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) control. However, a thyroid nodule in a young patient with a history of childhood cancer (neuroblastoma) raises concern for a second primary malignancy, such as papillary thyroid carcinoma, which is the most common type of thyroid cancer. Therefore, this patient should undergo fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the thyroid nodule for cytologic examination to exclude malignancy.

Now let's discuss why the other options are incorrect.

Option A: 'Ultrasound examination' - An ultrasound can be useful for further characterizing the nodule (eg, solid, cystic, mixed), but it does not provide definitive diagnosis, which can only be made with cytologic or histologic examination.

Option B: 'Radionuclide thyroid scan' - This type of scan is used to differentiate between functioning (hot) and non-functioning (cold) nodules. However, this patient's nodule is suspicious for malignancy, which requires FNA for diagnosis.

Option D: 'Life-long monitoring' - Without definitive diagnosis via FNA, merely monitoring the patient is not appropriate due to the risk of malignancy.

Hot nodules are rarely malignant. If the thyroid scan shows that the nodule is not producing hormone (cold nodule), it would then be reasonable to pursue fine needle aspiration to rule out malignancy.

Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's anemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly, along with the finding of rigid red blood cells, suggest a diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis (HS). HS is the most common cause of hereditary hemolysis and is due to defects in proteins associated with the red blood cell (RBC) cytoskeleton (eg, ankyrin, band 3, a or Ã? spectrin). This results in loss of membrane stability and formation of small, round RBCs (spherocytes) that are less deformable and more likely to be sequestered and destroyed in the spleen, causing hemolytic anemia. On peripheral smear, spherocytes appear smaller and lack the central pallor seen in normal RBCs.

HS is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, although autosomal recessive and de novo mutations have also been described. Autosomal dominant conditions typically present in multiple generations, with males and females equally affected. Unlike autosomal recessive conditions, only one affected allele needs to be present for phenotypic expression.

The patient has a past medical history of obesity, diabetes, constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis that is in remission, and a 70 pack-year smoking history. The patient has a family history of breast cancer in his mother and prostate cancer in his father. His temperature is 98.9Ã?Â°F (37.2Ã?Â°C), blood pressure is 160/87 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an obese man in no current distress. Abdominal exam reveals a non-tender and non-distended abdomen with normal bowel sounds. An abdominal radiograph and barium swallow are within normal limits. Which of the following is an appropriate treatment for this patientÃ¢â?¬â?¢s condition?
Option: {'A': 'Cautery of an arteriovenous malformation', 'B': 'Ciprofloxacin', 'C': 'Mesalamine enema', 'D': 'Surgical removal of malignant tissue', 'E': 'Surgical resection of a portion of the colon'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","This patient's painless rectal bleeding is concerning for colon cancer. His age, long history of smoking, and history of ulcerative colitis all significantly increase his risk. His recent camping trip is a red herring in this case - although drinking untreated water can lead to infectious diarrhea, it would not cause painless rectal bleeding. Initial management of colon cancer is with surgical resection of the tumor and affected lymph node basins (Choice E). 

Choice A (Cautery of an arteriovenous malformation) would be incorrect as there is no information suggesting the presence of an arteriovenous malformation, which would typically present with hematemesis or melena, not hematochezia. 

Choice B (Ciprofloxacin) would be used for infectious diarrhea, but the patient's presentation is inconsistent with this diagnosis. 

Choice C (Mesalamine enema) is used for ulcerative colitis flares, but the patient's disease is in remission and his presentation is not typical for a flare.

Choice D (Surgical removal of malignant tissue) is halfway correct but lacks the crucial aspect of removing affected lymph node basins, which is key in preventing metastatic disease. 

In this patient with likely colon cancer, the next step in management would be colonoscopy for definitive diagnosis."
10169,"The correct answer is option 'E': Serum measurement of alpha-fetoprotein.

This patient's presentation of bilateral renal masses, history of chronic flank pain, and a family history of kidney disease and ovarian cancer is suggestive of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of multiple benign and malignant tumors. The most common manifestations of VHL include hemangioblastomas (often in the cerebellum, spinal cord, or retina), clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), pheochromocytomas, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Therefore, his family history, along with the presentation of bilateral renal masses and hypertension (possibly secondary to RCC), indicate a likelihood of VHL. 

Alpha-fetoprotein is not directly related to VHL disease but is often elevated in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors of the testis. However, given that RCC is a common manifestation of VHL, and that alpha-fetoprotein can be elevated in some patients with RCC, this test could potentially aid in confirming the diagnosis.

The other options are less likely to be beneficial in this scenario:

Option A (stress echocardiography) and B (coronary angiography) are generally used to evaluate heart disease, which is not suggested by the patient's presentation.

Option C (CT angiography of the head) could be useful if the patient had symptoms suggesting a brain tumor, such as headaches, seizures, or neurologic deficits, which he does not.

Option D (chest X-ray) can be used to identify lung diseases or metastatic cancer, but the patient's presentation and medical history do not suggest these conditions.","stop","the correct answer is option 'e': serum measurement of alpha-fetoprotein.","E","C","USMLE question: A 53-year-old man presents with a 2-year-history of dull, nonspecific flank pain that subsides with rest. His past medical history is significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has no allergies and takes no medications. His father died of kidney disease at the age of 51, and his mother has been treated for ovarian cancer. On presentation, his blood pressure is 168/98 mm Hg, and his heart rate is 102/min. Abdominal examination is significant for palpable bilateral renal masses. His laboratory tests are significant for creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL and a BUN of 22 mg/dL. Which of the following tests is most recommended in this patient?
Option: {'A': 'Stress echocardiography', 'B': 'Coronary angiography', 'C': 'CT angiography of the head', 'D': 'Chest X-ray', 'E': 'Serum measurement of alpha-fetoprotein'}
Please explain your answer and why the other options are wrong","The answer is D: Chest X-ray. 

This patient likely has Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) given his family history and the physical finding of bilateral renal masses. It is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous cysts in the kidneys. These cysts can slowly replace much of the kidneys, reducing kidney function and leading to kidney failure. ADPKD can also cause cysts to develop in your liver and elsewhere in your body. The disease can cause serious complications, including high blood pressure and kidney failure. The most serious complication of ADPKD is a burst cyst causing a brain or aortic aneurysm. That's why it's important to monitor for these potentially life-threatening complications. 

A chest X-ray is the most appropriate next step in management in this patient to assess for pulmonary cysts and other extrarenal manifestations of ADPKD. 

Stress echocardiography (Option A) and coronary angiography (Option B) are typically used to evaluate for ischemic heart disease, which is not suggested by this patient's non-specific flank pain that subsides with rest. CT angiography of the head (Option C) could be considered if the patient had symptoms of a cerebral aneurysm such as sudden severe headache, but this patient's symptoms are not suggestive of that. Serum measurement of alpha-fetoprotein (Option E) is used to screen for hepatocellular carcinoma and certain germ cell tumors, which are not suggested by this patient's presentation or family history."
