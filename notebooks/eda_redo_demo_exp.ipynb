      "Two points of feedback on specific questions. For the question about the hepatic adenoma case, the GPT model provided the correct answer as stated (contraceptive pill) with correct reasoning, so no error was noticed. Also, for the question about the mechanism of action of ipratropium bromide, the correct answer provided was wrong. The answer should be cGMP. Hence, while GPT did not give this answer, I found it was invalid to comment on errors for this question.                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",

The instructions were as clear as could be, it definitely took me a while to get in the swing of things choosing an error code, but by the 10th question I felt a lot more confident. With the initial questions, I felt like I was overthinking too much. I felt that the time allotted for this study was perfect. One suggestion would be to fix the audio in the Youtube instructions; I felt the audio was very low even at 100% volume. Also in the future, if possible,  having a \"test round\" where you first actively learn to annotate the question and get feedback on it immediately could be beneficial. Other than that, everything was great!    1\n",

      "Two points of feedback on specific questions. For the question about the hepatic adenoma case, the GPT model provided the correct answer as stated (contraceptive pill) with correct reasoning, so no error was noticed. Also, for the question about the mechanism of action of ipratropium bromide, the correct answer provided was wrong. The answer should be cGMP. Hence, while GPT did not give this answer, I found it was invalid to comment on errors for this question.\n",

      "Everything went great! The instructions were as clear as could be, it definitely took me a while to get in the swing of things choosing an error code, but by the 10th question I felt a lot more confident. With the initial questions, I felt like I was overthinking too much. I felt that the time allotted for this study was perfect. One suggestion would be to fix the audio in the Youtube instructions; I felt the audio was very low even at 100% volume. Also in the future, if possible,  having a \"test round\" where you first actively learn to annotate the question and get feedback on it immediately could be beneficial. Other than that, everything was great!\n",
